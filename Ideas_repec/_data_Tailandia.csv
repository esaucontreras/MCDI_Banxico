It also aims to shed light on two puzzling pieces of evidence. These are (i) the observation of low and declining unemployment rates while recent firm surveys indicate and apparent lack of both the quality of labor supply, and (ii) the stagnant growth of educational real wages in the face of tightening .abor market. Using macro and micro-level dataset, the paper addresses the fundamental problems of the labor market and draws a set of policy recommendations for improving labor market efficiency and enhancing the country's competitiveness."

This paper is divided into two sections, namely Macro and Micro Analysis. In the first part,the results from panel data regressions suggest that economic growth is associated with financial development. Financial development in terms of bank lending and market capitalization also creates capital growth and productivity. Going forward, bank and markets should be developed concurrently so as to provide a driving force for economic expansion."

The country case studies and statistical performance showed that the central bank capital erosion does not directly relate to the policy effectiveness, but it creates the vulnerabilities to the monetary policy process. The key factor helping achieve the policy objectives, even with the losses or negative capital is “central bank credibility”. The policy choices to reduce such vulnerabilities are also discussed in this paper."

 """,2012.,Financial Systemic Stability: Challenging Aspects of Central Banks,"2012-06, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","Since 2007 global financial crisis, many central banks have tended to focus on financial stability much more than ever. Lessons learned from recent crises witness that in a period of sustained economic growth with low and stable inflation, financial imbalances could adversely affect financial system and real economy, which eventually leads to financial crises. In addition, the cost of crises becomes increasingly expensive over time because crises themselves have been more systemic. Risk from one financial institution can easily transfer to others and then to the whole financial market. Thus, current crises highlight the importance of financial stability role of central banks in two main aspects, crisis prevention and crisis management. The paper indicates that in recent financial crises, many central banks have stepped beyond their traditional roles in order to ensure financial system stability. Some instruments and measures that central banks have implemented can be considered as unconventional ones. Looking forward, these practices then lead to new challenges for central banks in three main aspects: risk identification, risk mitigation, and policy issuance process. Eventually, this paper also provides policy implications to Bank of Thailand, based on international experiences and lessons learned from recent crises."

The difference in the conduct of monetary policy lies in the instrument they use not in the monetary policy regime per se. The paper finds that the higher the level of financial development, the higher degree of monopoly power (uniqueness) in exports and the stronger the institution, the more likely a country will use interest rate as the main monetary policy instrument. Furthermore, based on three criteria: (1) controllability of policy instrument and monetary conditions (2) the degree of counter-cyclicality and (3) the effectiveness of instrument in influencing inflation and output, interest rate appears to be an appropriate monetary policy instrument for Thailand. So far, performance of the current monetary policy framework in Thailand has been fine, with transparency through communication with the general public being one of the key factors contributing to the performance and policy effectiveness."

 """,2012.,"Economic Rationales for Central Banking: Historical Evolution, Policy Space, Institutional Integrity, and Paradigm Challenges","2012-04, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","The late-2000s global financial crisis saw increased public profiles and balance sheets of both the US and European central banks, their combined series of financial rescue measures in effect pushing the envelope of central banking modus operandi. And in general, somewhat anecdotally amongst non-crisis Asia-Pacific/emerging economies, central banks are under increased pressure to pursue growth agenda, or at least being publicly called to task as to whether strict inflation regime is all that necessary. All the while, orthodox economics appear to be bursting at the seams, as the world witnesses extreme financial-capital market events increasingly becoming the ‘new normal’, globalised banking system portending knife-edged stability dynamics consistent with high degree of epidemic, network-like systemic interconnectivities, and global catastrophe phenomena reflecting energy/ecological/environmental imbalances more and more frequently materialising as economic disequilibria. Taken together, it is only becoming more difficult to reconcile historical evolution of central banks (the institutions) and central banking (the mandate) with ever mounting stabilisation policy demands and global ‘mega-trend’ challenges over the next decades. This essay details our positive and normative analysis and posits our conceptual arguments concerning the very essence of central banks (the institutions) and central banking (the discipline). We begin with Historical Evolution, from the genesis of early ‘proto’ central banks to the emergence of modern consensus on central banking. Stylised facts and conceptual schemas drawn from that exercise then enables us to formulate the notion of Policy Space as a generalization of central bank role and responsibility. We then employ economic rationales to argue for and advocate key elements and principles in terms of Institutional Integrity as an imperative foundation for the pursuit of policy goals. The emerging evolutionary perspective also compels us to postulate a number of Paradigm Challenges facing current and future generations of central bankers."

 """,2012.,"Proposal of New Hybrid PD Estimation Models for the Low Default Portfolios (LDPs), Empirical Comparisons and Policy Implications","2012-03, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","I proposed the new group of hybrid models to be used for the probability of default (PD) estimation on low default portfolios (LDPs). The construction of this hybrid model class was based upon the two existing estimation approaches–the most prudent estimation of Pluto and Tasche (2006) and Forrest (2005)’s maximum likelihood method. These new hybrid models possess the robust framework from the maximum likelihood concept but, unlike the original likelihood approach, the PD computation is much less intensive for rating models with many rating grades. Moreover, I found that the proposed hybrid models yield more conservative PDs than the existing LDP models, provided that the observed default rates satisfied specific conditions outlined in this paper. In addition to the theoretical construction of the models, this paper also gives the mathematical proofs of the necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure rank ordering of PD estimates from the hybrid models as well as the proofs of the conditions needed to guarantee the conservatism of the hybrid PDs when compared to other estimation method."

The comparison results give insightful information to bank supervisors and banks regarding the PD model validation and possible underestimation of PD values. We found that the most conservative approaches tend to be that of Pluto and Tasche (2006) and Roengpitya (2012) while Van Der Burgt (2007) seemed to yield the least conservative estimates. Moreover, for prudent supervisory purposes, we suggested that the accuracy ratio (AR) in the Van Der Burgt (2007) CAP curve method should be restricted to be between 40% and 80% to prevent a possible underestimation of credit risk. Finally, we presented the necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that the rank ordering of PD estimates from Pluto and Tasche (2006)’s most prudent approach is satisfied."

We find that Thailand’s home-bias is high compared to other countries’ home-bias and it decreases at a slower pace over time. The study also shows that a country with higher levels of home-bias experiences lower international risk sharing and has more volatile consumption patterns during the sample period of 1970 to 2010. To strengthen Thailand’s resiliency to unexpected economic shocks and maintain country’s economic welfare through better consumption smoothing, the policy challenges identified in this paper include capital outflow measures, tax policy, coherent institutional supports and guidelines to improve investors’ internationalized skills."

 """,2011.,Dealing with Structural Change: A Diagnosis of the Thai Economy,"2011-04, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","The entry of China into the global economy and regional economic integration is ushering in a new global production structure. Thailand will have to find her place in this new global order by embracing internal structural change. The paper finds that Thailand will have to confront sizeable structural change due to global developments. And depending on how global and domestic developments play out, there are wide-ranging possibilities on how Thailand may transform structurally. Nevertheless, no matter what possibility materializes, the Thai economy’s smooth transformation rests on its adaptability and resiliency. We focus on adaptability in terms of physical mobility and resiliency in terms of firm resiliency to shocks. Thailand’s physical capital mobility is adequate by international standards, but rigidities exist in sectors that lack competition or financial access. At the firm level, the overall picture is that of resiliency to shocks, but there are firms in non-competitive sectors that appear particularly vulnerable. On overall, the Thai economy is adaptable and resilient but will be challenged by imminent and substantial structural change; the Thai economy must build adaptability and resiliency from within. For example, policymakers can facilitate resource allocation by fostering competition and sustaining financial sector liberalization. Firms should enhance productivity, seek out opportunities in new markets, prepare for regional competition and manage financial risk more carefully."

 """,2011.,"AEC 2015: Ambitions, Expectations and Challenges ASEAN's Path towards Greater Economic and Financial Integration","2011-03, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","The formation of the AEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015 is an important milestone in the process of ASEAN integration. The challenge for members is to tap on the gains of integration while staying prepared for changes. As financial integration is part of this process, it is important to reap benefits by creating a mutually reinforcing “virtuous circle” of financial integration: having more willingness in financial liberalization would—through increased competition and technology transfer—support the development of the financial sector, which, in turn, will support further liberalization. We aim to quantify the extent of liberalization under the AEC Blueprint and the current state of implementation, and come to the conclusion that it does not aim towards full liberalization in all areas, with implementation currently lagging behind in some areas. Importantly, Thailand’s present willingness to liberalize the financial sector trails other ASEAN peers. However, relevant indicators of financial development and institutional environment reveal that Thailand’s readiness is relatively on par with its peers. We therefore come to the policy recommendation that Thailand has room to accelerate its liberalization process under the Blueprint, particularly in the area of financial liberalization. Key to this is the adoption of an “integration mindset” by incorporating regional integration issues into domestic laws, regulations and master plans, which will ultimately give thrust to the aforementioned “virtuous circle”."

 """,2011.,China's Growth in Transition: Implications for the Thai Economy,"2011-02, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","China has rapidly emerged as a global economic superpower and is expected to remain the main growth driver in the next phase of the global economy. Questions often raised are: How long can China’s extraordinary growth be sustained? What direction the Chinese economy is heading towards and what does it imply about opportunities and risks for other countries, including Thailand from our point of interest? From a review of China’s growth pattern and an in-depth analysis of sources of growth, we put forward that, in the short to medium term, China’s potential output growth will remain strong driven mainly by continued capital deepening. In the longer term, however, factor market distortions, misallocation of resources, and the demographic shift in China will increasingly become the key bottlenecks to China’s sustainable growth. Realizing these growth limitations, the Chinese leaders have recently shifted the growth paradigm by resorting to technology leapfrogging in lifting productivity and moving up the value chain. This will significantly change the future pattern of production and exports in China. The Thai economy has greatly benefited from the rising of the Chinese economy through various trade channels. But in order for Thailand to continue to reap these benefits, a sole reliance on the same export pattern will not be enough. Thailand should learn from China’s success in productivity and industrial upgrading and technological advancement, as serious efforts in this direction are much needed for Thailand to escape the middle income trap."

It is found that consumption, after conditioning for income and household characteristics, is increasing in wealth, whether measured in terms of net worth or gross asset values. The estimated elasticity of consumption with respect to wealth is 0.06, while the estimated income elasticity is 0.60. The corresponding marginal propensity to consume out of wealth is estimated to be around 0.02-0.03. Physical assets, such as housing, matter for consumption more than financial assets, with the elasticity being about five-fold larger. Durable goods consumption is found to be much more sensitive to wealth than consumption of non-durable goods. The paper also discusses evidence that wealth e ects may vary across households, and can be explained by the levels of existing wealth and certain household characteristics."

 """,2010.,Financing Thailand for Balanced and Sustainable Growth,"2010-06, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","As the global economic outlook remains uncertain, there is the need for Asia to step up and take a new position as the driving force of the world economy. This means that Thailand needs to adjust herself to the new challenges of increased bank competition, more capital inflows as well as more domestic funding needs. The paper attempts to analyze and provide policy recommendations as to how to deal with the stated challenges and turn them into our advantages by means of efficiently utilizing the financial sector to finance the real sector in order to move the economy forward. Three possible policies worth considering are: (1) commercial banks should be more efficient by means of promoting competition (2) financial access and inclusiveness should be enhanced (3) lending infrastructure and the depth of the financial market should be improved. Although, the essence of these policies is addressed in the phase II of Financial Sector Master Plan, challenges remain as to how to implement them. Furthermore, the cooperation and commitment among concerned parties should not be taken lightly."

We explore investment dynamics in details using both macro and micro analysis in order to formalize appropriate investment policies for Thailand. Our findings from macro analysis indicate that lower investment during post 1997 crisis were mainly attributable to lower GDP growth, lower domestic credit growth and lower terms of trade. Moreover, Thailand’s relative lacks of public investment in comparison to neighboring countries were one of the reasons which caused sub-par private investment performances. At the micro level, we found that structural issues such as degree of competition, product standards, financial access and financial costs are inhibited factors affecting firm’s probability of investment. Legal issues which delayed investment projects were also examined. In order to unleash Thailand’s investment, the government must tackle the problems at both macro and micro levels. Not doing so would risk Thailand falling behind her competitors."

The Credit Crisis left G4 economies considerably weaker in light of the massive fiscal debt, fragile banking sector balance sheets, as well as the nearly maxed-out space for macroeconomic policies. Meanwhile, despite initial setbacks, EM Asia seemed to poise for robust growth going forward and is expected to become the second engine of global growth after the US. In the next decade, EM Asia growth will likely be driven by the prospects of its own regional demand from burgeoning middle class as a result of fast transition from the primary sector to higher-paying manufacturing and service sectors. Additionally, supply side factors will provide significant support for EM Asia growth going forward through the improvement in TFP from intensifying regional production network and frugal innovation, as well as the rise in capital accumulation from greater infrastructure investment and intra-regional FDI. However, for the real sector growth to achieve its full potential, more effective financing that is efficient and inclusive will be needed. The resiliency of the financial system will also be a key factor that must be monitored closely and enhanced to ensure the sustainability of economic growth."

 """,2010.,Measuring Systemic Risk And Financial Linkages In The Thai Banking System,"2010-02, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","This paper addresses the measurement issues of systemic risk in the Thai banking sector. The concept of conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR), due to Adrian and Brunnermeier (2008), was used to quantify the level of systemic risk and financial linkages among six major Thai commercial banks over the period of 1996Q2-2009Q1. Intuitively, CoVaR measures the degree of ‘risk externalities’ that a single institution imposes on the system. We found that there was additional risk imposed onto the overall system by individual banks, both during the Asian crisis time and in subsequent periods. There is some evidence that larger banks contribute more to this systemic risk, as measured by the concept of “?CoVaR,” but size is far from being a dominant factor. We further apply the concept of CoVaR to measure the financial linkage between any two banks and investigate the changing nature of the linkages over time as well as other bank characteristics that drive such inter-bank relationships. These measures of risk externalities serve as a useful additional toolbox to the regulators, and themselves have novel regulatory implications."

(2007). In this study, the competition level in the loan market of the Thai banking industry is calculated both in aggregate of time and by year, from 1994-2004. In addition, for comparison purposes, I also re-assess the level of competition in the loan market of the U.S. banks, using the data from the CALL Report during the years 1994-2004, which is different from the original paper that uses the Bankscope data from 1999- 2004. The results indicate that the Thai banking industry is much less competitive when compared to the U.S. banking industry and bears higher marginal costs, which consequently translates to lower efficiency. Finally, it is worth noting that the method of estimating the translog cost function diverges from the EU paper in a sense that the states’ fixed effects are included in this study and that the marginal cost equation is estimated differently due to the use of a different marginal cost equation."

Illustrated in a New Keynesian framework where the microeconomic foundation with rigidities of various types is the central feature, the paper starts with an important reminder of the reason why central banks need to focus on inflation as their primary objective. Once the mandate of price stability is established, the next question that follows is: Which measure(s) of inflation, according to theory, is most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy? While the literature broadly suggests that, under certain assumptions, stabilizing a target index that puts more weight on the stickier prices is a better policy, it has mostly come to a conclusion that the monetary authority should be mindful of developments in a broad variety of prices. As a result, while the choice of the policy target in the case of Thailand comes down to core inflation, in its implementation of the inflation targeting framework, the Bank of Thailand also looks at several indicators that help gauge as accurately as possible underlying price pressures."

In recent years, a number of studies have shown that investors' private information plays a central role in determining exchange rates. We demonstrate in this paper that the private information of investors relevant for exchange rates is largely connected to the stock market, and that this information is conveyed to foreign exchange (FX) markets by order ow that is induced by investors' transactions in the stock market. We establish these results by analyzing several novel unused datasets on nearly two years' worth of daily-frequency capital ows of nonresident investors in the foreign exchange, stock, and bond markets of Thailand. We present compelling evidence that FX order ow that is induced by nonresident investors transactions in the Stock Exchange of Thailand|which we show are driven largely by private information|has far greater explanatory power for the exchange rate than other order ow has, both in the short run and the long run. In contrast, FX order ow of nonresident investors that is related to their transactions in Thai government bonds|which we nd are not driven appreciably by private information|does not have a statistically significant effect on the exchange rate."

 """,2009.,Thailand’s Medium-term Macroeconomic Policies: Major Challenges and Appropriate Responses,"2009-05, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","This paper aims to identify major medium-term challenges facing the Thai economy as a result of the Sub-prime financial crisis as well as the public policy reactions following the crisis before providing appropriate recommendations. Over the medium term, Thailand’s economic recovery may be subject to its ability to lift the level of potential output that has been lowered during the crisis from subdued investment and confidence; concerns over fiscal sustainability; as well as increased risks to asset prices and inflation, possibly through large capital inflows into the region induced by world excess liquidity. Appropriate fiscal policy calls for the balancing between the short-run growth stimulus and the long-run potential output elevation for a sustainable recovery. Fiscal measures must be carefully designed and budget effectively disbursed. The role of expenditure automatic stabilizer should be enhanced to lend greater flexibility in support of the economy during possible future challenges, while also formulate a clear plan for fiscal consolidation to preserve sustainability. On the other hand, monetary policy likely encounters limitation on continued easing stance due to rising inflationary pressure as economic recovery solidifies. Nonetheless, monetary discipline and price stability will foster as the potential economic growth over the long run. In addition, the role of central bank in preserving financial stability needs to be fortified by macro-prudential measures which are more targeted and flexible in conjunction with the option in interest rate policy, only when there are no conflicts to monetary policy objectives, to contain the financial imbalances as a detrimental risk factor to the overall economic stability."

Issues discussed in this study involve: (i) financial linkages and systemic risk assessment; (ii) procyclicality of the financial system; (iii) appropriate regulatory arrangement, bank governance and executive compensation. Regarding the systemic risk issue, we found evidence of negative externalities imposed onto the banking system value-at-risk (VaR) by banks and other types of financial institutions such as finance, securities and insurance companies. Therefore, bank regulators needs to be aware of the additional risk imposed onto the system during distress time and take this into account when assessing the risk level of banks. Next, the results from panel data regressions suggested that the level of procyclicality decreased from the pre-Asian Crisis period when compared to the post-crisis period. Moreover, the nature of cyclicality differed by asset classes. Therefore, we proposed that, if their goal was to mitigate excessive cyclicality, supervisors must also take into account types of loans as well. Finally, the paper outlines the importance of implementing regulatory statues that will minimize regulatory arbitrage as well as promoting cautious financial innovations and bank governance, which were identified as a few of the fundamental causes leading to the onset of the U.S. financial crisis."

It is found that the export sector has been the significant provider of income for the economy and the most important engine of growth since 1997. Due to the small domestic market, domestic demand would not be able to replace exports as the superior engine in the medium and long term Besides, the Thai economy will still need to depend on the export sector for investment, employment and particularly productivity improvement. However, strengthening domestic demand would be crucial for the economy as 1) it would need to perform the important role as a buffer against negative foreign demand shocks and 2) there is the need to expand domestic demand especially investment to help ensure economic recovery as well as achieve sustainable long term growth."

In fact, one feeds the other, and both are mutually dependent. Adverse ?nancial conditions have the potential to exacerbate negative disturbances on the real economy| converting the initial e?ects of small and short-lived shocks into large and persistent impacts| and consequently generate a downward spiral in which such adverse ?nancial conditions and the deterioration in the macroeconomy feed into each other. A key factor causing the ampli?cation mechanism is the negative relationship between the external ?nance premium and the quality of borrowers' balance sheets|the latter is summarized by how much the balance sheet is saddled with debt relative to internal funds. Empirical evidence points to the existence in the Thai economy of this negative relation. Incorporating this feature in a well-articulated model for Thailand that emphasizes the crucial role of the balance sheets of ?rms and banks in a small open economy allows us to assess the degree of feedbacks between ?nancial and real variables. The key parameter a?ecting the intensity of the feedback e?ects is the elasticity of the external ?nance premium to borrowers' ?nancial health that could temporarily increase during crises. We urge policymakers to look forward and be ready to forestall such a likely feedback loop, and, if it sets o?, must react with su?cient vigor in a timely manner to arrest this corrosive self-reinforcing mechanism."

Three variables are utilized to capture separate exchange rate effects. The bilateral exchange rate to the US$ captures the value of local currency (a higher value implies a cheaper currency and attracts FDI). Changes in real effective exchange rate index (REER) proxy for expected changes in the exchange rate: an increasing (decreasing) REER is interpreted as devaluation (appreciation) being expected, so that FDI is postponed (encouraged). The transitory component of bilateral exchange rates is a proxy for volatility of local currency, which discourages FDI. The results support the ‘Chakrabarti and Scholnick’ hypothesis that, ceteris paribus, there is a negative relationship between the expectation of local currency depreciation and FDI inflows. Cheaper local currency (devaluation) attracts FDI as volatile exchange rates discourage FDI."

Evidence from Thailand,"2008-09, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","It is widely argued that foreign investment is a mechanism for improving corporate governance in emerging markets. The results of this paper, which uses firm-level data on 365 Thai firms, challenge this conventional wisdom. A firm-specific index of the quality of corporate governance is constructed and used to test the hypothesis that foreign investment has a positive effect on corporate governance. Endogeneity problems are addressed by using long-standing statutory limits on foreign ownership as an instrument for foreign investment. The results show that the form of foreign investment matters. When foreign industrial companies hold large stakes, there is no improvement in corporate governance. If anything the opposite is true; it appears that foreign industrial investors act as insiders: they favor weak corporate governance because it allows them to exploit minority shareholders. In contrast, purchases of minority stakes by foreign institutional investors lead to improvements in corporate governance. I also find that corporate governance is poorer for firms whose major foreign owner comes from a country with relatively weak governance institutions."

The banking legislation in the 1990s permits banks to merge across states and also motivates states to relax other banking restrictions. Using the panel data of about 1900 banks in 14 states for 3 years, I find that banks in states with intrastate branching deregulation have a lower proportion of outside board directors (OBDs) and banks in states with interstate banking and the bank holding company deregulation have a higher percentage of OBDs. De novo entry deregulation also leads to a higher percentage of OBDs, although the effect is not so significant. Moreover, using two-stage regressions, I am able to show that interstate deregulation, notably interstate banking and de novo entry, impacts the board composition through takeover possibilities. Therefore, the substitute hypothesis, stating that a takeover threat and OBD monitoring are substitutes in controlling managers, does not seem to hold for the banking industry. Finally, by performing additional two-stage regressions, I find that the board composition change resulted from intrastate branching deregulation arises from bank branching behavior."

Within the same framework, we measure the effect of an increase in the policy interest rate by the Bank of Thailand on key domestic economic variables over time, allowing for the possibility that global forces may matter more for Thai economic dynamics over the recent years. With some measure of confidence, we find that global macroeconomic and financial influence matters for Thailand’s economic dynamics. Whether global forces have gained in importance is inconclusive for the overall economy, but that influence has intensified for several selected variables. We have also detected and identified statistically significant changes in the relationship between international forces and Thailand’s economic dynamics over the past several years. Statistical evidence shows that recent changes in monetary policy effectiveness are not likely due to direct influence from globalization, but are mostly due to the change in the relationship among domestic variables themselves over time. Mindful that we may not have sufficient data to get a strong statistical conclusion, but monetary policy’s ability to influence overall domestic events seems to have been somewhat diminished, with no evidence that this is due to globalization. The ability of the central bank to ensure long-term price stability, however, seems to have remained largely intact."

 """,2008.,Roles of Exchange Rate in Monetary Policy under Inflation Targeting: A Case Study for Thailand,"2008-03, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","This paper addresses the roles of exchange rate in monetary policy under inflation targeting (IT) regime, with a particular focus on Thailand. The analysis will examine the role of exchange rate as a channel of monetary policy transmission mechanism, its role as a shock absorber and the plausibility of an additional role in mitigating inflationary pressure. To investigate these issues, the paper primarily employs a Small Structural Model to capture the relationship between the exchange rate and other macroeconomic variables, in conjunction with other statistical and econometric techniques. The analytical results indicate that, besides its conventional roles under IT, the exchange rate could take on an additional role in alleviating inflationary pressure only under specific circumstances. The finding suggests that the impact of exchange rate management in bringing down inflation is rapid and short-lived, while the impact on output is smaller but more long-lasting than the use of interest rate policy. Thus, the use of exchange rate in curbing inflation is only appropriate in the case of temporary inflation shock. It is, however, subject to limitations. The effectiveness of exchange rate management via foreign exchange intervention, i.e. the degree of controllability, is an important concern. Moreover, prolonged intervention can also distort resource allocation and delay structural adjustments of the real economy."

It aims in particular to answer whether or not there is a role for monetary policy to contain such inflation and, if yes, how. From this study, it is found that in the past Thailand’s inflation dynamics were largely governed by temporary supply disruptions whose effects on inflation tended to quickly disappear on their own, unless assisted by some other factors such as accommodative monetary policy. During the past five years, however, the nature of these supply shocks has changed in line with the structural shifts in the demand and supply of oil and farm products. As a result, changes in oil and farm prices have themselves become more protracted. Under the circumstance, accommodative monetary policy could keep the impact of supply shocks on inflation even more lasting, and thus the inflation process could become more persistent as well. Therefore, the authorities must maintain high priority on monetary policy discipline and be mindful that persistently high inflation expectations could cause people to become inflation tolerant and ultimately allow inflation to stay high over an extended horizon."

Monetary theory and empirical evidence have provided conflicting policy recommendations regarding the role of exchange rate under inflation targeting. In theory, the objective of monetary policy could be achieved by a single policy instrument – interest rate. Exchange rate is endogenous to the change in policy rate through UIP condition and plays only subsidiary role as a channel through which the policy rate can transmit. The paper proves that, in practice, the linkage between interest rate and exchange rate is weak as evident in the failure of UIP, while exchange rate movement is found to have an important implication on output but not so much on inflation. Therefore, exchange rate may be used as another policy instrument to complement interest rate. The optimal blend between the use of interest rate and exchange rate is an important practical challenge to a small open economy under inflation targeting."

The analysis of the consumption function was based on the Life-Cycle and Permanent Income Hypotheses and used household survey data in Thailand. This empirical study found that debt positively influences consumption similar to wealth effect with greater impact of the latter. Moreover, positive debt effect can be observed in each type of consumption classified by durability, especially in durable goods. By contrast, positive wealth effect can be observed considerably on services consumption but not for durable consumption that was affected adversely from wealth. In terms of consumption classified by purpose, transportation, communication, and education spending are more heavily influenced by the positive debt effect than any other purposes. On the other hand, housheholds desire more services consumption when they become richer in line with the positive weath effect. In all, these findings are consistent with the perception that being in debt is not bad for households because it could help them finance their asset accumulation and smoothen their desired level of consumption over time. Although the study found that the current debt level is not harmful to the economy on a large scale, it is necessary to ascertain the rising household debt will not deteriorate sustainable consumption in the future. This paper proposes a set of policy recommendations to enhance the consumer credit market as well as to educate people to better manage their ability to service debt and not over-borrow. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes how important asset data is for analyzing household’s financial strength on the basis of balance sheet analysis."

It first examines the degree of financial integration and finds that East Asia is more integrated with the developed markets than with regional markets. It then proceeds to investigate the benefits of regional financial integration on economic growth. Intraregional foreign direct investment is found to have a crucial role in enlarging trade within the region. Financial integration can also lead to better allocation of funds within the region, lower risk premium and cost of capital, and financial market deepening. However, financial integration may pose higher risks on economic stability via greater volatility of capital flows which can be magnified by increasing cross-border linkages. As East Asian countries will likely be exposed to a variety of new types of risks with greater international financial integration, regional financial cooperation will have to play an important role. Strengthening regional surveillance system, establishing regional crisis prevention and resolution framework, and building domestic and regional financial infrastructure particularly for long-term regional financing are necessary for enhancing long-term macroeconomic and financial stability as well as competitiveness of the region."

Young firms tend be more efficient and invest more in physical capital and research, reflecting the importance of fluid markets and creative destruction to economic growth. The challenge for policymakers will be how to harness the forces of market competition to ensure that the firm sector, as a whole, can raise its productivity and adapt to rising competition.

Firms’ funding structures lean more towards debt funding rather than equity funding for medium and large size firms as well as those in the manufacturing sector. Information asymmetry is related to inadequate business experience and financial literacy of SMEs, and insufficient risk-based credit assessment and management. As a result, lending practice is still mostly based on collateral. The government initiatives as well as the Bank of Thailand (BOT)’s financial sector master plan have been geared toward lessening the problems. However, remaining financial gaps especially for the small firms still exist. Further roles of the BOT should focus on advocating relationship-based lending, promoting an increase in credit assessment capability of financial institutions, taking into account firms’ sizes, sectors, as well as stages of development when making credit policies, promoting and improving flows of information and financial literacy, and enhancing the evolving development of unofficial micro-finance units."

 """,2005.,Key Determinants of Liquidity in the Thai Bond Market,"2005-05, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","The Thai bond market has seen significant growth in the years following the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Authorities have recognized the importance and the need for deep and liquid bond markets and the role it plays in enhancing financial market resilience during times of stress. Markets for government securities also play an important role in providing a basis for a robust and efficient financial system as a whole. While steps have been taken to ensure that basic infrastructure in the bond market has been put in place, the lack of liquidity in the bond market has remained a major obstacle to market development. Not surprisingly, this lack of liquidity has made investors reluctant to trade bonds actively, with a large number of market players holding government bonds to maturity, in order not to incur daily mark-to-market losses. This paper identifies and analyzes the key determinants of liquidity in the Thai bond market, measured by bid-ask spreads on government bonds. We draw upon these determinants to find ways to improve liquidity in the secondary market. The paper attempts to determine what policy actions the government and central bank can take to ensure that these key determinants are achieved, providing recommendations for authorities’ role in creating an environment which best facilitates a liquid secondary market."

 """,2005.,Long-term Saving in Thailand: Are we saving enough and what are the risks?,"2005-03, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","This paper seeks to gain a better understanding of the saving process in Thailand, given its important implications on the future path of the current account, capital stock accumulation, and growth. As the current account may continue to register a deficit in the next couple of years, there will be more and more questions from policymakers on how to lessen the pressure on the current account by increasing the level of domestic saving. This paper will seek to understand the dynamics of savings at both the macro and micro levels. Using current cross-sectional data, we find pockets of under-savers at the household level, particularly households with low income and low education. We find that the fall in household savings to GDP has been due to the rise in household consumption propensity across all cohorts. We also analyze the implications of demographic trends on household savings in the medium-term. At the macro level, we find that the household savings rate partly depends on the real interest rate. Furthermore, we find that the present saving rate is not adequate for maintaining both growth and current account stability. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications. Given the increased need for saving at the macroeconomic level and the potential for households to save more, policymakers should design savings schemes focusing on households. In particular, we address how government agencies may promote more long-term saving? Among which groups? And what are the appropriate policy tools? Given the multifaceted nature of savings, an enlightened savings policy should serve to promote both macroeconomic stability and household sector welfare. Indeed, as the pressure on the current account increases in the coming years, policymakers will find that the two goals are not necessarily contradictory. Aggregate saving can be increased through targeting household saving without impinging on household welfare."

 """,2005.,Improving Financial Resilience of the Thai Economy Against Exchange Rate Risk,"2005-02, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","Excessive currency mismatch and structural fragility against FX risk not only was among the major contributing factors to the 1997 crisis, but also made the crisis very costly to resolve. Since then, the Thai economy has reduced vulnerabilities at the macro level to potential FX changes by strengthening its external positions as well as adopting a more flexible exchange rate regime. However, this is not a cause for complacency. With prospects of volatile exchange rate movement associated with existing global imbalances as well as increased importance of trade to the Thai economy, Thai firms are exposed to FX risk which could substantially impact both their income and balance sheets. This paper will first assess Thailand’s external vulnerabilities at the macro level by examining developments of various key indicators under the context of existing managed float regime. The paper will then explore current FX risk management practice at the corporate level. This part of the analysis will incorporate information from a corporate survey which was conducted to learn more on the impacts of FX risk, the methods and instruments they employ to manage the risks as well as the impediments that may prevent them from more effective hedging practices. The implications from above analysis then will be used to draw policy recommendations in order to improve country’s resilience against FX risk."

The aim of this paper is to highlight the challenges faced by the Asian region in dealing with the repercussions of unwinding global imbalances, especially in light of extensive intra-regional production-trade linkages and their dependence on US demand, as well as motivate the need for serious policy dialogue before an abrupt adjustment takes place so that policy coordination needed in dealing with the fallout can be achieved more quickly and effectively. It does so by emphasizing the inherent fragility of the current setup and, in particular, the dependence of the status quo on a particular pattern of private capital flows rather than official flows. It argues that the real role played by the latter is to help coordinate private sector expectations on a future path of the US dollar that ensures continued financing of the US current account deficit and manageable level of capital inflow into East Asia. Given the underpinnings of the situation, it becomes progressively more difficult for the official sector to serve this role effectively as time goes by and the urgency for policy initiatives to deal with the potential fallout from unwinding global imbalances becomes more pressing."

An appropriate exchange rate regime is defined to be a credible regime that is most desirable. Our findings are in agreement with the flexible exchange rate view, but not freely floating. Flexible exchange rate is associated with higher long-term growth and lower inflation on average. We find that a Fix- Flex hybrid is desirable for Thailand from the point of view of shock absorbance. The vital consideration for credibility in the medium run decides in favor of leaving much of the decisions to the market, that is more Flex than Fix. Specifically, we advocate a Fix-Flex hybrid along the line of the Adjustable Basket and Band (ABB) plus inflation targeting. This type of managed float entails a trade-based basket design that allows the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) to float within a relatively wide and adjustable band that incorporates an allowance for productivity improvement and inflation differential over time, all unannounced, combined with inflation targeting as anchor for nominal expectations."

Analyses are conducted at both aggregate and disaggregate levels. At the aggregate level, a disequilibrium econometric estimation is employed to assess the relative extent in which supply and demand factors have contributed to the credit slowdown. At the disaggregate level, the paper uses individual bank data to analyze relationship between measures of bank condition and bank lending behavior. The paper finds that availability of loanable funds and NPL overhang, both of which played a prominent role during the early stage of the contraction period, no longer appear to be major constraining factors of loan growth."

The solvency and vulnerability indicators demonstrated increasingly worsening external conditions before the crisis in 1997 but a distinct improvement has been witnessed afterwards. The steady state current account deficit calibration with the incorporation of FDI and short-term debt considerations indicates that, in the long term, Thailand’s current account deficits should not consistently exceed the rage of 2.3 to 3.3 percent of GDO. Furthermore, the results from and econometric investigation mostly confirmed the case of external debt unsustainability in the past. Assuming that the GDP gap will close up in the medium term, the future assessment points out that the current account will eventually turn negative, leading to and increase in external debt. To prevent the external debt from reaching the unsustainable level, the current account deficits should not be allowed to persistently rise above the steady state range."

Foreign Investors in the Thai Stock Market During 1994-1998,"2003-08, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","This paper investigates foreign investors’ behaviors in the Thai stock market during the late 1990s. The statistical data demonstrates the difference in trading behaviors of foreigners relative to other groups of investors. During the crisis, local investors were discouraged and their market participation fell while the foreigners remained present as net buyers. Market-timing tests reveal abilities of foreign investors in forecasting market returns, resulting in their relatively high wealth holdings compared to other investors. In addition, the information analysis suggests evidence revealing different behaviors of investors in response to publicly available new. Foreigners purchase from lacal investors in response to good news. The last set of evidence from VAR analysis implies positive feedback trading behaviors of foreign investors but recover no sign of market destabilization. Despite the fast that a fall in foreign net purchases may contribute to a decline in stock market index in the late 1996, foreign net purchases help prevent a deeper decline of the market in 1997."

The components of quarterly capital flows are used to test the sensitivity of capital flows to push and pull factors as well as liberalization and control policies. The results reveal that capital inflows are sensitive to external and domestic factors, while there is little evidence of policy effectiveness on the volume of capital flows. However, the composition of capital flows is significantly sensitive to policy implementation. The share of foreign direct investment is the most sensitive item, contradiction the previous findings that portfolio share significantly react to capital controls. The conflicting results are possibly explained by the subjectively of policy categorization and difference in the frequency of data in the estimation. The robustness check suggests that the flow in the two regions; Latin American and Asia behave differently, in which the Latin American results largely mimic the full sample estimation."

 """,2003.,Inflation dynamics and its implications for monetary policy,"2003-05, Monetary Policy Group, Bank of Thailand.","Since May 2000, the Bank of Thailand adopted inflation targeting as its monetary framework, making price stability the overriding policy objective. Understanding the inflation transmission mechanism is therefore crucial in policy assessment and decision-making. Of particular concern are the key determinants of inflation in Thailand and their relative importance over time. Given the pervasive influence of the exchange rate in the economy, the paper employs econometric models to measure the pass-through of exchange rate movements to domestic prices. In doing so, it evaluates whether the degree of pass-through varies across sectors. Reasons that explain the weak exchange rate pass-through include: 1) changes in firms’ pricing strategy, 2) lower inflation expectations, 3) shifts in housing market structure, and 4) prevalence of administered price measures. The low pass-through has provided more room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. As the pass-through depends on not only the share of import content but also the exchange rate volatility, large fluctuations in the exchange rate can still pose a threat to the inflation target."

First, given a relatively small contribution of private investment to output growth at present, will the recovery of output be anemic? And second, if private investment is crucial to sustainable output growth, what more could Thailand do to enhance private investment at this juncture? The paper is organized into three chapters. Chapter I explores the movements or cycles of output and private investment over the past few decades and assesses the importance of private investment as a contributor to output growth. Not only so, this chapter provides insights into what took place during the 1990s, focusing in particular on the deterioration of investment efficiency in the period leading up to the 1997 crisis. Chapter II investigates the various determinants of private investment, specifically, returns on investment, cost of investment, availability of financing, and the “confidence” factor. It also provides forecasts of private investment based on a range of plausible scenarios of its determinants. Finally, Chapter III offers some policy suggestions for sustainable private investment growth."

Moving on to a medium-term perspective, the paper discisses how financial structure (the degree to which the financial system is bank- or market-based) matters for long-run growth, highlighting, in particular, the problems that may arise from an over-reliance on bank-based intermediation. Finally, the paper analyzes the state of financial access in Thailand and its role in facilitating long-term growth. The central message is that the importance of financial access in sustaining growth, especially in the provinces, cannot be understated and significant room for improvement remains in this respect. The paper concludes by offering some policy recommendations that focus on tackling both the short- and long-term problems in Thailand's financial system."
