 """,2025.,Ageing and Economic Growth in China,"rdp2025-08, Reserve Bank of Australia.","China's ageing population is expected to slow the country's economic growth in coming years. Population ageing can have a negative effect on a country's growth due to the decline in the working-age population relative to the dependent population, and could cause decreased labour productivity growth, as has been the case in other countries which have experienced similar demographic shifts. This paper seeks to estimate the causal effect of ageing on GDP per capita growth in China using data among China's provinces. I find that over 10 years a 10 per cent increase in the proportion of the population aged over 60 decreases nominal GDP per capita by around 7 per cent, all other things equal. These estimates imply that an ageing population has placed downward pressure on China's economic growth in the 2010s and 2020s so far, with this pressure likely to continue in the coming years. Authorities have so far responded to this challenge by increasing retirement ages and introducing policies such as a nationwide childcare subsidy. Different sectors in the economy are not likely to be affected uniformly by population ageing. I find that an increase in the old-age ratio increases the contribution of services (excluding real estate) to output, and decreases the contribution of construction."

 """,2025.,Back to the Futures: Liquidity in Australian Bond Futures amid Market-moving Events since COVID-19,"rdp2025-07, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The market for futures on Australian Government Securities (AGS) is one of Australia's key markets for trading interest rate risk, and turnover in AGS futures is substantially greater than turnover in AGS themselves. We examine liquidity in the market for futures on AGS using granular 'tick-level' data that captures trades and changes at the top of the order book from October 2019 to June 2025. We find liquidity deteriorated at the onset of COVID-19 and around the end of the RBA's yield target. Nevertheless, the market for AGS futures functioned well in the period, with market participants always able to transact (albeit sometimes at higher transaction costs). For 'news' events in the period â€“ such as monetary policy decisions and economic data releases, which are inherently uncertain â€“ we find liquidity tended to deteriorate briefly following these events but recovered before day's end. By contrast, for 'flow' events â€“ such as pre-announced purchases and sales of AGS, including syndicated issuance â€“ we find liquidity improved in anticipation of these events and smooth trading conditions were maintained. A better understanding of how liquidity in AGS futures changes in response to market-moving events should assist AGS market participants â€“ including the RBA â€“ to extract and interpret information from market data, and to design any AGS market transactions to maximise effectiveness while minimising side effects."

 """,2025.,An AI-powered Tool for Central Bank Business Liaisons: Quantitative Indicators and On-demand Insights from Firms,"rdp2025-06, Reserve Bank of Australia.","In a world of high policy uncertainty, central banks are relying more on soft information sources to complement traditional economic statistics and model-based forecasts. One valuable source of soft information comes from intelligence gathered through central bank liaison programs â€“ structured programs in which central bank staff regularly talk with firms to gather insights. This paper introduces a new text analytics and retrieval tool that efficiently processes, organises, and analyses liaison intelligence gathered from firms using modern natural language processing techniques. The textual dataset spans around 25 years, integrates new information as soon as it becomes available, and covers a wide range of business sizes and industries. The tool uses both traditional text analysis techniques and powerful language models to provide analysts and researchers with three key capabilities: (1) quickly querying the entire history of business liaison meeting notes; (2) zooming in on particular topics to examine their frequency (topic exposure) and analysing the associated tone and uncertainty of the discussion; and (3) extracting precise numerical values from the text, such as firms' reported figures for wages and prices growth. We demonstrate how these capabilities are useful for assessing economic conditions by generating text-based indicators of wages growth and incorporating them into a nowcasting model. We find that adding these text-based features to current best-in-class predictive models, combined with the use of machine learning methods designed to handle many predictors, significantly improves the performance of nowcasts for wages growth. Predictive gains are driven by a small number of features, indicating a sparse signal in contrast to other predictive problems in macroeconomics, where the signal is typically dense."

 """,2025.,How Costly are Mark-ups in Australia? The Effect of Declining Competition on Misallocation and Productivity,"rdp2025-05, Reserve Bank of Australia.","There is substantial evidence that the degree of competition in the Australian economy has declined over the decade or so leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has the potential to weigh on productivity, and in turn incomes, and so the welfare of the Australian people. In this paper we calibrate the general equilibrium model from Edmond, Midrigan and Xu (2023) to Australian microdata to answer the following question: If the degree of competition in the Australian economy had not declined from mid-2000s levels, how much higher would aggregate productivity and GDP be due to resources being better allocated across firms throughout the economy? The answer, according to this model, is 1â€“3 per cent. The model also suggests even larger economic costs once we account for other channels through which rising mark-ups affect the economy, though these are less precisely estimated."

 """,2025.,HANK and the Transmission of Shocks to Demand and Supply,"rdp2025-04, Reserve Bank of Australia.","In this paper we study the propagation of demand and supply shocks in a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian model. Calibrating the model to Australia, we explore how inequality in the model affects shock transmission, as well as how shocks impact individuals differently across the distribution. Contrary to much of the literature, with a single asset in the model we find a dampening in the response of the real economy to a monetary policy shock, driven by falling consumption in the extremes of the distribution. This dampening is likely due to the high holdings of liquid assets by many households in the model, which allows these households to effectively smooth their consumption, emphasising the need to include further asset classes. In the case of supply shocks, we likewise find a dampened response of the real economy to both a labour disutility shock and a mark-up shock. These results highlight the need to explore models with more realistic asset classes in the Australian context."

 """,2025.,Fast Posterior Sampling in Tightly Identified SVARs Using 'Soft' Sign Restrictions,"rdp2025-03, Reserve Bank of Australia.","We propose algorithms for conducting Bayesian inference in structural vector autoregressions identified using sign restrictions. The key feature of our approach is a sampling step based on 'soft' sign restrictions. This step draws from a target density that smoothly penalises parameter values violating the restrictions, facilitating the use of computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. An importance-sampling step yields draws from the desired distribution conditional on the 'hard' sign restrictions. Relative to standard accept-reject sampling, the method substantially improves computational efficiency when identification is 'tight'. It can also greatly reduce the computational burden of implementing prior-robust Bayesian methods. We illustrate the broad applicability of the approach in a model of the global oil market identified using a rich set of sign, elasticity and narrative restrictions."

 """,2025.,Boundedly Rational Expectations and the Optimality of Flexible Average Inflation Targeting,"rdp2025-02, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Expectations play a central role in the transmission of monetary policy, but how people form expectations is widely debated. We revisit optimal monetary policy design in a model with behavioural expectations that nest rational and adaptive learning beliefs as special cases, and approximates several alternative expectations theories, such as myopic or level- k expectations. Optimal policy is a weighted average inflation target plus adjustments for belief persistence and constraints faced by the central bank (information frictions and the zero lower bound). Optimal policy is well-approximated in all cases by flexible average inflation targeting, where we make explicit what average and flexible mean."

 """,2025.,Are Investment Tax Breaks Effective? Australian Evidence,"rdp2025-01, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Using Australian tax and survey data, we exploit discrete eligibility cut-offs to estimate the effect of several business investment tax breaks, including tax credits and instant asset write-offs, implemented over the past 15 years. Policies implemented during the global financial crisis increased investment. Responses are larger for unincorporated businesses, possibly reflecting reduced efficacy of investment stimulus under Australia's dividend imputation system. However, we find mostly no evidence of an effect for other investment policies, including those implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic."

 """,2024.,How Do Global Shocks Affect Australia?,"rdp2024-10, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Foreign or global economic and financial shocks can be significant drivers of economic outcomes in small open economies such as Australia, and are therefore a considerable source of uncertainty to the Australian economic outlook. Examining the extent to which global shocks affect the Australian financial system and economy and the channels through which these shocks operated over the 1990â€“2019 period, we find that global shocks drive considerable variation in the exchange rate and the cash rate, but a smaller proportion of variation in economic variables like real GDP. This suggests that, over our sample, the exchange rate and domestic monetary policy have effectively buffered the Australian economy from global shocks. Unlike some other recent literature on global spillovers, we do not find the Australian banking system to be a substantial channel of financial and economic spillovers to Australia."

 """,2024.,The 'Clean Energy Transition' and the Cost of Job Displacement in Energy-intensive Industries,"rdp2024-09, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the costs of job displacement in energy-intensive industries in selected OECD countries. Based on harmonised linked employer-employee data from 14 OECD countries, we estimate the effect of job displacement in three energy-intensive industries, namely energy supply, heavy manufacturing and transport, compared to other industries. We find that workers displaced from energy supply and heavy manufacturing, experience larger earnings losses compared with workers in non-energy-intensive and transport sectors. Larger earnings losses mainly result from weaker re-employment outcomes in terms of wages and job instability but also challenges with finding another job. They reflect significant differences in the composition of workers and firms in energy supply and heavy manufacturing and the rest of the economy. Displaced workers in these sectors tend to be older, are less skilled and more likely to be previously employed in high-wage firms."

 """,2024.,Modelling Reserve Demand with Deposits and the Cost of Collateral,"rdp2024-08, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The RBA controls short-term interest rates by offering to lend as many reserves as banks demand at a rate close to its target for monetary policy. At this rate, banks' demand drives the amount of reserves the RBA supplies and subsequently the size of its balance sheet. I estimate a substantial increase in Australian banks' reserve demand since the COVID-19 pandemic. I find an increase in banking system deposits explains a large part of the increase in reserve demand through an associated shift to the right in Australian banks' reserve demand curve. The link between deposits and reserve demand suggests banks are willing to pay for the convenience of holding additional reserves to manage payments between depositors, or that banks hold reserves against deposits as a precaution in case of liquidity stress. The value of collateral also shifts banks' reserve demand curve as it changes the price at which banks can fund reserves through the repo market. The role of collateral in explaining the increase in banks' reserve demand is likely small as its value is little changed since the pandemic."

 """,2024.,How Do Households Form Inflation and Wage Expectations?,"rdp2024-07, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper explores the formation of households' wage and inflation expectations using a common dataset and framework, documenting a number of stylised facts. We find that households tend to form wage and inflation expectations somewhat differently. Households associate higher wages growth with good economic outcomes, but higher inflation with worse economic outcomes. Wages expectations also tend to be somewhat more forward looking, while inflation expectations are more backward looking, especially for lower income households, and place a disproportionate weight on past fuel prices. These findings paint a picture of households having a somewhat 'supply-side' view of inflation, where shocks that push up inflation also weaken the economy, but a more 'demand-side' view of wages, where shocks that push up wages also strengthen the economy, which may make communication of monetary policy and the outlook more challenging."

 """,2024.,Examining the Macroeconomic Costs of Occupational Entry Regulations,"rdp2024-06, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Occupational entry regulations (OER) are legal requirements that people need to meet to enter certain professions. They are intended to protect consumers by ensuring providers are of sufficient quality â€“ but they can also create costs by making it harder for new workers to enter a profession or for new firms to open and grow. In this paper we construct a database of OER stringency across three states and a number of occupations to better understand these potential costs. We find that for services provided to consumers (businesses), OER tend to be more (less) stringent in Australia compared with the average OECD country. In most occupations OER are more stringent in Australia compared to the least stringent OECD country. We find that more stringent OER are associated with lower business entry and exit rates, and a slower flow of workers from less to more productive firms, both of which may have negative implications for productivity. We also find some tentative evidence that OER tend to be associated with skill shortages. These results do not necessarily suggest that OER should be less stringent. But they fill a gap in our understanding of the effects of OER, which can help policymakers going forward."

 """,2024.,Sign Restrictions and Supply-demand Decompositions of Inflation,"rdp2024-05, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Policymakers are often interested in the degree to which changes in prices are driven by shocks to supply or demand. One way to estimate the contributions of these shocks is with a structural vector autoregression identified using sign restrictions on the slopes of demand and supply curves. The appeal of this approach is that it relies on uncontroversial assumptions. However, sign restrictions only identify decompositions up to a set. I characterise the conditions under which these sets are informative, examining both historical decompositions (contributions to outcomes) and forecast error variance decompositions (contributions to variances). I use this framework to estimate the contributions of supply and demand shocks to inflation in the United States. While the sign restrictions yield sharp conclusions about the drivers of inflation in some expenditure categories, they tend to yield uninformative decompositions of aggregate inflation. A 'bottom-up' decomposition of aggregate inflation is less informative than a decomposition that uses the aggregate data directly."

 """,2024.,Nowcasting Quarterly GDP Growth during the COVID-19 Crisis Using a Monthly Activity Indicator,"rdp2024-04, Reserve Bank of Australia.","What is happening now? The onset of the COVID-19 crisis highlighted the importance of having timely data on the economy to help policymakers make more informed decisions. However, the most comprehensive measure of activity, GDP, is published with a long lag, thereby limiting its value to policymakers as a measure of the current state of the economy. To overcome this information deficiency, we develop a monthly activity indicator (MAI) for Australia. The MAI aims to provide policymakers with a more immediate snapshot of prevailing economic conditions. We achieve this by using a dynamic factor model to summarise the information content from a curated list of 30 monthly predictors selected for their ability to explain movements in quarterly real GDP growth. We undertake a pseudo out-of-sample nowcasting exercise using the MAI in an unrestricted MIDAS model and find that nowcasts based on the MAI significantly outperform standard benchmarks. Crucially, outperformance is largest during the COVID-19 crisis, emphasising the benefit from considering monthly data. Our results demonstrate that the MAI is a useful tool for policymakers to gain a better understanding of current economic conditions in Australia."

 """,2024.,Demand in the Repo Market: Indirect Perspectives from Open Market Operations from 2006 to 2020,"rdp2024-03, Reserve Bank of Australia.","In Australia repurchase (repo) obligations are traded bilaterally 'over-the-counter' between parties, rather than on an exchange. As a result, it is difficult to obtain quotes of executable prices, trading volumes, and related data that are representative of the market. Market conditions are therefore not easy to assess and often dependent on anecdotal evidence. Over the years, the Reserve Bank of Australia has published data and analysis of the repo market by providing indirect perspectives using data from its own open market operations that are conducted using repos. This paper contributes to this work. The Reserve Bank conducts open market operations to manage liquidity in the interbank market, provide settlement balances for the smooth functioning of the payments system, and for the implementation of monetary policy. Repos are an integral part of these operations. The eligible private sector counterparties in these auctions have a variety of reasons for participating. We arrange their bids in an ascending order in a number of distinct phases so that they can be used to make inferences about the demand for repo and hence market operations. Several insights allow us to better understand the dynamics underpinning the repo market. The findings mainly relate to the period prior to the implementation of unconventional monetary policies in March 2020."

 """,2024.,Valuing Safety and Privacy in Retail Central Bank Digital Currency,"rdp2024-02, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper explores the merits of introducing a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) in Australia, focusing on the extent to which consumers would value having access to a digital form of money that is even safer and potentially more private than commercial bank deposits. To conduct our exploration we run a discrete choice experiment, which is a technique designed specifically for assessing public valuations of goods without markets. The results suggest that the average consumer attaches no value to the added safety of a CBDC. This is consistent with bank deposits in Australia already being perceived as a safe form of money, and physical cash issued by the Reserve Bank of Australia continuing to be available as an alternative option. Privacy settings of a CBDC, which can take various forms, look more consequential for the CBDC value proposition. We find no clear relationship between safety or privacy valuations and the degree of consumers' cash use."

 """,2024.,Do Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions Impact Innovation? Evidence from Australian Administrative Data,"rdp2024-01, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Recent papers have argued that monetary policy and economic conditions can influence the amount of innovative activity in the economy, and therefore productivity and living standards in the future. This paper examines whether this is the case for Australia, a small open economy that tends to import innovation from overseas. We find that contractionary (expansionary) monetary policy reduces (increases) aggregate research and development (R&D) spending, and that lower (higher) R&D spending reduces (increases) future productivity. However, using firm-level data and a broader survey measure of innovation that also captures adoption, we find heterogeneous responses across different firm types. Small firms decrease innovation in response to contractionary monetary policy shocks whereas large firms increase innovation. This heterogeneity appears to reflect differing exposure to the channels through which monetary policy affects innovation. These channels include affecting demand or affecting financial conditions and constraints. We also find that US monetary policy spills over and affects Australian firms' innovation. Overall, our results suggest that monetary policy and economic conditions have medium-run effects on productivity, though the effects are more heterogeneous than previously documented. While the effects may cancel out over a cycle, this finding highlights the importance of stabilisation policy in preventing medium-run economic scarring."

 """,2023.,Adoption of Emerging Digital General-purpose Technologies: Determinants and Effects,"rdp2023-10, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper examines the factors associated with the adoption of cloud computing and artificial intelligence/machine learning, two emerging digital general-purpose technologies (GPT), as well as firms' post-adoption outcomes. To do so we identify adoption of GPT based on references to these technologies in listed company reports, and merge this with data on their Board of Directors, their hiring activities and their financial performance. We find that firms that have directors with relevant technological backgrounds, or female representation on their Board, are more likely to profitably adopt GPT, with the former being particularly important. Worker skills also appear important, with firms that adopt GPT, particularly those that do so profitably, being more likely to hire skilled staff following adoption. Finally, while early adopters of GPT experience a dip in profitability following adoption, this is not evident for more recent adopters. This suggests that GPT may have become easier to adopt over time, potentially due to changes in the technologies or the availability of relevant skills, which is encouraging in terms of future productivity outcomes."

 """,2023.,Does Monetary Policy Affect Non-mining Business Investment in Australia? Evidence from BLADE,"rdp2023-09, Reserve Bank of Australia.","We provide new evidence on the effect of monetary policy on investment in Australia using firm-level data. We find that contractionary monetary policy makes firms less likely to invest and lowers the amount they invest if they do so. The effects are similar for young and old firms, indicating that the decline in the number of young firms in Australia over time is unlikely to have weakened the effect of monetary policy. The effects are also broadly similar for smaller and larger firms. This suggests that evidence that some, particularly large, firms have sticky hurdle rates does not mean that they do not respond to monetary policy. It also suggests that overseas findings that expansionary monetary policy lessens competition by supporting the largest firms likely do not apply to Australia. We find evidence that financially constrained firms, and sectors that are more dependent on external finance, are more responsive to monetary policy, highlighting the important role of cash flow and financing constraints in the transmission of monetary policy. Finally, we find evidence that monetary policy affects firms' actual and expected investment contemporaneously, suggesting that expectations are reactive and will tend to lag over the cycle."

 """,2023.,The Evolution of Consumer Payments in Australia: Results from the 2022 Consumer Payments Survey,"rdp2023-08, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The Reserve Bank conducted its sixth triennial Consumer Payments Survey (CPS), which provides detailed information on how Australians make their payments. The 2022 CPS provides the first comprehensive snapshot of consumer payment behaviour following the changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey shows that most in-person payments are made by tapping cards or mobile devices, even for small purchases. This means the share of in-person transactions made with cash halved, from 32 per cent to 16 per cent, over the three years to 2022. The demographic groups that traditionally used cash more frequently for payments â€“ such as the elderly, those on lower incomes and those in regional areas â€“ saw the largest declines in cash use. Cash usage has generally been replaced with card payments. While Australians are aware of and use a range of other newer payment methods, such as digital wallets and buy now, pay later services, they still make up a small share of payments."

 """,2023.,Identification and Inference under Narrative Restrictions,"rdp2023-07, Reserve Bank of Australia.","We consider structural vector autoregressions subject to narrative restrictions, which are inequalities involving structural shocks in specific time periods (e.g. shock signs in given quarters). Narrative restrictions are used widely in the empirical literature. However, under these restrictions, there are no formal results on identification or the properties of frequentist approaches to inference, and existing Bayesian methods can be sensitive to prior choice. We provide formal results on identification, propose a computationally tractable robust Bayesian method that eliminates prior sensitivity, and show that it is asymptotically valid from a frequentist perspective. Using our method, we find that inferences about the output effects of US monetary policy obtained under restrictions related to the Volker episode are sensitive to prior choice. Under a richer set of restrictions, there is robust evidence that output falls following a positive monetary policy shock."

 """,2023.,Firms' Price-setting Behaviour: Insights from Earnings Calls,"rdp2023-06, Reserve Bank of Australia.","We introduce new firm-level indices covering input costs, demand and final prices based on listed Australian firms' earnings calls going back to 2007. These indices are constructed using a powerful transformer-based large language model. We show the new indices track current economic conditions, consistent with a simple conceptual framework we use to explain why there is real-time information in firms' earnings calls. Focusing on firms' price-setting behaviour, the reduced-form associations we estimate appear to show that discussions around final prices have become more sensitive to import costs but less sensitive to labour costs in the period since 2021. This is after controlling for changes in the operating environment that are common to all firms, including global supply shocks. Firms' price-setting sentiment also appears more sensitive to rising input costs compared to falling costs, suggesting that prices could remain front-of-mind for company executives even as supply pressures ease."

 """,2023.,The Impact of Interest Rates on Bank Profitability: A Retrospective Assessment Using New Cross-country Bank-level Data,"rdp2023-05, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper provides a retrospective assessment of the relationship between bank profitability and interest rates, focusing on the period when rates were very low or negative. To do this we use new confidential bank-level data covering about 1,500 banks operating in 10 banking systems, with most samples spanning the two decades up to the end of 2019. Our analysis confirms the empirical regularity that declining interest rates reduce banks' net interest margins. However, we find a smaller effect than in previous studies: on average across countries, a 100 basis point fall in short-term interest rates results in a 5 basis point decline in net interest margins in the short run. Notably, there are substantial cross-country differences, and, in some cases, the estimated effect is greater. Importantly, the effect of lower interest rates on net interest margins is larger than the effect on assets returns, suggesting that banks can shield overall profitability in the face of lower interest rates. For example, lower interest rates alleviate debt-servicing burdens and are associated with a fall in provisions set aside to cover losses on loans. There is therefore no one-size-fits-all result for the impact of low interest rates on overall profitability: in some jurisdictions banks maintained their level of profitability as the beneficial impact of lower rates on loan-loss provisions and other factors, including an increased focus on cost efficiencies and streamlining business models, materially offset the drag from lower interest margins."

 """,2023.,Can We Use High-frequency Yield Data to Better Understand the Effects of Monetary Policy and Its Communication? Yes and No!,"rdp2023-04, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Understanding the effects of monetary policy and its communication is crucial for a central bank. This paper explores a new approach to identifying the effects of monetary policy using high-frequency data around monetary policy decisions and other announcements that allows us to explore different facets of monetary policy, specifically: current policy action; signalling or forward guidance about future rates; and the effect on uncertainty and term premia. The approach provides an intuitive lens through which to understand how policy and its communication affected expectations for rates and risks during certain historical periods, and more generally. For example, it suggests that: (i) signalling/forward guidance shocks tended to raise expected future policy rates in the mid-2010s as the RBA highlighted rising risks in housing markets; (ii) COVID-19-era monetary policy worked mainly through affecting term premia rather than expectations for future policy rates, unlike pre-COVID-19 policy; and (iii) shocks to the expected path of rates are predictable based on data available at the time, which suggests that markets systematically misunderstand how the RBA reacts to data, highlighting the importance of clear communication. We also explore the macroeconomic effects of these different shocks. The effects of shocks to current policy are similar to those estimated in previous papers, and existing issues such as the 'price puzzle' remain, while the effects of other shocks are imprecisely estimated. Although the approach provides little new information on the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy, it does highlight the importance of these other facets of policy in moving interest rates and suggests additional work in this space could be valuable."

 """,2023.,"Doing Less, with Less: Capital Misallocation, Investment and the Productivity Slowdown in Australia","rdp2023-03, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Productivity growth has slowed in Australia in recent decades. Previous research highlighted the roles of persistently weak non-mining investment and a pervasive decline in economic dynamism, including slower reallocation of labour from low- to high-productivity firms. While these facts have so far been considered separately, this paper attempts to connect them by documenting investment patterns for firms with different levels of productivity. We find that more productive firms are more likely to invest and expand their capital stock than less productive firms, but the extent to which this is true has declined over time. This has weighed on productivity, output and incomes through lower aggregate investment, and also through a less efficient allocation of that investment. We find evidence that capital reallocation slowed more in sectors that were more dependent on external finance, pointing to financing frictions as potentially playing a role. Declines have also been more pronounced in sectors with increasing mark-ups, suggesting that weaker competition may have blunted incentives for firms to expand and improve or exit."

 """,2023.,Did Labour Market Concentration Lower Wages Growth Pre-COVID?,"rdp2023-02, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Wages growth in Australia was lower than expected prior to COVID-19 based on historical determinants. One possible explanation for this is that employment had become more concentrated among a small number of large employers. This reduced outside options for workers and lowered their bargaining power and wages. This paper examines concentration in Australian labour markets and its impacts on wages using a large and representative database derived from administrative tax data. Labour markets have not, on average, become more concentrated over time. However, the impact of any given level of concentration has increased since the 2010s. This may help explain surprisingly low wages growth pre-COVID, despite labour market concentration having remained constant. Simple back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that the greater impact of concentration may have lowered wages by a little under 1 per cent on average between 2011 and 2015. Declining firm entry and dynamism appear to have contributed to the increased impact of concentration, and lower wages growth, by lowering competition for labour among incumbent firms. Declining union coverage and occupational mobility may also have played a role, but declining firm entry appears to have been the main driver."

 """,2023.,The Effect of Credit Constraints on Housing Prices: (Further) Evidence from a Survey Experiment,"rdp2023-01, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The response of housing prices to financing conditions is determined by the effect on the marginal buyer, not the average household. I use heterogeneous willingness to pay (WTP) data from a stated preference experiment in Fuster and Zafar (2021) to estimate the effects of changes in mortgage rates and collateral constraints on housing prices by analysing the structure of housing demand curves. This work builds on their research, which focused on average changes in WTP. Relaxing down payment constraints has a large average effect on WTP, but the effect on price is less than half as large. Financially constrained households tend to respond more to relaxed constraints, but those households often have WTPs that are too low to affect market prices. Changing the mortgage rate has the same average effect on WTPs and on market prices, because there is no systematic relationship between a household's response to mortgage rates and their location on the demand curve. I use a heterogeneous user cost model of individual WTPs to understand how household heterogeneity determines the structure of overall housing demand. An empirical model using observable household characteristics allows the experimental findings to be applied to other household survey data to simulate the effects of credit conditions. The simulated effects of easing collateral constraints in Australia are fairly stable over the past 20 years, and show a similar pattern to the US results."

 """,2022.,Estimating the Effects of Monetary Policy in Australia Using Sign-restricted Structural Vector Autoregressions,"rdp2022-09, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Existing estimates of the macroeconomic effects of Australian monetary policy tend to be based on strong, potentially contentious, assumptions. I estimate these effects under weaker assumptions. Specifically, I estimate a structural vector autoregression identified using a variety of sign restrictions, including restrictions on impulse responses to a monetary policy shock, the monetary policy reaction function, and the relationship between the monetary policy shock and a proxy for this shock. I use an approach to Bayesian inference that accounts for the problem of posterior sensitivity to the choice of prior that arises in this setting, which turns out to be important. Some sets of identifying restrictions are not particularly informative about the effects of monetary policy. However, combining the restrictions allows us to draw some useful inferences. There is robust evidence that an increase in the cash rate lowers output and consumer prices at horizons beyond a year or so. The results are consistent with the macroeconomic effects of a 100 basis point increase in the cash rate lying towards the upper end of the range of existing estimates."

In this paper, I explore how this international literature relates to the Australian banking sector, which operates differently to other jurisdictions. In the face of low rates, the profitability of Australian banks has likely been less adversely affected than what the international literature would predict, but the flip side to this is that the pass-through of monetary policy to lending rates may have been more muted. I then use a recent advance in macrofinancial modelling to explore whether pass-through in Australia could turn negative â€“ the so called 'reversal rate' â€“ and find that the features of the Australian banking system mean a reversal rate is highly unlikely to exist in Australia."

It achieved a key objective of providing banks with three-year low-cost funding and was available for drawdown until 30 June 2021. This paper examines the effectiveness of the TFF in increasing the supply of credit to businesses, which was another one of the objectives of the program. Using bank-level data and a difference-in-differences approach, we find no statistically significant evidence that the TFF increased credit supply to businesses. However, our confidence intervals are wide and there are significant identification challenges involved in disentangling the effects of the TFF from the effects of pandemic-related disruptions and other policy interventions on credit supply and demand. Nonetheless, the TFF provided an assured source of funding at a time of considerable stress in the financial system and lowered banks' funding costs, and any effects on business lending via these channels may not be fully reflected in our results."

I find that middle-income households without liquidity and credit constraints tend to borrow more for non-residential investment purposes as local income inequality rises, suggesting that they are trying to close the income gap. They also appear to try to close the consumption gap by accumulating more car debt with a rise in local income inequality. Both findings are consistent with households 'keeping up with the Joneses', but unlikely to have implications for macrofinancial stability given that households taking on debt appear well resourced."

I find that exposure to debt covenants disciplines firms' investment and staff expenses even in the absence of covenant breaches. In addition, covenants with interest coverage limits appear to amplify the transmission of monetary policy shocks while other types of covenants appear to mitigate transmission. As such, the shift from interest coverage limits to other types of covenants that appears to have occurred since the late 2000s may have lowered the responsiveness of investment to monetary policy, and in turn accounted for some of the surprising weakness in non-mining investment over the past decade."

However, answering questions of economic interest often requires knowing the effects of a 'unit' shock. For example, central bankers want to answer questions like 'what are the effects of a 100 basis point increase in the policy rate?' The problem is that set-identifying restrictions do not always rule out the possibility that a variable does not react contemporaneously to its own shock. As a consequence, identified sets for the impulse responses to unit shocks may be unbounded, which implies that set-identifying restrictions may be extremely uninformative. Simply assuming that responses are non-zero turns out to be an arbitrary and unsatisfactory solution. I argue that it is therefore important to communicate about the extent to which the identified set may be unbounded, since this tells us about the informativeness of the identifying restrictions, and I develop tools to facilitate this. I explain how to draw useful posterior inferences about impulse responses when identified sets are unbounded with positive probability. I illustrate the empirical relevance of these issues by estimating the response of US output to a 100 basis point federal funds rate shock under different sets of identifying restrictions. Some restrictions are very uninformative about the effects of a 100 basis point shock. The output responses I obtain under a rich set of identifying restrictions lie towards the smaller end of the range of existing estimates."

It is designed with a focus on understanding systemic vulnerabilities and a philosophy of prioritising transparency over complexity. The key advantages of this model are its ability to quickly produce estimates of the capital loss in response to various macroeconomic scenarios, model various forms of contagion across banks, and allow the modeller to undertake 'reverse' stress tests.

We also assess the impact of the three measures on government bond market functioning. The three measures were: purchases to support government bond market function over early 2020; the yield target on 3-year Australian government bonds; and the bond purchase program to lower longer-term yields from late 2020 until early 2022. For purchases to support market function, we find that the announcement lowered short-dated Australian Government Securities (AGS) yields, but did not lower longer-dated AGS yields. We also find that such purchases led to lower yields as and when they were implemented, and that they supported market function by lowering bid-offer spreads. For the yield target, we find a substantial announcement effect and moderate implementation effects on yields. Conversely, the yield target appears to have detrimentally affected some aspects of government bond market function. For the bond purchase program, we find an announcement effect of around 30 basis points for longer-term AGS yields, while any implementation effects were small and temporary."

How this banking sector interacts with the rest of the economy chiefly depends on the extent of loan losses. During small downturns, losses are absorbed by banks' profits and the resulting effect on the broader economy is limited to that caused by the lower shareholder returns (which is already part of MARTIN). During large downturns, loan losses reduce banks' capital, and banks respond by reducing their credit supply. This reduction in supply reduces housing prices, wealth and investment; thereby amplifying the downturn (which leads to further losses). Our state-dependent approach is a significant advance on the treatment of financial sectors within existing macroeconometric models. Having a banking sector in MARTIN allows us to explore important policy questions. In this paper, we show how the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on the state of the economy. During large downturns, monetary policy is more effective than usual because it can reduce loan losses and therefore moderate any reduction in credit supply. But at low interest rates, the zero lower bound on retail deposit interest rates reduces policy effectiveness. We also investigate how one of the more pessimistic economic scenarios that could have resulted from COVID-19 might have affected the banking sector, and subsequently amplified the resulting downturn."

Using text analysis, I construct a new company-level indicator of sentiment based on the net balance of positive and negative words in Australian company disclosures. I find that company-level investment is very sensitive to changes in this corporate sentiment indicator, even controlling for fundamentals, such as Tobin's Q and expected profits, as well as controlling for measures of company-level uncertainty. I explore the mechanisms that link investment to sentiment. The conditional relationship could be because sentiment proxies for private information held by managers about the future prospects of the company or because of animal spirits among managers relative to investors. I find that the effect of sentiment on investment is relatively persistent, which is consistent with the private information story, albeit less persistent than other news shocks, such as Tobin's Q. But the effect of sentiment on investment is not any stronger at 'opaque' companies in which managers are likely to be better informed than investors, which argues against the private information story. Corporate investment has been weak in Australia since the global financial crisis (GFC) and demand-side factors, such as lower sales growth, explain more than half of this persistent weakness. Low sentiment and heightened uncertainty weighed on investment during the GFC but have been less important factors since then."

We document a less well-known phenomenon: household liquid assets (such as cash, deposits and equities) have also risen strongly relative to income over the same period. This is true for Australia and for most advanced economies. We explore the determinants of liquidity across households and over time, using a range of household surveys for Australia. We find that household liquidity is strongly associated with life cycle factors, such as age and housing tenure. The increase in liquidity over recent decades has been broad based across households, though strongest amongst those with mortgage debt. Consistent with this, the share of liquidity-constrained households has declined significantly. The growth in liquidity is closely connected to developments in the housing market. First, higher housing prices have lifted the deposit requirement for potential home buyers, encouraging such households to save more in liquid assets. Second, higher mortgage debt has increased the repayment risks associated with future income declines, leading indebted home owners to save more for precautionary reasons, partly through paying down debt ahead of schedule. The process of building wealth and liquidity through debt amortisation has been supported by the trend decline in interest rates and unique financial innovations such as mortgage offset and redraw accounts that have made housing wealth more liquid. Overall, the rise in household liquidity appears to have increased the financial resilience of the household sector."

To help fill this gap, we study data on unemployment rates and wages growth across local labour markets over the past 20 years. The considerable variation in economic conditions across local labour markets allows us to infer the strength of the relationship between unemployment and wages growth (i.e. the wage Phillips curve) at very low unemployment rates that are rarely seen at the national level. We find strong evidence that the wage Phillips curve is indeed a curve, rather than a straight line. When the unemployment rate exceeds 7Â½ per cent, the Phillips curve is flat and wages growth is unresponsive to changes in unemployment. Wages growth then becomes increasingly responsive to changes in the unemployment rate as the unemployment rate falls to lower and lower levels, most notably below 4 per cent. These findings have implications for monetary policy, particularly at the current juncture given the Reserve Bank of Australia's central forecast for the unemployment rate to fall to multi-decade lows in the next few years."

However, they typically overpredict the probability of job loss, particularly during economic downturns. The unemployed typically underestimate how long they will be unemployed for. We link these insights on worker expectations of future job prospects to household spending decisions at unemployment. At unemployment, households reduce total spending by around 9 per cent on average. Workhorse consumption models, such as those based on the permanent income hypothesis, predict that households should reduce spending by more in response to unexpected job loss events than to expected ones. Contrary to this, we find that households reduce spending by similar amounts regardless of whether they expect job loss or not. We also find some evidence that the spending response is larger for households that are liquidity constrained, and for households that have been unemployed for longer."

With prudential bank-level panel data, we empirically identify banks' credit supply and interest rate responses and test for other effects of these policies. The policies quickly reduced growth in the targeted type of credit while total mortgage growth remained steady. Banks met the limits by raising interest rates on targeted mortgage products and this lifted their income temporarily. The largest banks substituted into non-targeted mortgage products while smaller banks did not. Practical implementation difficulties slowed effects of the (first) investor policy, and led to some disproportionate bank responses, but had largely been overcome by the time the (second) IO policy was implemented."

A Survey of High School Students,"rdp2021-06, Reserve Bank of Australia.","There has been a stark decline in the size and diversity of the Year 12 Economics student population in Australia since the early 1990s. This paper addresses 3 key questions to uncover what is driving these trends at Australia's high schools. First, which school and individual characteristics are most strongly associated with choosing Economics? Second, what are students' perceptions of Economics? And third, what differences in perceptions of Economics exist by sex and socio-economic background? We utilise unit record data from a Reserve Bank of Australia commissioned survey of over 4,800 students in Years 10 to 12 (15 to 18 year olds) and administrative school-level data on high schools in New South Wales. The RBA-led survey provides a unique primary source of data on high school students' perceptions of Economics that is novel to the Australian and international literature. We find that high school students typically have positive perceptions of economics as a field; however, the perceptions of Economics as a subject tend to be negative. Males and students from a higher socio-economic background have more favourable perceptions of Economics than other students, which is reflected in a higher likelihood of them choosing to study Economics. Controlling for a greater perceived understanding of what Economics is about does appear to reduce some of the sex and socio-economic differences in perceptions, but a gap remains. In particular, it remains that females have less interest in Economics and a less clear idea of 'whether they would be good at it' or what the subsequent career opportunities may be. Furthermore, students from a lower socio-economic background are less likely to feel 'they could do well in Economics if they put their mind to it', and less likely to report that teachers at their school promote the study of Economics. And both females and students from a lower socio-economic background are more likely to believe that 'it is a risk to study Economics because I don't know what it's about', and have more favourable perceptions of Business Studies. The results shed light on the scope for interventions to promote participation and diversity in the study of Economics."

There is, however, no agreement on what high-quality communication looks like. To shed light on this, we investigate 3 important aspects of central bank communication. We focus on how different audiences perceive the readability and degree of reasoning within various economic publications; providing the reasons for decisions is a critical element of transparency. We find that there is little correlation between perceived readability and reasoning in the economic communications we analyse, which highlights that commonly used measures of readability can miss important aspects of communication. We also find that perceptions of communication quality can vary significantly between audiences; one size does not fit all. To dig deeper we use machine learning techniques and develop a model that predicts the way different audiences rate the readability of and reasoning within texts. The model highlights that simpler writing is not necessarily more readable nor more revealing of the author's reasoning. The results also show how readability and reasoning vary within and across documents; good communication requires a variety of styles within a document, each serving a different purpose, and different audiences need different styles. Greater central bank transparency and more effective communication require an emphasis not just on greater readability of a single document, but also on setting out the reasoning behind conclusions in a variety of documents that each meet the needs of different audiences."

So, could changes in monetary policy reveal some additional information about the economic outlook to the public? This channel is known as the 'information effect'. The information effect posits that, in addition to the usual effects of monetary policy, agents interpret an interest rate increase as signalling some additional positive economic information. This effect, if strong enough, could then lead to dynamics where an increase in interest rates causes an expansion in economic activity. I evaluate whether the information effect can be detected in Australia through the lens of equity markets. I find that, contrary to the predictions of the information effect, a surprise monetary tightening from a monetary policy announcement causes equity prices to fall. I also show that this response in equity prices is, at least in part, driven by downward adjustments in expected earnings growth. These responses are consistent with conventional views of the effects of monetary policy. However, looking beyond monetary policy announcements yields some evidence that an information effect could be present through other forms of Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) communication. I find speeches delivered by the RBA Governor generate responses in equity prices and earnings forecasts consistent with the information effect. But this result appears to be the exception rather than the rule. For most monetary policy communication, at least in equity markets, the information effect is not an important channel of monetary policy."

We find that more restrictive financial conditions play an important role in explaining downside risk to growth in both GDP and employment and upside risk to changes in the unemployment rate. Our measure of financial conditions is, however, less useful for explaining risks to growth in household consumption and business investment. Overall, the framework provides a useful characterisation of the relationship between financial stability and economic activity in Australia."

After the exogenous shock, collateralised and uncollateralised borrowing compositions diverge. Uncollateralised borrowing declines for ex ante riskier borrowers while collateralised borrowing increases for borrowers ex ante holding more high-quality collateral. Moreover, riskier banks with sufficient high-quality collateral substitute from uncollateralised to collateralised borrowing. In aggregate, collateralised borrowing expands substantially, predominantly collateralised against second-best (but still high quality) collateral, while interest rates on loans against first-best collateral fall substantially, indicating scarcity of the most-liquid safe assets. This liquid asset demand encourages collateralised lending, contrary to cash hoarding."

The COVID-19 pandemic is the most recent example of a crisis where events with little historical precedent played out rapidly and unpredictably. To address this need for real-time indicators we develop a new indicator of 'news sentiment' based on a combination of text analysis, machine learning and newspaper articles. The news sentiment index complements other timely economic indicators and has the advantage of potentially being updated on a daily basis. It captures key macroeconomic events, such as economic downturns, and typically moves ahead of survey-based measures of sentiment. Changes in sentiment expressed in monetary policy-related news can also partly explain unexpected changes in monetary policy. This suggests that news captures important, but unobserved, information about the risks to the RBA's forecasts that the RBA responds to when setting interest rates.

We find that one in five employees who received JobKeeper (and, thus, remained employed) would not have remained employed during this period had it not been for the JobKeeper Payment. Given that 3½ million individuals were receiving the payment over the period from April to July 2020, this implies that JobKeeper reduced total employment losses by at least 700,000 over the same period. We discuss the potential sources of bias that might affect our results, some of which stem from the fact that our conclusions are based on a sample of casual employees who may have responded differently to JobKeeper than other workers.

The 2019 CPS was conducted just before the emergence of COVID-19 in Australia and gives a detailed snapshot of consumer payment behaviour prior to the changes in spending patterns induced by the pandemic. The survey provided further evidence that Australian consumers increasingly prefer to use electronic payment methods rather than cash for their day-to-day payments. Many people now tap their cards (or sometimes phones) even for small purchases. When paying with a card in person or online, consumers are more often choosing to use a debit card rather than a credit card. As a result, debit cards were the most frequently used consumer payment method in the 2019 survey. Consumers are also increasingly taking advantage of the ability to make payments using a range of innovative new payment services that have emerged in recent years, often facilitated by mobile technology and the use of digital payment credentials. Despite the trend towards electronic payments, cash still accounted for a significant share of lower-value payments and a material proportion of the population continue to make many of their payments in cash."

It is commonly cited as a major risk to numerous countries, including Australia. We consider how much risk this debt poses to Australia by asking three questions: (i) what accounts for the rise in household debt-to-income ratios and its level in Australia relative to other countries?; (ii) what losses might the Australian banking system suffer from these exposures in the event of a severe stress?; and (iii) how does household debt affect the sensitivity of consumption in Australia to severe economic shocks? Our results suggest that risks arising from Australian household indebtedness are more subtle than sometimes conveyed. In particular: fundamental factors (higher real incomes, a fall in nominal interest rates, financial liberalisation and household ownership of the rental stock) mostly account for the current level of household debt; banks appear resilient to a severe downturn thanks to moderate loan-to-valuation ratios on residential mortgages; and the distribution of debt does not appear to heighten wealth effects on consumption. However, there are risks. Our model cannot account for the increase in debt over the past four or five years. In addition, we demonstrate that a large but plausible fall in asset prices could lead to a substantial fall in consumption and that the increase in indebtedness over the past decade has slightly increased the potential loss of consumption during periods of financial stress."

There are smaller gaps of $97,000 (20 per cent of costs) in Melbourne and $10,000 (2 per cent of costs) in Brisbane. The large gaps are sustained by planning restrictions.

But other factors are important too. Specifically, we find the sensitivity is greater in areas where incomes are relatively high, households are more indebted and there are more investors. Taken together, this suggests that the state of the economy can affect the sensitivity of housing prices to monetary policy. We also directly explore how monetary policy affects housing wealth inequality. We find that housing prices in more expensive areas are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than in cheaper areas. This suggests that lower interest rates increase housing wealth inequality, while higher rates do the opposite. However, these effects appear to be temporary."

 """,2020.,"Credit Spreads, Monetary Policy and the Price Puzzle","rdp2020-01, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Identifying the causal effect of monetary policy on inflation remains a challenge. Researchers frequently find evidence of a 'price puzzle': increases in the policy rate are followed by higher rather than lower inflation. This can be explained by the forward-looking behaviour of the central bank. Inflation does not rise in response to an increase in the policy rate but, instead, the central bank raises its policy rate when it expects inflation to increase in the future. To identify the true causal effects of monetary policy on inflation, it is hence necessary to control for this systematic policy response to expected inflation. For Australia, however, the price puzzle has been found even when controlling for the cash rate's systematic response to the Reserve Bank's own inflation forecasts. I argue that this is due to an additional but omitted systematic response of the cash rate to credit market shocks. Easier credit market conditions lead to an economic expansion and higher inflation. Therefore, the Bank raises the cash rate – its policy rate – when credit spreads decline. However, the Bank's inflation forecasts do not fully capture the inflationary effect of easier credit conditions. As a result, cash rate changes are positively correlated with future inflation even when purging them of the cash rate's response to the Bank's inflation forecasts. Accordingly, I show that accounting for the cash rate's additional response to credit market conditions resolves the price puzzle. As expected, a higher cash rate reduces inflation and output growth, and raises the unemployment rate."

We find that past encounters with counterfeits, and past experience of problems using banknotes, significantly worsen an indivdual's perceived counterfeit risk. Females, younger adults, and people with low income are also found to assess the counterfeit risk more negatively. Conversely, and with the exception of being a younger adult or having had serious problems using banknotes, confidence in the system to remove counterfeits is largely unaffected by demographic factors or past exposure to counterfeits. Awareness of a banknote upgrade program does not seem to have much effect on confidence, while knowing more security features of banknotes is associated with higher confidence. To assess the relationship between media coverage and public confidence in banknotes we use monthly data on media reports on counterfeiting, genuine banknotes mistakenly submitted as counterfeits, and actual counterfeit detections. As more unique counterfeit incidents are reported in the media, more genuine banknotes are mistakenly submitted as counterfeits, which we interpret as media coverage heightening the sense of counterfeit risk."

 """,2019.,China's Evolving Monetary Policy Framework in International Context,"rdp2019-11, Reserve Bank of Australia.","China's monetary policy framework has evolved considerably over the years. However, official descriptions provide limited detail and it generally remains less well understood than befits the world's second largest economy. This paper takes stock of the evolution of monetary policy in China and, by placing these developments in international context, also contributes to the emerging discussion about whether aspects of monetary policy in China are beginning to converge on advanced economy norms. Our main takeaways are as follows. First, on the institutional set-up, we note that the absence of instrument independence and the nature of accountability mechanisms remain substantial points of difference, reflecting China's single-party state system in which the levers of macroeconomic management remain highly coordinated under the State Council. Second, the objectives for monetary policy in China and how they find practical expression in the operational framework continue to have few parallels in advanced economies, although some implementation features (such as the corridor for policy rates) are more familiar as China continues to transition from a quantity- to price-based monetary system. Third, elements of The People's Bank of China's communication framework are broadly evolving along the lines observed elsewhere, with remaining exceptions mostly a result of China's unique institutional arrangements. Fourth, our empirical analysis of monetary policy transmission points to both similarities and differences: while policy rates now have a larger effect than monetary aggregates on output and bond yields, reflecting a Chinese financial system that is becoming more developed (as in advanced economies in the 1970s–1980s), the similar average inflation outcomes observed in China and advanced economies have been generated through different means. In sum, our analysis suggests that while some aspects of monetary policy in China are beginning to resemble those observed in advanced economies, convergence is neither likely nor even desired by the authorities given China's institutional configuration and preferred model of economic development."

 """,2019.,Emergency Liquidity Injections,"rdp2019-10, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper compares the effectiveness of different forms of emergency liquidity injections, including secured lending (repo), unsecured lending and securities purchases. The model features an endogenous banking crisis, funding and market liquidity interactions, and fire sale externalities. Injection policies are compared by their effects on ex ante incentives and on ex post outcomes. The model demonstrates that lending to banks via repo can curb fire selling of relatively illiquid securities that are accepted as collateral, due to binding collateral constraints. The mitigated securities price depression, relative to an unsecured lending policy, counteracts the effects of fire sale externalities. This reduces banks' losses on illiquid securities without incentivising more liquidity risk-taking. Under an unsecured or secured lending policy, the authority can charge 'penalty rates' to deter liquidity risk-taking, but to be credible, lending should be long term so that repayments are due after liquidity conditions improve. Otherwise, the repayments can cause further liquidity distress, compromising the policy objectives. Liquidity injections via securities purchases cannot credibly be penalising, because the policy does not require banks to commit future income."

 """,2019.,Australian Money Market Divergence: Arbitrage Opportunity or Illusion?,"rdp2019-09, Reserve Bank of Australia.","In recent years, the spread between money market interest rates has widened. One implication is that the price of Australian dollars diverges across these markets. Even after risks associated with creditworthiness, liquidity and other factors have been taken into account, it appears that unexploited arbitrage opportunities persist. Typically the literature only assesses the profitability of arbitrage by calculating the return from funding at low money market rates to invest at higher rates. However, banks have broader balance sheet considerations that need to be taken into account. We therefore take a 'whole-of-balance-sheet' approach to assessing the potential for arbitrage opportunities available to the four major banks in Australia. this takes into consideration that banks optimise their balance sheet not only by funding themselves at the lowest possible rates to maximise profitability, but also for compliance with prudential regulation, maintenance of capital adequacy, and opportunity cost in asset allocation. We find that once asset-specific funding costs are taken into account, short-term money market trades would have generally not been profitable for the major banks. Overall, the incentive for banks to arbitrage has fallen since 2008. Our result reflects both a rise in the cost of debt funding relative to market returns and an increase in the share of equity funding. We also note that the deployment of balance sheet space to money market trading incurs a significant opportunity cost, when compared to lending for residential housing. Not surprisingly, the balance sheets of the major banks are therefore skewed toward more profitable lending activities, rather than money market trading."

But there are other means to study, from the same 'quasilinear' family. And they can support very different conclusions. In trade research, for instance, studying other means can transform the perceived roles of colonial history, geography, and trade wars. In wages research, studying other means can reverse perceived earnings differentials between groups. Similar scenarios will be common in other tasks of policy evaluation and forecasting. To choose means well I propose selection criteria, which also consider options that are outside of the quasilinear family, such as quantiles. Optimal choices are application-specific and ideally accommodate the preferences of the relevant policymaker. In the wages case, policymaker aversion to inequality makes it sensible to reject the arithmetic mean for another quasilinear one."

Most of the model's equations align closely with the way RBA staff typically interpret the behaviour of individual economic variables.

We find evidence consistent with a 'debt overhang effect' – households cut back on their spending when they have higher levels of outstanding mortgage debt. This overhang effect holds even when households' net housing wealth remains constant, implying that households reduce their spending when the gross value of both their debt and assets increases. This suggests that changes in the composition of household balance sheets affect spending, which runs counter to macroeconomic models that combine assets and liabilities into a single measure of net wealth. We find the overhang effect to be pervasive across owner-occupier households and not exclusively driven by households that are financially constrained or that have strong precautionary saving motives. We find evidence that indebted households reduce their spending by more than other households during adverse macroeconomic shocks, such as the global financial crisis, but the negative effect of debt is also pervasive at other times."

Many recent papers have attempted to quantify and evaluate the effects of this policy. This paper summarises this research and applies the approach to Australia. The papers we survey see the benefit of leaning against the wind as avoiding financial crises, such as those that affected Australia in 1990 or other countries in 2008. Most of the international research finds that interest rates have too small an effect on the probability of a crisis for this benefit to be worth higher unemployment. Using Australian data, we find similar results. We estimate the costs of leaning against the wind to be three to eight times larger than the benefit of avoiding financial crises. However, research has not yet quantified the increased resilience of household balance sheets, which may be an extra benefit of leaning against the wind."

Our main goal is to assess different channels through which spillovers occur and why some economies' interest rates respond more than others. We find that there is no evidence that spillovers relate to real linkages, such as trade flows. There is some indication that exchange rate regimes influence the extent of spillovers. By far the strongest determinant of interest rate spillovers is financial openness. Economies that have stronger bilateral (and aggregate) financial links with the United States or euro area are susceptible to stronger interest rate spillovers. These effects are much more pronounced at the longer end of the yield curve, indicating that while economies retain policy rate independence, financial conditions are influenced by global yields."

Some have suggested that this decline has caused a fall in the bargaining power of workers, which in turn has contributed to low wages growth in recent years. We test this hypothesis using a newly available source of micro data, covering all enterprise agreements federally registered between 1991 and 2017. We find that changing unionisation patterns are unlikely to account for much of the recent low wages growth. This conclusion reflects three key results. First, there has been no decline in the share of employees covered by enterprise agreements negotiated with union involvement even as union membership has declined. Second, the 'union wage growth premium' in the private sector has been stable over time. Third, spillover effects from union involvement in enterprise agreement negotiations onto wage outcomes in other enterprise agreements exist, but have not changed materially over time."

Such information would be of interest for a number of reasons, including to aid in forecasting future banknote demand, and to assess the extent to which banknotes are used to facilitate illegal activities or avoid tax obligations. To address this we use a range of techniques to estimate the whereabouts and uses of Australian banknotes. The techniques that we employ suggest that, of total outstanding banknotes: 15–35 per cent are used to facilitate legitimate transactions; roughly half to three-quarters are hoarded as a store of wealth or for other purposes, of which we can allocate 10–20 percentage points to domestic hoarding and up to 15 percentage points to international hoarding; 4–8 per cent are used in the shadow economy; and 5–10 per cent are lost."

 """,2018.,"Consumer Credit Card Choice: Costs, Benefits and Behavioural Biases","rdp2018-11, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The credit card market offers consumers a wide range of options when choosing a card. While many factors may influence this choice, this paper focuses on the main financial costs and benefits of holding a credit card. I summarise these costs and benefits as the net monetary benefit associated with a card. Theory might suggest that a rational consumer will choose a card that maximises their net monetary benefit. But in reality, consumers' decisions may be systematically biased, leading them to select higher-cost credit cards when lower-cost alternatives are available. To test this possibility, I first estimate the net monetary cost or benefit that individuals in a nationally representative survey obtain from their credit card. I then use these estimates to examine whether principles from behavioural economics – such as optimism bias, bounded rationality and present bias – can help to explain consumers' choice of credit card. I find that approximately 40 per cent of Australian credit card holders receive a positive net monetary benefit from their card (that is, they receive benefits from rewards points and their interest-free period that outweigh annual fees and interest payments). Generally these are higher-wealth and higher-income consumers. Of the remaining 60 per cent, around half break even, while half incur a net cost. Moreover, most cardholders, including those who receive a net benefit, appear not to choose cards that best suit their use patterns – for instance, I estimate that consumers who use their card to borrow and pay interest could reduce their annual costs by around $250 by choosing a more appropriate card. Behavioural explanations are consistent with some, but not all, of the patterns observed. Consumers appear to be subject to optimism bias, underestimating how much they will borrow on their card, and a subset of consumers tend to hold inflated estimates of the net monetary benefits that they receive from their card. In contrast, consumers do not appear to be present biased in responding to temporary sign-up offers. Finally, I find that around half of the respondents who made a net loss held high-cost cards, but had not considered switching to a lower-cost card; indicative evidence of cognitive, as well as practical, barriers to switching cards."

 """,2018.,Wage Growth Puzzles and Technology,"rdp2018-10, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Economists have been grappling with both a long-run and a shorter-run wage 'puzzle'. The long-run wage puzzle is why real wages have for decades been growing slower than labour productivity: that is, why the labour share of national income has been falling. The shorter-run puzzle is why nominal wages have for some years been growing slower than model-based forecasts have predicted. This paper suggests that an important part of the explanation for both puzzles may lie at the individual firm level, rather than at the macro level. The uneven take-up of new technology is resulting in increasing dispersion in productivity performance across firms in a given industry. High productivity firms would appear to be using most of their higher levels of productivity to reduce prices and increase profit margins rather than passing most of it on to their workforce in higher wages, while the productivity 'laggards' have limited scope to pay higher wages. If employment growth is much less dispersed than productivity growth across firms, as overseas evidence suggests is the case, these observations may help to explain not just declining labour shares of national income but also low average productivity growth and subdued nominal wages growth. The paper sets out some research proposals designed to further explore these linkages. Given the broadening application across industries of new information and communication technology, if the above forces are indeed at play they may prove pervasive and long lasting, with important implications for monetary policy over the cycle."

Despite this, the global research community has not analysed the microstructure of interbank repo markets in the same detail as unsecured markets, because loan-level repo data have not been available. This paper provides and assesses an algorithm for extracting loan-level repo data from over-the-counter securities transactions data, and it applies to securities transactions data from Austraclear. This approach is similar to how loan-level unsecured data are typically obtained from payments data. False detection and false omission rates are estimated to be 3 per cent or less. While separate prudential data indicate a larger repo market than the algorithm data, likely reflecting repos transacted through foreign (i.e. non-Austraclear) infrastructure, the two datasets have a robust positive relationship. The algorithm data, capturing non-RBA repos of up to 14-days maturity from several 2-month data samples between 2006 and 2015, reveal various market features. From 2006 to 2015, the distribution of repo-rate spreads (to the cash rate) drifted up and tightened, and the market shifted towards overnight maturities. Loan-level repo rates depend on the loan size and the types of counterparties, but not how long the repo is open. In 2015, the market's network structure comprises a tightly integrated core, and a segmented periphery with few counterparties. Repo haircuts do not display obvious patterns, appearing randomly distributed around zero."

The policy gave all businesses undertaking equipment investment extra tax deductions and gave larger deductions to small businesses. We exploit this differential treatment to identify the effect of the tax credit using business-level datasets from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The key conclusions that emerge are: 1. The tax break had a strong effect on business-level investment. We find this result using both difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity methods. 2. The tax break increased the investment of companies , despite Australia's imputation system for corporate dividends implying that their costs of capital were unaffected. This suggests that a non-standard mechanism, such as a relaxation in financial constraints, underlies part of the response to tax incentives. To the extent that this is the case, it may suggest that such policies are more effective during downturns, when financial constraints are more binding. Relatedly, there is no evidence that businesses responded by bringing forward investment from future years (i.e. intertemporal substitution). 3. The tax break was important on a macroeconomic level. General equilibrium estimates suggest that both GDP growth and the cash rate would have been significantly lower in 2009 without the tax break. While our work suggests that tax rates and breaks can affect real decisions for Australian corporates, despite the existence of the dividend imputation system, it provides only limited guidance on the potential effects of policies other than the one we study. Other policies will differ in terms of their timing, permanence and targeting, all of which could influence their effectiveness."

This led to larger award wage rises in percentage terms for jobs whose award wages were relatively low, compared to those on higher award wages. I find that adjustments to awards are almost fully passed on to wages in award-reliant jobs. I find no evidence that these small, incremental increases in award wages have an adverse effect on hours worked or the job destruction rate."

Also, since the global financial crisis, the spread between the rates paid by companies at the top and bottom of the distribution has widened. Borrowing rates for a large portion of companies, including smaller and riskier ones, have remained high in recent years, despite falls in aggregate indicators of interest rates. This heterogeneity in borrowing rates enables us to find a significant inverse relationship between the cost of debt and corporate investment, which is generally not evident in aggregate data. We argue that this relationship may be due to credit supply effects, as a relaxation of lending standards leads to lower credit spreads and encourages more investment.

The model has four intermediate sectors: non-traded, housing, traded, and resources. Households are assumed to consume housing services as part of their consumption bundle and gain utility from holding housing stock. The utility specification increases households' willingness to hold housing stock and implies a relatively high sensitivity of housing investment to monetary policy. We estimate the model on Australian data and find that our model is better able to match a number of empirical regularities compared to a model without housing. These regularities include the sensitivity of housing investment to interest rates and the persistence of aggregate output's response to monetary policy shocks. We then use the model to explore the role of the housing sector in the rebalancing of the Australian economy following the end of the mining boom. First, we find that most of the recent increase in housing investment has been an endogenous response to the large fall in commodity prices and associated declines in interest rates. Second, the pick-up in housing investment has significantly supported the economy over the past five years, ading a ½ percentage point to GDP growth and a ¼ percentage point to inflation, in year-ended terms."

For detached houses, marginal costs comprise the dwelling structure and the land that other home owners need to forego. Relative to our estimates of these costs, we find that, as of 2016, zoning raised detached house prices 73 per cent above marginal costs in Sydney, 69 per cent in Melbourne, 42 per cent in Brisbane and 54 per cent in Perth. Zoning has also raised the price of apartments well above the marginal cost of supply, especially in Sydney. We emphasise that this is not the amount that housing prices would fall in the absence of zoning. The effect of zoning has increased dramatically over the past two decades, likely due to existing restrictions binding more tightly as demand has risen."

The results should not be interpreted too precisely given data limitations and the complexity of the model.

At the same time, long-term inflation expectations have remained firmly within the Reserve Bank's 2 to 3 per cent target band and have been more stable than suggested by measures of break-even inflation.

Understanding the network of relationships between borrowers and lenders in this market, and how it changes during periods of stress, is crucial for understanding the resilience of the market. However, a difficulty with analysing this market is that existing methods of determining which banks are in the core of the network can be highly inaccurate when the network is either highly connected relative to the true proportion of banks in the core, or relatively sparsely connected (a novel finding). We derive a 'density-based' estimator of core/periphery network structures that is designed to overcome these inaccuracies. And we show that our estimator outperforms the commonly used estimators in numerical simulations. These results have broad applicability to the network analysis literature. We then use our density-based estimator to analyse the Australian overnight interbank market, focusing on the 2007–08 financial crisis. Our results suggest that the crisis had a large and long-lasting effect on this market. In particular, we find that the typical core size fell from eight to five banks during the crisis, because of large reductions in the number of lending relationships between some banks. Compared with the pre-crisis period, the remaining core lent much less to the periphery, while the periphery lent more to the core; these changes are consistent with models of precautionary liquidity demand."

 """,2017.,The Property Ladder after the Financial Crisis: The First Step is a Stretch but Those Who Make It Are Doing OK,"rdp2017-05, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The global financial crisis (GFC) focused attention on household debt in dramatic fashion. While Australia escaped much of the immediate fallout, concerns over the level of household debt have become more entwined in policy deliberations in recent years. Parallel concerns, flowing from the rapid growth in housing prices in Australia and focusing on first home buyers, have also emerged. Some are concerned that this rapid growth is shutting a generation out of the home ownership market. Others are worried that those who do manage to buy a first home are taking on inadvisable levels of debt to do so. This paper investigates how things have changed since the GFC for those stepping onto the property ladder. Is 'generation rent' an important trend? Are people buying first homes taking on 'too much' debt? And what implications does this have for our understanding of the growing level of aggregate household debt? We find that fewer people are making the transition from renters to owners than prior to the crisis. Those that do, however, are more financially stable than earlier cohorts. Thus, 'generation rent' is an important trend but a consequence is that those who do step onto the property ladder are, on average, better placed to pay off their loans. We attribute much of this change to the increase in housing prices and the associated hurdle that deposit requirements represent. While saving a deposit is a stretch, it is also a sign of financial discipline that is associated with fewer subsequent difficulties."

The data show that Australian consumers continued to switch from paper-based ways of making payments such as cash and cheques, towards digital payment methods (particularly debit and credit cards). Cards were the most frequently used means of payment in the 2016 survey, overtaking cash for the first time. Contactless 'tap and go' cards are an increasingly popular way of making payments, displacing cash for many lower-value transactions. Despite these trends, cash still accounts for a material share of consumer payments and is intensively used by some segments of the population. Payments using a mobile phone at a card terminal are a relatively new feature of the payments system and this technology was not widely used at the time of the survey. However, consumers are increasingly using their mobile phones to make online and person-to-person payments. Similarly, consumers are using automatic payments, such as direct debits, more frequently."

 """,2017.,Financialisation and the Term Structure of Commodity Risk Premiums,"rdp2017-03, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Commodities, such as oil and wheat, are important inputs into the real economy. They have a significant influence on the welfare of individuals through their role as consumption goods and as inputs into other goods. As such, it is important to understand how commodity prices are set and whether there are any distortions to these prices. One component of commodity futures prices is the risk premium, which reflects the return investors demand to take on producers' and consumers' natural exposures to commodity prices. Therefore, to better understand the determination of commodity futures prices this paper examines commodity risk premiums and their determinants. We find evidence that commodity risk premiums vary across futures contract maturities, and that the shape of the commodity risk premium 'curve' differs across commodities and over time. This suggests information could be contained in the shape of the risk premium curve. We also find strong evidence of a relationship between the net of producers' (short) and consumers' (long) hedging positions – the net hedging position – and risk premiums, as would be suggested by the net hedging pressure theory. The evidence is generally more significant for longer-dated futures contracts. In addition, we consider whether the large increase in the size of commodity-related financial markets over the 2000s – commodity market financialisation – has affected commodity risk premiums. We find little statistical evidence that financialisation has had a significant effect on the 'residual' or idiosyncratic portion of commodity risk premiums for a broad basket of commodities. But we do find some evidence of smaller residual risk premiums for wheat, particularly for short-maturity contracts. This could reflect either decreased market segmentation or a secular increase in demand for long positions. We also find evidence that financialisation increased the systematic portion of commodity risk premiums by increasing the correlation between returns on commodity futures and returns on the 'market' portfolio. This was more evident for longer-maturity contracts of 6–18 months."

This 'price puzzle' is commonly thought to reflect interest rates being tightened in anticipation of future inflation, reflecting information possessed by policymakers beyond that contained in the model. Romer and Romer (2004) and Cloyne and Hürtgen (2016) successfully remove the price puzzle from US and UK data, respectively, by purging the cash rate of systematic policy responses to central bank forecasts. We find that this approach does not work for Australia under a wide range of specifications. This suggests that VARs may not be the most reliable way to analyse monetary policy."

 """,2017.,Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,"rdp2017-01, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Since November 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the US Federal Reserve has regularly published participants' qualitative assessments of the uncertainty attending their individual forecasts of real activity and inflation, expressed relative to that seen on average in the past. The benchmarks used for these historical comparisons are the average root mean squared forecast errors (RMSEs) made by various private and government forecasters over the past twenty years. This paper documents how these benchmarks are constructed and discusses some of their properties. We draw several conclusions. First, if past performance is a reasonable guide to future accuracy, considerable uncertainty surrounds all macroeconomic projections, including those of FOMC participants. Second, different forecasters have similar accuracy. Third, estimates of uncertainty about future real activity and interest rates are now considerably greater than prior to the financial crisis; in contrast, estimates of inflation accuracy have changed little. Finally, fan charts – constructed as plus-or-minus one RMSE intervals about the median FOMC forecast, under the expectation that future projection errors will be unbiased and symmetrically distributed, and that the intervals cover about 70 percent of possible outcomes – provide a reasonable approximation to future uncertainty, especially when viewed in conjuction with the FOMC's qualitative assessments. That said, an assumption of symmetry about the interest rate outlook is problematic if the expected path of the federal funds rate is expected to remain low."

 """,2016.,The Household Cash Flow Channel of Monetary Policy,"rdp2016-12, Reserve Bank of Australia.","We explore whether changes in interest rates affect household consumption by changing the amount of cash that households have to spend – the household cash flow channel of monetary policy. Based on a panel of Australian households, we find that, when interest rates decline, the cash flows and durable goods spending of households with variable-rate mortgage debt increases relative to comparable fixed-rate borrowers. This is consistent with a 'borrower' cash flow channel. We also find that lower interest rates reduce the cash flows available to households that receive interest on bank deposits and that this, in turn, is associated with lower spending by these households. This is consistent with a 'lender' cash flow channel. Overall, the borrower channel is a stronger channel of monetary transmission than the lender channel, such that lower interest rates will typically increase household cash flows and lead to higher spending in aggregate. The central estimates imply that lowering interest rates by 100 basis points would be associated with an increase in aggregate household expenditure of about 0.1 to 0.2 per cent per annum. Overall, the household cash flow channel appears to be an important channel of monetary transmission in Australia."

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has historically gathered information about this market via a survey that provided a summary of participants' daily lending and borrowing. These data were highly aggregated and, until May 2016, were the RBA's only source of quantitative information on this market. This paper develops an innovative algorithm that identifies overnight interbank loans from the millions of payments settled through Australia's high-value payments system. Using this algorithm, we are able to construct a historical loan-level database. By comparing aggregates from our database to the survey data collected by the RBA, we conclude that our algorithm successfully identifies these loans. Between 2005 and 2015, the daily correlations between the summary data and the algorithm output are greater than 90 per cent. The novel features of our algorithm are important; applying existing algorithms to Australia produces correlations below 40 per cent. So these novel features may also be useful for identifying overnight interbank loans in other countries. Using the loan-level database, this paper explores features of the market that were previously unobservable. But the main advantage of this new database is the ability to conduct previously infeasible analyses of this market, such as forthcoming analysis of how the market evolved during the global financial crisis."

 """,2016.,The Effect of Consumer Sentiment on Consumption,"rdp2016-10, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper seeks to identify whether changes in consumer sentiment have a direct effect on consumption. In order to demonstrate a causal effect running from sentiment to consumption we need to identify changes in sentiment that are likely to be unrelated to other factors simultaneously affecting sentiment and consumption. To do this, we take advantage of the fact that immediately after elections at which there is a change of government consumers supporting the winning party report substantially more optimistic expectations about both personal and general economic conditions than supporters of the losing party. Following a change of government, we find robust evidence that supporters of the winning party report higher spending intentions than supporters of the losing party, providing evidence that consumer sentiment has a causal effect on consumption. We also find evidence that, following changes of government, motor vehicle purchases increased by relatively more in postcodes with a greater share of votes for the winning party. This provides evidence that self-reported spending intentions are indicative of actual consumption behaviour. Because the share of supporters for the government and the opposition is similar, the variation in sentiment that we use for identification is not evident at the national level. Thus, our results do not imply that changes of government have a noticeable effect on aggregate consumption. However, they do imply a causal effect that can run from sentiment to consumption."

 """,2016.,Why Do Companies Fail?,"rdp2016-09, Reserve Bank of Australia.","We explore the determinants of corporate failure in Australia using a large panel of public and private non-financial companies. A novel finding of our research is that corporate failure depends on 'structural' company-level characteristics. For instance, public companies are more likely to fail than comparable private companies; perhaps because the greater separation of ownership and control within public companies allows their managers to take greater risks. Consistent with overseas research, we find that cyclical company-specific factors are important determinants of failure; a corporation is more likely to fail if it has low liquidity, low profitability or high leverage. Cyclical and structural company-level characteristics are the key determinants of the relative risk of a company failing, while aggregate (macroeconomic) conditions appear to be an important determinant of annual changes in the rate of corporate failure. We quantify the potential contribution of corporate failure to financial stability risks using a 'debt-at-risk' framework. By our estimates, less than 1 per cent of aggregate corporate debt is currently at risk, with debt at risk concentrated in some very large companies. Our estimates suggest that trade credit (or business-to-business lending) is an important component of the relationship between corporate failure and financial stability."

The decline in productivity growth was hard to detect in real time – the behaviour of households and firms indicates that their beliefs about steady-state productivity growth did not adjust until the early-to-mid 2000s. As well as reducing growth in output, slower productivity growth has lowered the neutral real interest rate in the United States and made it harder for monetary policy to combat recessions.

Cyclical Labour Market Adjustment in Australia,"rdp2016-06, Reserve Bank of Australia.","During a downturn, firms can reduce their use of labour by reducing the number of workers they employ and/or by reducing the hours worked by their employees. The nature of adjustment can have implications for the economy, particularly given the costs associated with unemployment; reducing employment is likely to be more costly than reducing hours. We explore the nature of cyclical labour market adjustment in Australia, using both aggregate time series data and an individual-level panel dataset of labour force transitions during the late 2000s downturn. We find that the share of labour market adjustment due to changes in average hours worked has increased threefold since the late 1990s. This has not been the case for the major advanced economies. We argue that the short and shallow nature of the economic downturns in Australia since the late 1990s has played a role in this, while labour market reforms may also have contributed. An important driver of cyclical adjustments in average hours during downturns looks to have been reductions in hours worked for employees who remained in the same job, as opposed to changes in the composition of aggregate employment."

We estimate first-stage pass-through to be only around 14 per cent after two years for imports invoiced in Australian dollars, which is quantitatively important given that this accounts for about 30 per cent of imports. In contrast, first-stage pass-through for foreign currency-invoiced imports is immediate and complete. These results are likely to reflect foreign exporters with low desired pass-through choosing to invoice in Australian dollars. Our results have several important implications. First, Australian dollar invoicing dampens the response of importers' costs to exchange rate changes and so may make consumer price inflation less responsive to exchange rate changes, increasingly so if Australian dollar invoicing becomes more prevalent. Second, import price models that impose the law of one price are likely to be unsuitable, at least over relatively short-run periods. Third, invoice-share-weighted exchange rate indices should be preferable to trade-share-weighted exchange rate indices for modelling import price changes, although the empirical evidence on this is weak. Finally, exogenous changes in the exchange rate might have persistent effects on the goods terms of trade."

Rognlie (2015) has since shown that this is largely due to the housing sector. I explore the determinants of the secular rise in the share of housing capital income (or 'rental income') in the US economy. I first decompose the aggregate national accounts by geographic region and also by type of housing. I then exploit variation across US states in factors that could explain housing capital income, such as interest rates, housing prices and income growth. I show that the long-run increase in the aggregate share of housing capital income is mainly due to higher imputed rental income going to owner-occupiers. I also find evidence that the rise in the share of housing capital income over recent decades reflects a combination of: 1) lower real interest rates; 2) lower consumer price inflation; and 3) constraints on the supply of new housing in some large US cities. In effect, I argue that the fall in nominal interest rates over the 1980s and 1990s raised the demand for housing and pushed up housing prices and rents (relative to non-housing prices) in supply-constrained areas. I estimate that the long-term decline in interest rates can explain more than half the increase in the share of nominal income spent on housing since the early 1980s."

 """,2016.,Why Do Companies Hold Cash?,"rdp2016-03, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Over the past quarter century, Australian companies have been increasingly holding assets in the form of currency and deposits, or 'cash', rather than investing in other productive assets. This reflects a global trend and raises the question of whether Australian companies now hold 'too much' cash. Despite Australian non-financial companies holding high levels of cash by international standards, we find little evidence that the increase has been 'excessive'. Instead, we find that the rise in corporate cash is mostly due to changes over time in observable company characteristics, including an apparent increase in the growth opportunities of publicly listed companies (as proxied by Tobin's Q). We also find some evidence of 'cohort effects' as Australian companies are more likely to be 'born', or come into existence, today in industries that have relatively high levels of cash, such as information technology, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. We also find evidence that public companies hold more cash than private companies, on average. This is consistent with agency conflicts between owners and managers playing a role in corporate decisions to hold cash. Overall, we find that, in the face of financing frictions, some Australian companies have speculative and precautionary motives for holding cash. It follows that high levels of corporate cash do not necessarily indicate a weak outlook for corporate investment but might, in some cases, actually imply more investment opportunities."

I use the index to assess how uncertainty affects the Australian economy. Consistent with the 'real options' channel of uncertainty, I find that it reduces investment and employment growth. Similarly, uncertainty raises the household saving ratio and reduces consumption growth for durable goods, consistent with the 'precautionary savings' channel of uncertainty. My results suggest that economic uncertainty can be an important independent driver of economic outcomes. It is therefore worth considering in policy and empirical work."

Based on household-level information from the Household Expenditure Survey we find that consumption inequality is lower on average than income inequality, but that income and consumption inequality have both increased a little since the early 1990s, with income inequality increasing by more. These findings are broadly similar to the changes in income and consumption inequality documented in other developed economies. We provide insight into the welfare implications of these changes using panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. We decompose the broad trends in income inequality into four statistical components: (i) changes in observed household characteristics; (ii) changes in the returns to unobserved skills; (iii) changes in the size of persistent income shocks (reflecting events such as promotions and long-term unemployment); and (iv) changes in the size of transitory income shocks (reflecting events such as bonuses, short-term unemployment and short-term illness). The reported trends in income inequality do not appear to be due to changes in observed household characteristics, but rather to changes in the size of persistent and transitory income shocks. Since the middle of the 2000s, at least some of the increase in income inequality has been due to persistent factors, a conclusion that is consistent with the rise in consumption inequality over the corresponding period."

In addition, it suggests a strategy to optimise the selection of moving holiday corrections that account for Chinese New Year, the Dragon Boat festival and the Mid-Autumn festival, prior to seasonal adjustment. It is argued that seasonal adjustment performed with this approach is preferable to simpler techniques."

This particular model is designed to help answer a specific question, namely: What is the level of the exchange rate that would be expected to prevail over the medium term based on the exchange rate's historical relationships with other theoretically and empirically relevant variables? Notwithstanding the well-documented difficulties in empirically modelling exchange rates, the ECM has displayed robust explanatory power for a number of decades, in large part due to the strong historical relationship between Australia's terms of trade and the real exchange rate. That said, it is still worth considering whether two recent unusual economic forces – namely, Australia's resources boom and the adoption of unconventional monetary policy by several major foreign central banks – have been adequately captured by the model. With this purpose in mind, the paper also discusses several extensions to the ECM. Overall, these extensions provide little evidence that the relationships between the RTWI and its historical determinants have changed substantially over time. While there is some evidence that unusual economic forces did contribute to the exchange rate being somewhat higher in recent years than would otherwise have been the case, we do not find compelling evidence of omitted variables that have substantially influenced the exchange rate over a longer period of time."

Without accurate predictions of banknote life, there is a risk of incurring the economic costs of overproducing and storing excess banknotes or conversely, in an extreme case, of not being able to meet the public's demand. The life of a banknote, however, is not directly observed and must be estimated – a process complicated by the manner in which banknotes are issued and circulated. Often currency issuers use simple turnover formulas to estimate the mean or median life of banknotes; however, such measures tend to be particularly volatile over time as they cannot take into account shocks to currency demand, or changes to currency issuer policies that affect distribution arrangements or the quality of circulating banknotes. This paper proposes an alternative way of studying banknote life by estimating survival models, which are commonly used in studying life expectancies in medicine or the duration of events in economics. These models can produce estimates of central tendency that are much less volatile over time and provide information on the probability that banknotes survive over time. The models' predictions of banknote survival are intuitive and the results are consistent with samples of circulating and unfit banknotes."

We investigate the relationship between housing wealth and consumption using postcode-level variation in house prices and administrative data on new passenger vehicle registrations as a proxy for consumption. In our preferred specification, we estimate an elasticity of new passenger vehicle registrations with respect to gross housing wealth of 0.4–0.5, and an average marginal propensity to consume (MPC) for new passenger vehicles of about 0.06 cents per dollar change in gross housing wealth. Assuming new vehicle registrations and total consumption have the same sensitivity to changes in housing wealth implies an MPC for total consumption of 2 cents per dollar change in gross housing wealth. But US evidence indicates that new vehicle consumption is particularly sensitive to changes in housing wealth. Assuming the same is true for Australia, our estimates imply an MPC for total consumption of less than 0.25 cents. Notably, we find evidence that the relationship between house prices and new vehicle registrations is heterogenous in income, with low-income households having a higher propensity to purchase a new vehicle following a rise in housing wealth than high-income households. This implies that the distribution of changes in house prices is relevant for understanding its effect on aggregate consumption."

This paper explores the ex post credit risk experience – the 'credit loss' experience – of the Australian banking system. It does so using a newly compiled dataset covering bank-level credit losses over 1980 to 2013. The Australian credit loss experience is dominated by two episodes: the very large losses around the early 1990s recession and the losses during and after the global financial crisis. The available data indicate the above-average losses during both periods were on lending to businesses. Credit losses on housing loans during and after the global financial crisis were minimal in Australia. Consistent with this, an econometric panel-data model that properly accounts for portfolio composition indicates that conditions in the business sector, rather than those in the household sector, drove credit losses in Australia during the period studied. The data also indicate that the very worst credit loss outcomes – including those that led to the failure of several state government-owned banks in the early 1990s – were driven by poor lending standards."

Law enforcement agencies allocate substantial resources to deter, detect and prosecute counterfeiting operations, households and businesses suffer a direct loss to counterfeiters and undertake costly prevention measures, and central banks spend considerable resources upgrading and improving the security of banknotes. Without these prevention efforts, there is a risk that the public could lose confidence in the currency and reduce its use relative to more costly payment alternatives. This paper examines the social costs of counterfeiting in Australia. First, we provide some statistics on counterfeiting domestically and compare Australia's experience with some other economies internationally. We find that the direct costs of counterfeiting in Australia are relatively low when compared with other economies, but that there can be substantial deadweight costs associated with prevention efforts and losses of confidence in the currency. Second, we focus on quantifying the effect of a loss of confidence in the currency. To do this, we estimate a structural vector autoregression using the Australian data. In response to a positive one standard deviation counterfeiting shock, the demand for banknotes declines and the use of credit cards and bank deposits increase. These results are consistent with the presence of substitution effects. Using a scenario to quantify the real resource costs associated with these substitution effects, our estimates suggest that an increase in counterfeiting of around A$140 000, spread over ten years, leads to a total increase in social costs of A$7.0 million. Although the statistical uncertainty implied in the model and scenario estimates is large, the results suggest that there are significant pay-offs from efforts to prevent and deter counterfeiting activity in Australia."

Just as the price a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service is indicative of the value he/she places on that item, the willingness to pay a surcharge to use a payment method reflects that method's value to that customer, relative to any alternatives. We find a wide dispersion in the willingness to pay for the use of cards. Around 60 per cent of consumers are unwilling to pay a 0.1 per cent surcharge, which suggests that for these individuals, the net benefits of cards are very small or that cash is actually preferred. At the other end of the distribution, some individuals (around 5 per cent) are willing to pay more than a 4 per cent surcharge, indicating they place a substantial value on paying using cards. On average, consumers have a higher willingness to pay for the use of credit cards than debit cards. This difference can be viewed as the additional value placed on the non-payment functions – rewards and the interest-free period – of credit cards. We estimate that on average credit card holders place a value of 0.6 basis points on every 1 basis point of effective rewards rebate. Based on the survey data and information on the costs to merchants of accepting payment methods, we can predict the mix of cash, debit card and credit card payments chosen by consumers under different levels of surcharging and explore the implications for the efficiency of the payments system. In particular, the consumer surplus in a scenario where merchants do not surcharge and the costs of all payment methods are built into retail prices can be compared with that where merchants surcharge based on payment costs and retail prices are correspondingly lower. Our findings suggest that cost-based surcharging leads to some consumers switching to less costly payment methods, resulting in greater efficiency of the payment system and an increase in consumer surplus of 13 basis points per transaction."

The reforms aim to reduce interconnectedness and improve counterparty risk management in these important markets. At the same time, however, the reforms necessarily concentrate risk in one or a few CCPs and also increase institutions' demand for high-quality assets to meet collateral requirements. This paper looks more closely at the implications of these reforms for the stability of the financial network. Following Heath, Kelly and Manning (2013), the paper examines liquidity and solvency risk under alternative clearing configurations, but extends the analysis in two main ways. First, rather than using simulated data, it uses actual data on the derivative positions of the 41 largest bank participants in global OTC derivative markets in 2012 (as previously used by the Bank for International Settlements' Macroeconomic Assessment Group on Derivatives). Second, it extends the methodolgy to consider in greater depth the implications of loss allocation by CCPs to meet obligations once pre-funded financial resources have been exhausted, and in particular the mechanism of variation margin gains haircutting. This mechanism is considered in international standard-setters' guidance on recovery planning for CCPs and has been adopted by some CCPs.

In this paper, we further explore the simulation-based household stress-testing model presented in Bilston and Rodgers (2013). This model uses data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey to quantify the household sector's financial resilience to macroeconomic shocks. The model suggests that through the 2000s the household sector remained resilient to scenarios involving asset price, interest rate and unemployment rate shocks, and the associated increases in household loan losses under these scenarios were limited. Indeed, the results suggest that, despite rising levels of household indebtedness in aggregate, the distribution of household debt has remained concentrated among households that are well placed to service it. In turn, this suggests that aggregate measures of household indebtedness may be misleading indicators of the household sector's financial fragility. The results also highlight the potential for expansionary monetary policy to offset the effects of increases in unemployment and decreases in asset prices on household loan losses."

 """,2014.,The Evolution of Payment Costs in Australia,"rdp2014-14, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper examines the costs borne by financial institutions, merchants, and consumers in making, facilitating and accepting consumer-to-business payments. It examines the resource costs incurred by these sectors, how these have changed since 2006, and how fees and other transfers determine which sectors ultimately bear these costs. It also examines how resource costs vary at different transaction sizes and, for merchants, how costs differ between small and large entities. The results suggest that the resource costs of the payments system have fallen as a per cent of GDP since 2006. On a per transaction basis, direct debit remains the lowest-cost payment instrument while cheques remain the most expensive. At the point of sale, payments using cash, eftpos and contactless MasterCard & Visa debit cards have broadly similar costs for transactions under about $20; above $20, eftpos is the lowest-cost payment method. The results indicate that the relationship between resource and private costs varies significantly across instruments. The greater share of the overall cost is borne by merchants. The consumer undertaking a transaction typically pays a small proportion of its cost; consumers face a similar cost for credit card payments as for debit card payments despite the higher cost of credit cards to the economy. Finally, the results suggest that small businesses incur higher costs than large merchants."

We use two complementary micro-level datasets: loan-level data on residential mortgages from two Australian banks, which we use to analyse the factors associated with entering 90+ day housing loan arrears; and household-level data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, which we use to explore the factors associated with households missing mortgage payments. The loan-level analysis indicates that the probability of entering arrears increases with the loan-to-valuation ratio (LVR) at origination, and is particularly high for loans with an LVR above 90 per cent. In contrast, the probability of entering arrears is lower for loans that are repaid relatively quickly. Additionally, the probability of entering arrears varies across different loan types; for example, low-documentation loans are more likely to enter arrears, even after controlling for whether the borrower was self-employed. The likelihood of entering arrears increases with the contract interest rate, which is consistent with lenders setting higher interest rates for riskier borrowers. The household-level analysis suggests that the probability of missing a mortgage payment is particularly high for households with relatively high debt-servicing ratios. Households that have previously missed a payment are also much more likely to miss subsequent payments than households with unblemished payment histories."

The mining, manufacturing, personal services, construction and business services industries are the most exchange rate sensitive sectors of the economy. In the context of the boom in the terms of trade over the past decade, we use our model to explore how the Australian economy might have evolved under alternative scenarios. These suggest that real exchange rate movements over the past decade have had a broadly stabilising effect on the domestic economy and can largely be explained by economic fundamentals."

We find evidence to suggest that average prices of dwellings sold at auction are informative for forecasting growth in average private-treaty prices and average sales prices overall. In contrast, we find little evidence to suggest that dwellings sold through private-treaty are similarly informative. Interpreting these results using two models of price determination – an English auction where buyer values are positively correlated, and inferred through the auction process, and a private-treaty sale where the price is determined by a Nash bargain – we find that auction prices better reflect a common trend in prices and are therefore more useful when forecasting. In contrast, private-treaty prices are affected by shocks that are specific to that mechanism of trade, such as changes in the relative strength of the bargaining positions of buyers and sellers, or changes to the dispersion of valuations. These shocks appear to reduce the usefulness of private-treaty prices for forecasting or measuring short-run movements in the common price trend."

As conventional measures of international trade do not fully capture the impact of global supply chains, we present complementary estimates of value-added trade for Australia. These value-added trade estimates suggest that the United States and Europe are more important for export demand than implied by conventional trade statistics, as some Australian content is exported to those locations indirectly via east Asia. The estimates also highlight the importance of the services sector to Australian trade, as the services sector is integral to producing goods exports. We also find that, compared to thirty years ago, Australian production now involves more stages of production, a greater share of production occurs overseas, and more production occurs towards the start of the supply chain. For Australia, these structural adjustments mainly occurred during the 1990s, and we provide evidence that similar adjustments have occurred elsewhere in the world driven by several factors, including lower international trade costs, deregulation of markets that produce intermediate goods and services, and economic development in emerging economies, such as China."

We argue this is a useful criterion for assessing housing overvaluation. We use a new Australian dataset, which includes prices and rents for matched properties, letting us value housing in levels. We find that if real house prices grow at their historical average pace, then owning a home is about as expensive as renting. If prices grow more slowly, as some forecasters predict, the framework used in this paper suggests that the average home buyer would be financially better off renting. We decompose house prices into contributions from rents, interest rates and expected capital gains, which may help policymakers in the detection of housing bubbles. Recent data do not show signs of a bubble."

The survey used a diary and end-of-survey questionnaire to collect data on the use of cash, cards and a range of other payment methods, both at the point of sale and via remote channels (online, mail and telephone). The 2013 data show that cash and cheque use has continued to fall. The use of cards has risen significantly, and there has also been an increase in the use of PayPal. The growth in the use of cards and the reduction in cash use are evident across households in all age and household income groups. The strong growth in remote payments is one contributor to the observed change in the use of cash and cards. However, the main contribution is from the increased use of cards at the point of sale, which is likely to reflect both growth in the availability of card terminals at merchants and changing consumer preferences as authentication methods have evolved. In particular, we find some indication that the adoption of contactless technology, which lowers the tender time of card payments at the point of sale, may have increased card use. The paper presents detailed information about the use of contactless card and smartphone payments by demographic group and payment type. It also provides an update on the payment of surcharges on card payments, including information about the value of card surcharges that were paid by consumers, and the payment of ATM fees."

Household characteristics, such as age and tenure, and the regional unemployment rate are correlated with differences between beliefs and prices. We also find evidence that the difference between beliefs and prices has explanatory power for average household consumption, leverage and portfolio decisions after controlling for the market-inferred value of the home.

Our results explaining differences in saving behaviour across households are consistent with theory and previous findings. As might be expected, households' saving ratios tend to increase with income, but decrease with wealth and gearing. Financially constrained and migrant households tend to save more than other households, all else equal. While saving differs substantially across age groups we find that, at least in part, this reflects differing circumstances. Our results suggest that the rise in household saving between 2003/04 and 2009/10 was driven by changes in the saving behaviour associated with certain household characteristics, rather than changes in characteristics: households with less secure income and/or those vulnerable to asset price shocks, higher-educated households, younger households with debt and older households with wealth increased their propensity to save. While our results inform which households changed their saving behaviour, we are unable to definitively conclude what caused this change in behaviour. Our interpretation of these results is that precautionary saving motives, a reduction in future income expectations for higher-educated households, an effort to rebuild wealth after the financial crisis and changing attitudes to debt contributed to the rise in the household saving ratio, although other interpretations of the data are possible."

We also find that spillovers to broader economic activity, including changes in domestic production, non-resource exports and consumption, are all greater in the presence of exploration activity.

I show that the companies that were forced to refinance or repay a relatively large share of debt in 2008/09 reduced inventory investment by significantly more than companies that were due to refinance or repay their debt at some other time.

Our model shows that CCP links can reduce overall system exposure in most plausible scenarios. This conclusion is robust to changes in assumptions about the nature of participants and their exposures, as well as to the existence of more than two linked CCPs."

We find that structural breaks in the means of the series can often change the properties of instruments a great deal, and may well be a bigger source of small-sample bias than that due to specification error. Moreover, we also find that the direction of the specification bias is not predictable. It is necessary to check for weak instruments before deciding that the magnitude of any estimator bias reflects specification errors coming from structural change."

Alongside times of high volatility, however, these economies also experience periods in which their terms of trade are comparatively stable. We estimate the empirical process for the terms of trade for six small open economies and examine the responses of output, the current account and prices to changes in terms of trade volatility using a vector autoregression (VAR). We find that increased terms of trade volatility, by itself, is associated with a contraction in domestic demand and an increase in the current account. We then set up a small open economy real business cycle model and show that it can broadly replicate the responses to a volatility shock estimated in the VAR. We use this model to explore the sectoral implications of terms of trade volatility shocks and to quantify the importance of these shocks as a source of business cycle fluctuations. Our results suggest that the direct effects of terms of trade volatility shocks on output, consumption and investment are generally small. But, interacted with shocks to the level of the terms of trade, volatility shocks account for around one-quarter of the total impact of the terms of trade on macroeconomic outcomes."

I set up a small open economy model in which agents have imperfect information about the persistence of terms of trade shocks and estimate the parameters of the model using Australian data. The results point to the existence of large informational frictions. In fact, agents' beliefs about the future path of the terms of trade following transitory and permanent shocks are almost identical. However, the results also suggest that incomplete information causes agents to respond more cautiously to terms of trade shocks. Consequently, consumption, output and the trade balance are less volatile under incomplete information than they are under full information."

We claim that a similar performance can be achieved without resorting to market incompleteness. We show that a model with complete markets driven by productivity shocks alone can account for the 'international co-movement puzzle'. Our model features time non-separable preferences that allow arbitrarily small changes in wealth to affect the supply of labour. It matches the data by predicting (i) positive cross-country correlations of investment and hours worked; and (ii) realistic cross-country correlations of consumption. It reduces the gap between international correlations of output and consumption, but fails to change their order. Unlike models with restricted international markets, ours shows little sensitivity to the parameterisation of the forcing process."

The resulting BVAR-DSGE model partially relaxes the relationships in the DSGE so as to fit the data better. However, their approach does not accommodate the typical restriction of small open economy models which ensures that developments in the small economy cannot affect the large economy. I develop a method that allows this restriction to be imposed and introduce a simple way, suitable for small open economies, of identifying the empirical BVAR-DSGE using information from the DSGE model. These methods are demonstrated using the Justiniano and Preston (2010a) DSGE model.

However, there has been surprisingly little formal testing for the existence of a credit crunch in the context of the US housing market. In this paper I examine whether the fall in mortgage credit over 2007–2008 was caused by a reduction in credit supply which, in turn, can be traced to a fall in the amount of financing available to mortgage lenders. I use the differential exposures of individual mortgage lenders to the collapse of the securitisation market in 2007 as a source of cross-lender variation in lender financing conditions and assess the impact on residential mortgage lending. Using loan-level information to control for unobservable credit demand shocks, I show that mortgage lenders that were particularly reliant on loan securitisation disproportionately reduced the supply of mortgage credit. The negative liquidity shock caused by the shutdown of the securitisation market explains a significant share of the aggregate decline in mortgage credit during this crisis."

Identifying differences in behaviour across households of different ages helps to distinguish among these hypotheses. Younger homeowners exhibit the largest home-price wealth effects, with a 3 to 4 cent increase in spending per dollar increase in home price. As young homeowners are more likely to be credit constrained, their relatively large marginal propensity to spend supports hypothesis (2) as an important determinant of the co-movement between home prices and household spending. Further, the non-response of young renters to changes in home prices argues against hypothesis (3)."

 """,2013.,Implications for the Australian Economy of Strong Growth in Asia,"rdp2013-03, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Strong growth in Asia, particularly in China, has had a profound impact on the Australian economy over the past decade. Most notable so far has been the boom in the resource sector, with commodity prices and hence Australia's terms of trade rising to historically high levels over a number of years. This has been accompanied by a sizeable appreciation of the exchange rate. While the terms of trade have passed their peak, the substantial investment in productive capacity of the resource sector in recent years is expected to provide a large boost to the production and exports of resources in coming years. In this paper we describe how the pattern of structural adjustment to the positive terms of trade shock has, to date, proceeded broadly in line with that suggested by a simple theoretical model that distinguishes between three broadly defined sectors: the resource sector, the 'other tradable' sector and the non-tradable sector. In particular, relative wages and prices adjusted in a way that facilitated the reallocation of factors of production towards the resource sector. While not all parts of the economy have benefited, the process of adjustment thus far has occurred relatively smoothly in a macroeconomic sense; inflation has remained within the target range, or not too far from it, unemployment has remained relatively low and output has grown at close to trend rates. This stands in stark contrast to some earlier episodes of terms of trade booms in Australia. We argue that macroeconomic adjustment to the current terms of trade shock has been facilitated by the appreciation of the exchange rate, the anchoring of inflation expectations and labour market dynamics whereby wage pressures in industries or regions experiencing strong conditions associated with the boom in resource investment have not spilled over to parts of the economy experiencing weaker conditions."

Extending the methodology of Kouparitsas (2011), we estimate the size, growth rate, and industry value-added content of a broad measure of the 'resource economy', which is defined to include all final demand related to resource extraction and investment. Under certain productivity assumptions, we also estimate the amount of labour that is required by each industry to service the demand for Australia's natural resources. We estimate that the resource economy accounted for around 18 per cent of gross value added (GVA) in 2011/12, which is double its share of the economy in 2003/04. Of this, the resource extraction sector – which we define to include the mining industry and resource-specific manufacturing – directly accounted for 11½ per cent of GVA. The remaining 6½ per cent of GVA can be attributed to the value added of industries that provide inputs to resource extraction and investment, such as business services, construction, transport and manufacturing. This 'resource-related' activity is significantly more labour intensive than resource extraction, accounting for an estimated 6¾ per cent of total employment in 2011/12, compared with 3¼ per cent for the resource extraction sector."

Nevertheless, demand for currency increased abnormally quickly in late 2008, resulting in an additional $5 billion (or 12 per cent) of Australian banknotes on issue by the end of that year. The rise in currency demand began in mid October 2008, around four weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and concurrently with policy responses of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Federal Government. The surge in currency demand did not have any destabilising effect on the banking system – indeed bank deposits also rose during the period. However, the rise in currency demand did raise some issues for the RBA's banknote distribution operations. Traditional methods of currency demand suggest a role for interest rate reductions and the Federal Government stimulus payments to households in explaining the increase in currency holdings. We estimate that these factors can only account for around 20 per cent of the observed increase in currency holdings. The remainder of the rise could be due to an increase in precautionary holdings by people concerned about the liquidity or solvency of financial institutions and by financial institutions as a contingency. This is consistent with the disproportionate rise in demand for high-denomination banknotes at this time."

These developments have largely been due to: the evolution of the structure of the Australian economy; privatisations; and changes in the regulatory landscape, particularly the deregulation of the banking system in the 1980s, and the floating of the exchange rate and abolition of capital controls in 1983."

In practice, the impact of structural change on estimation is often addressed by selecting a sub-sample of the data for which a time-invariant structure seems valid. In this paper we develop solutions for linearised models in the presence of structural changes using a variety of assumptions relating to agents' beliefs when forming expectations, and whether the structural changes are known in advance. The solutions can be put into state space form and the Kalman filter used for constructing the likelihood function. Structural changes and varying beliefs trigger movements in the reduced-form coefficients and hence model variables follow a time-varying coefficient VAR. We apply the techniques to two examples: a disinflation program and a transitory slowdown in trend growth."

 """,2012.,The Impact of Payment System Design on Tiering Incentives,"rdp2012-06, Reserve Bank of Australia.",Tiering occurs when an institution does not participate directly in the central payment system but instead settles its payments through an agent. A high level of tiering can be a significant issue for payment system regulators because of the increased credit and concentration risk. This paper explores the impact of payment system design on institutions' incentives to tier using simulation analysis. Some evidence is found to support the hypothesis that the liquidity-saving mechanisms in Australia's real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system – the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS) – reduce the liquidity cost of direct participation. This may have contributed to the low level of tiering in RITS relative to RTGS systems in other countries. We find no clear relationship between system design and the size of the substantial two-way exposures tiering creates between clients and their settlement banks. Our data suggest that more tiering would result in only small increases to the level of concentration in RITS.

Such 'hybrid features' have the potential to mitigate the systemic impact of operational disruptions of participants. This paper simulates operational disruptions of participants, using data from Australia's RTGS system – the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS) – to analyse the effect of these hybrid features on the systemic impact of such disruptions. The results suggest that the bilateral-offset algorithm and sub-limit feature in RITS generally mitigate the impact of a participant's operational disruption, even if there is less liquidity committed to the RTGS system. The hybrid features of the Australian RTGS system also mean that the size of the participant with the operational disruption has less effect on the systemic impact of that disruption than otherwise. While a central queue, in and of itself, would tend to mitigate the impact of a participant's operational disruption, methodological issues make it difficult to draw any conclusions regarding this hybrid feature in this paper."

 """,2012.,"ATM Fees, Pricing and Consumer Behaviour: An Analysis of ATM Network Reform in Australia","rdp2012-03, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Automated teller machine (ATM) networks are a key component of payments systems. A number of competing theoretical models have been developed to examine fees associated with ATM transactions. A common feature of these models is that they imply that the elimination of interchange fees will cause a one-for-one increase in direct fees and a one-for-one fall in foreign fees, leaving the price of foreign ATM transactions unchanged in the short run. This prediction is not entirely consistent with recent experience in Australia. Following reform of the Australian ATM network in March 2009 that eliminated interchange fees, the total price of foreign ATM transactions was unchanged but the adjustment in foreign and direct fees was almost twice as large as the eliminated interchange fee. This paper addresses this discrepancy by developing a model of ATM fees that can explain this feature of the Australian experience and also explicitly models various ATM usage costs often ignored in the literature. However, this approach to modelling ATM fees, and the approach taken in the existing literature, cannot explain a striking feature of the Australian experience – the shift in consumer behaviour away from foreign ATM use – and two potential explanations for the observed behaviour are proposed."

 """,2012.,The Role of Credit Supply in the Australian Economy,"rdp2012-02, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Historical experience shows that disruptions in credit markets can have a material impact on activity and inflation. However, it is hard to measure such effects owing to the difficulty in isolating credit supply shocks. This paper employs survey data to identify the impact of credit supply shocks in Australia over the past three decades, using a structural vector autoregression approach. We estimate that a one standard deviation shock to the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance (a 'credit supply shock') reduces Australian GDP by almost ⅓ per cent after one year and gross national expenditure by nearly ½ per cent. The effect on business credit is larger and more persistent, with credit declining by nearly 1 per cent relative to its baseline after two and a half years. During the global financial crisis, the cumulative impact of credit supply shocks is estimated to have contributed to a reduction in GDP of 1 per cent (in mid 2009). While credit supply shocks had a notable effect on GDP during the global financial crisis, this credit event appears to have been shorter and sharper than that experienced during the period of financial instability in the early 1990s. Consistent with a 'credit channel' of monetary policy transmission, an unexpected tightening of monetary policy results in a significant increase in the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance. We also find effects consistent with a financial accelerator mechanism, whereby an improvement in balance sheets results in easier credit conditions and higher GDP and business credit. Altogether, these results suggest that credit market developments have been an integral aspect of the business cycle in Australia since financial deregulation in the 1980s."

In this paper we use a panel vector autoregression (panel VAR) model to investigate possible explanations of this co-movement for the G7 economies. Shocks to commodity prices are found to be more important than common movements in real activity as a driver of 'global inflation' dynamics. However, commodity prices and common real activity cannot explain all of the co-movement in inflation. Even when controlling for these factors, a common indicator of inflation still offers explanatory power for domestic inflation in the panel VAR. Given the role of global inflation in explaining inflation in the G7 countries, we then consider the significance of global inflation for Australian inflation. We find that movements in international inflation offer useful information when included in models of Australian inflation, particularly headline inflation."

With global supply unable to respond quickly, prices surged to historically high levels. In response, mining investment in Australia rose to record levels as a share of the economy by the end of the decade. The rise in commodity prices has boosted activity and incomes and encouraged the factors of production to shift towards the mining industry. The boom has also been associated with a large increase in the real exchange rate, affecting trade-exposed industries. Overall, Australia's macroeconomic performance during the decade was much more stable than during the earlier mining booms, reflecting a stronger institutional framework."

Three types of shocks are identified based on their impact on commodity prices, global manufactured prices, and global economic activity. The first two shocks, a world demand shock and a commodity-market specific shock are fairly standard. The third shock, a globalisation shock that may result, for instance, from the increasing importance of China, India and eastern Europe in the global economy is more novel. The globalisation shock is associated with a decline in manufactured prices, a rise in commodity prices, and an increase in global economic activity. Determining the underlying source of variation in the terms of trade is shown to be important for understanding the impact on the Australian economy as all three shocks propagate through the economy in different ways. The relative contribution of each shock to inflation, output, interest rates, and the exchange rate has also varied over time. The main conclusion of the paper is that a higher terms of trade tends to be expansionary but is not always inflationary. A key result is that the floating exchange rate has provided an important buffer to the external shocks that move the terms of trade."

This paper proposes that two useful ways to evaluate such models are by focusing on their implications for business cycle characteristics and whether the models can match several stylised facts about the impact of financial conditions. One of these facts is that credit crises produce long-duration recessions. We find that while in the Gilchrist et al (2009) model financial factors can impact on particular cycles, they do little change to the average cycle characteristics.

Further, while long-term inflation expectations are generally stable, inflation risk premia are much more volatile.

This paper provides evidence that Chinaâ€™s (mainly manufacturing) exports have been a significant driver of its demand for resource commodities over recent decades. First, it employs input-output tables to demonstrate that, historically, manufacturing has been at least as important as construction as a driver of Chinaâ€™s demand for resource-intensive metal products. Second, it shows that global trade in non-oil resource commodities can be described by the gravity model of trade. Using this model it is found that, controlling for domestic expenditure (including investment), exports are a sizeable and significant determinant of a countryâ€™s resource imports, and that this has been true for China as well as for other countries."

This is in contrast to models that use recursive zero-type restrictions, for which inflation can rise following an unexpected interest rate increase while the exchange rate can appreciate or depreciate depending on the ordering of the variables. However, central tendency measures of sign-restricted VAR models can be misleading and hardly ever coincide with the true impulses. This finding casts doubt on the common notion that the median impulses are the ‘most probable’ description of the true data generating process.

In particular, do changes in money have additional effects on aggregate demand outside of those induced by changes in short-term nominal interest rates? This paper revisits and reinterprets the empirical evidence based on single equation regressions which is quite mixed, with some results supporting and other results denying the existence of direct effects. We use a structural model with no direct effects of money to show that the finding of positive and statistically significant coefficients on real money growth can be misleading. The model generates data that, when used to estimate analogs of the empirical regressions, produce positive and statistically significant coefficients on real money growth, similar to those often found when using actual data. The problem is that single equation regressions leave out a set of variables, which in turn, gives rise to an omitted variables bias in the estimated coefficients on real money growth. Hence, they are an unreliable guide to calibrate monetary policies, in general, including at the zero lower bound."

To explore this further, the paper examines whether the broadening in employment reflects an improvement in the relative employment prospects of the unemployed or of those outside of the labour force (which includes the ‘marginally attached’ and those who can be more strictly described as being ‘not in the labour force’). Estimates of a multinomial logit model imply that the improvement in the relative employment prospects of those outside of the labour force was the more important effect. In particular, between 2002 and 2006, the concentration of ‘low employment’ characteristics decreased among people who are only marginally attached and those not in the labour force, suggesting that the strong employment growth was especially beneficial for these groups. In contrast, the concentration of ‘low employment’ characteristics in the unemployment pool was broadly unchanged."

We find that traditional models, such as the expectations-augmented standard Phillips curve or mark-up models, outperform the more micro-founded New-Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) in explaining trimmed mean inflation, both in terms of in-sample fit and significance of coefficients. This in large part reflects the weak instruments problem in the estimation of the NKPC, and is partly corrected by including a direct measure of inflation expectations, but we still find that the unemployment rate or growth in marginal costs (unit labour cost and import prices) provides a better fit than either the output gap or level of real marginal costs. These traditional models also perform well in out-of-sample tests, relative to alternative models and some common benchmarks, with the standard Phillips curve clearly superior to these benchmarks on this test. As inflation has become better anchored and hence less variable, the magnitude of the errors of the single-equation models has declined, although the explanatory power (in terms of R-squared) has fallen together with this greater stability. We also investigate the empirical importance of some other variables that are commonly cited as determinants of inflation, and find little evidence that either commodity prices or the growth rate of money directly influence Australian underlying inflation."

Over recent years, a lot of theoretical and applied macroeconomic research has been based on the assumption of rational expectations. However, estimated models based on this assumption typically fail to capture the dynamics of the economy unless mechanical sources of persistence, such as habit formation in consumption and/or indexation to past prices, are imposed. This paper develops and estimates a small open economy model for Australia assuming two different types of expectations: rational expectations and learning. Learning – where expectations are formed by extrapolating from the historical data – can be an alternative means to generate the persistence observed in the data. The paper has four key findings. First, learning does not reduce the importance of conventional mechanical forms of persistence. Second, despite this, the model with learning is able to generate real exchange rate dynamics that are consistent with empirical models but which are absent in standard theoretical models. Third, there is some tentative evidence that learning is preferred over rational expectations in terms of fitting the data. Fourth, since the adoption of inflation targeting, agents appear to be using a longer history of data to form their expectations, consistent with greater stability of inflation."

The paper shows that in the presence of this heterogeneity, estimates of aggregate price stickiness from microeconomic and macroeconomic data should differ. Heterogeneity in firms’ pricing decisions, as well as a more realistic production structure, is introduced into an otherwise standard New-Keynesian model. Using a model calibrated with microeconomic pricing survey data for Australia, the paper shows that estimates of the NKPC considerably overstate the true degree of price stickiness and may falsely suggest that some prices are indexed to past inflation. These problems arise because of a type of misspecification and a lack of suitable instruments."

The effect of US monetary policy shocks on relative prices was most pronounced in countries that fix their currency to the US dollar. Those countries that float were largely shielded from these effects.

The same is true of financial market development in the case of output volatility. Using data on the expenditure components of GDP, the channels through which terms of trade shocks affect output are examined.

We find that participation in a loyalty program and access to an interest-free period, both of which lower the price of credit card use, tend to increase credit card use at the expense of alternative payment methods, such as debit cards and cash. Specifically, we find that a loyalty program increases the probability of credit card use by 23 percentage points and access to the interest-free period increases the probability by 16 percentage points. Interestingly, the pattern of substitution from cash and debit cards is different in each of these cases. A loyalty program reduces the probability of cash use by 14 percentage points and has little effect on debit card use, while access to the interest-free period has little effect on cash use but reduces the probability of debit card use by 19 percentage points. We find these effects to be economically significant and large enough that they can help to explain observed aggregate payments patterns. An implication is that the Reserve Bank reforms of the Australian payments system are likely to have influenced observed payment patterns."

Our results confirm that while this finding generally holds when platforms charge both consumers and merchants on a purely per-transaction basis, it need not hold in the more realistic situation where platforms instead levy flat fees on consumers.

This result illustrates how examination of ‘instrument rules’ may hide important trade-offs facing policy-makers that are incorporated in ‘targeting rules’. The model is a modified version of Clarida, Galí and Gertler’s (2002). The key change is to allow pricing to market or local-currency pricing and consider the policy implications of currency misalignments. Besides highlighting the importance of the currency misalignment, this model also gives a rationale for targeting CPI inflation, rather than producer price inflation as in Clarida, Galí and Gertler."

Consequently, credible announcements that entail future changes of the structure cannot be handled by standard solution methods. This paper develops the solution for linear stochastic rational expectations models in the face of a finite sequence of anticipated structural changes. These events encompass anticipated changes to the structural parameters and anticipated additive shocks. We apply the solution technique to some examples of practical relevance to monetary policy."

 """,2008.,A Term Structure Decomposition of the Australian Yield Curve,"rdp2008-09, Reserve Bank of Australia.","We use data on coupon-bearing Australian Government bonds and overnight indexed swap (OIS) rates to estimate risk-free zero-coupon yield and forward curves for Australia from 1992 to 2007. These curves, and analysts’ forecasts of future interest rates, are then used to fit an affine term structure model to Australian interest rates, with the aim of decomposing forward rates into expected future overnight cash rates plus term premia. The expected future short rates derived from the model are on average unbiased, fluctuating around the average of actual observed short rates. Since the adoption of inflation targeting and the entrenchment of low and stable inflation expectations, term premia appear to have declined in levels and displayed smaller fluctuations in response to economic shocks. This suggests that the market has become less uncertain about the path of future interest rates. Towards the end of the sample period, term premia have been negative, suggesting that investors may have been willing to pay a premium for Commonwealth Government securities. Due to the complexity of the model and the difficulty of calibrating it to data, the results should not be interpreted too precisely. Nevertheless, the model does provide a potentially useful decomposition of recent changes in the expected path of interest rates and term premia."

In some respects, this can be thought of as a market failure. This paper addresses how best to promote asset market liquidity given this market failure, and the appropriate balance between the private and public sectors in establishing arrangements for dealing with liquidity problems. There are three main conclusions. First, improvements in the financial infrastructure – including arrangements for disclosure and post-trade processing – have a role to play in limiting the sharp rise in information asymmetries that can occur when conditions in financial markets are strained and at turning points in the financial cycle. Second, recent events have shown up shortcomings in the way that financial institutions manage their own liquidity, and these shortcomings need addressing. Third, it may be welfare-improving for the public sector to provide liquidity services when liquidity is strained. The central bank can smooth liquidity over the cycle, and the public sector can facilitate the change of ownership of assets from a troubled institution, which in extremis may include the public sector buying assets outright. If the public sector does actively provide liquidity services, then arrangements need to be put in place to ensure that the potential welfare gains from doing so are not undermined by financial institutions taking on greater risk than is warranted."

Three classes of models are considered: a Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR), a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) and a medium-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. Using Australian data over the inflation-targeting period, we find that, at short forecast horizons, the Bayesian VAR model is assigned the most weight, while at intermediate and longer horizons the factor model is preferred. The DSGE model is assigned little weight at all horizons, a result that can be attributed to the DSGE model producing density forecasts that are very wide when compared with the actual distribution of observations. While a density forecast evaluation exercise reveals little formal evidence that the optimally combined densities are superior to those from the best-performing individual model, or a simple equal-weighting scheme, this may be a result of the short sample available."

The inertial behaviour of inflation is driven by privately informed firms strategically ‘herding’ on the public information contained in the observations of lagged aggregate variables. The model also matches the average duration between price changes found in the data and it nests the standard new Keynesian Phillips curve as a special case. To solve the model, the paper derives an algorithm for solving a class of dynamic models with higher-order expectations."

This paper reviews the main drivers of Australian business investment through a discussion of some long- and short-run trends and estimation of error-correction models for its main components. Two innovations are introduced in the modelling approach. The first is that investment in computing equipment is excluded from the models, recognising that it cannot be treated in the same way as other types of investment, particularly in light of the dramatic falls in its relative price over recent decades. The second is that standard techniques are used to exclude influential observations when modelling the short-run variation in the data as a means of accounting for the considerable volatility in these variables. This improves the robustness of the estimation. The different types of investment – equipment, building and engineering – are found to be influenced by their own idiosyncratic factors, though for each type of investment, an inverse relationship between the investment-to-output ratio and its corresponding measure of the cost of capital is found."

Policy-makers have generally assumed that by introducing pre-funded pension schemes, they can increase household wealth and thereby raise retirement incomes. However, there has been relatively little empirical work to confirm this. This paper focuses on the effect of Australia’s system of compulsory pension accounts, the ‘Superannuation Guarantee’, on household saving behaviour. Microeconomic data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, are used to explore three related questions: i. Have compulsory pension accounts increased household wealth? ii. What effect do compulsory pension accounts have on voluntary saving for retirement? iii. Do compulsory pension accounts influence the timing of retirement? This paper finds that Australia’s compulsory pension accounts increased household wealth. Voluntary saving for retirement in pension accounts also appeared to increase slightly, possibly due to the added convenience of being able to make contributions directly into these pension accounts. Finally, there is no evidence of a significant effect on retirement intentions. Overall, the results suggest that Australia’s compulsory pension accounts have increased household wealth and raised self-funded retirement incomes."

However, the extent of credit constraints may be at least as important, if not more so. In particular, monetary policy could have a larger impact on aggregate demand when credit constraints are pervasive (which could be the case at low or high levels of indebtedness, or both). This paper examines the extent to which the strength of credit growth, which can be seen as a proxy for credit constraints, may affect the transmission of monetary policy in a way that cannot be captured in linear models. The results reveal that GDP growth is more responsive to interest rate shocks when credit growth is low. Separate models for household and business credit growth confirm this finding: consumption and business investment are more responsive to interest rate shocks when credit is growing slowly for the household and business sectors, respectively."

In the canonical sticky-price small open economy model, we find that indeterminacy arising in the large economy can increase the volatility of the small economy. Our main finding, however, is that ‘smallness’ is a property of the unique rational expectations equilibrium of the large economy, and not a general property of the small open economy model. If the large economy fails to anchor expectations, shocks to the small economy can affect the large one. This form of indeterminacy gives rise to a ‘butterfly effect’. Additional assumptions are required to preserve the ‘smallness’ of the small economy."

This has been accompanied by a trend increase in labour force participation (LFP) for women and more recently for men. Microeconomic data show a clear positive correlation between indebtedness and LFP. This paper models the LFP decision of prime-age Australian women and men accounting for the influence of debt and assets along with a range of other variables found to be important in the literature. The potential two-way causation between debt and labour supply is also addressed. Data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey are used as it contains recent and detailed data on household wealth along with extensive labour market and demographic data. A cross-section model of LFP is estimated using the detailed measures of household debts and assets available in Wave 2 of the survey. In addition, a panel model, using only measures of owner-occupied housing debt and assets, is estimated using all five currently available waves. Evidence is presented to suggest that LFP is determined by several factors, including family structure, education, health and indebtedness. In general, most of the effect of indebtedness on an individual’s probability of participation in the labour force is captured through the household debt-servicing ratio, although the level of owner-occupied mortgage debt appears important for men. Also, the panel results suggest that accounting for unobserved heterogeneity across individuals is important when examining the influence of debt on labour supply."

While noting that the results are sensitive to the measure of labour market regulation used, we find some support for the hypothesis that lower initial levels of regulation are associated with higher TFP growth over subsequent years, and that labour and product market deregulation have more of an effect in combination.

In practice, however, the advantages of using large panels of data to construct the factors typically comes at the cost of using less timely series, thereby delaying when the forecasts can be made. To produce more timely forecasts it is possible to use a narrower data panel, though this will possibly result in less accurate factor estimates and so less accurate forecasts. We demonstrate this trade-off between accuracy and timeliness with out-of-sample forecasts. With the exception of only consumer price inflation, the forecasts do not become less accurate as they utilise less information by excluding less timely series. So while factor forecasts have large data requirements, we show that these should not prevent their practical use when timely forecasts are needed."

Historical experience under a fixed exchange rate regime suggested that large persistent deficits were unsustainable and could leave the economy vulnerable to sudden reversals in sentiment. These concerns persisted after the floating of the Australian dollar and financial deregulation, and it was thought that all arms of policy should help to rein in the then much larger current account deficits. However, these policies were shown to be ineffective and, by the early 1990s, the argument that current account deficits represent the optimal outcomes of decisions made by ‘consenting adults’ gained wide support. This paper presents some empirical evidence consistent with optimal smoothing in the face of temporary shocks; the persistence of the deficit is attributed to a modest degree of impatience relative to the rest of the world. Although it is now widely accepted that policy should not seek to influence the current account balance, the issue of external vulnerability remains of interest. Here, country-specific considerations are important, and it is argued that the factors that have made Australia relatively resilient to external shocks are also those that helped to attract foreign capital in the first place."

In a closed economy, the optimal policy is a ‘Taylor rule’ in which the interest rate depends on output and inflation. In an open economy, the optimal rule changes in two ways. First, the policy instrument is a ‘Monetary Conditions Index’ – a weighted average of the interest rate and the exchange rate. Second, on the right side of the rule, inflation is replaced by ‘long-run inflation’, a variable that filters out the transitory effects of exchange-rate movements. The model also implies that pure inflation targeting is dangerous in an open economy, because it creates large fluctuations in exchange rates and output. Targeting long-run inflation avoids this problem and produces a close approximation to the optimal instrument rule."

To do this we use new confidential bank-level data covering about 1,500 banks operating in 10 banking systems, with most samples spanning the two decades up to the end of 2019. Our analysis confirms the empirical regularity that declining interest rates reduce banks' net interest margins. However, we find a smaller effect than in previous studies: on average across countries, a 100 basis point fall in short-term interest rates results in a 5 basis point decline in net interest margins in the short run. Notably, there are substantial cross-country differences, and, in some cases, the estimated effect is greater. Importantly, the effect of lower interest rates on net interest margins is larger than the effect on assets returns, suggesting that banks can shield overall profitability in the face of lower interest rates. For example, lower interest rates alleviate debt-servicing burdens and are associated with a fall in provisions set aside to cover losses on loans. There is therefore no one-size-fits-all result for the impact of low interest rates on overall profitability: in some jurisdictions banks maintained their level of profitability as the beneficial impact of lower rates on loan-loss provisions and other factors, including an increased focus on cost efficiencies and streamlining business models, materially offset the drag from lower interest margins."

It approaches the problem of determining underlying inflation from a different direction than previous methods. Rather than excluding or trimming out volatile CPI items, it smoothes components of the CPI based on their volatility – CPI expenditure weights are maintained for all items. Items such as rent are smoothed a little, if at all, while volatile series such as fruit, vegetables and automotive fuel are smoothed a lot. This removes much of the temporary volatility in the CPI while retaining most of the persistent signal. Because our underlying inflation measure includes all CPI items at all times, it is robust to sustained relative price changes and is unbiased in the long run. A potential cost of this approach is that, unlike other measures, it places weight on lagged as well as contemporaneous prices for volatile series. An evaluation of the balance between the costs and benefits of this approach remains an open question."

Overall, we find that trimmed means tend to outperform headline and exclusion measures on a range of different criteria, indicating that they can be thought of as having better signal-to-noise ratios. We also find that there is a wide range of trims that perform well. One innovation for the United States is to break up the large implicit rent component in the US CPI into four regional components, which improves the performance of trimmed means, especially large trims such as the weighted median. The results lend support to the use of trimmed means as useful measures of underlying inflation at the current juncture where the growth of China and other emerging markets is having two offsetting effects on global inflation. Whereas some central banks have tended to focus on headline inflation and others have focused more on exclusion measures, our results provide some justification for a middle path, namely using trimmed mean measures which deal with outliers at both ends of the distribution of price changes in a symmetric manner."

This paper examines the available evidence on the nature and extent of this hedging behaviour. Related to this, Australia’s net foreign liability position is often cited as a vulnerability of the Australian economy to exchange rate depreciation.

However, there has been little disaggregated information on how equity is being withdrawn and injected, the characteristics of households altering housing equity, and how funds from withdrawn equity are being used. This paper uses a survey of 4 500 households commissioned by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to address these questions. The results suggest that, during 2004, the most common method of withdrawing equity was for a household to increase the level of debt secured against a property they already owned. In contrast, most of the value of equity withdrawn was associated with property transactions, with the typical property transaction resulting in a net equity withdrawal. Turnover in the property market is therefore likely to be an important driver of cycles in aggregate housing equity withdrawal. Bivariate and logit analysis suggests a significant life-cycle influence, with the bulk of equity withdrawal being undertaken by older households, while younger households typically inject, primarily through mortgage repayments or deposits for property purchase. Finally, the results suggest that the bulk of the value of withdrawn equity was used to increase non-housing assets, although a significant proportion of households used the funds for consumption expenditure."

In these English-speaking countries, which share many similar institutional and cultural features, declines in household or personal saving appear to have been correlated with large capital gains and rapid financial innovation. An empirical investigation based on quarterly macroeconomic data indicates that gains in the valuation of asset holdings have indeed been important as a substitute for traditional household saving (that is, personal saving as defined in the national accounts) in these countries over the last decades, and in some cases that this effect has been intensifying through time. Existing studies analysing private saving have tended to either focus on individual countries, finding the importance of wealth effects in certain cases, or a panel of OECD countries in which other common factors tend to dominate the wealth effect. In the latter case, it is possible that the lack of a significant wealth effect could be attributable to heterogeneity across countries."

To gauge the economic implications of these demographic changes we calibrate the model to match key features of the Australian economy. With either a fall in fertility or a rise in longevity, population ageing increases capital intensity in the long run. When fertility and longevity operate together, the increase in capital intensity is more than additive, and the share of life spent in retirement stays roughly constant. The dynamic response of the economy is sensitive to the relative strength of the two factors that drive ageing."

The timeliness of bond market data allows for quicker responses of monetary policy to disturbances compared to the case when the central bank has to rely solely on collected aggregate data. The information content of the term structure creates a link between the bond market and the macroeconomy that is novel to the literature. To quantify the importance of the bond market as a source of information, the model is estimated on data for the United States and Australia using Bayesian methods. The empirical exercise suggests that there is some information in the US term structure that helps the Federal Reserve to identify shocks to the economy on a timely basis. Australian bond prices seem to be less informative than their US counterparts, perhaps because Australia is a relatively small and open economy."

 """,2006.,Measuring Housing Price Growth – Using Stratification to Improve Median-based Measures,"rdp2006-04, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Developments in housing prices are of interest to households, policy-makers and those involved in the housing industry. This has been the case both in Australia and in other countries where house price developments are having significant macroeconomic impacts. However, the construction of measures of city-wide or nationwide average housing prices is not a straightforward exercise. One problem is that the sample of dwellings transacted in any period may be far from random and the characteristics of the sample may change from period to period. As a result, widely used measures of growth in mean or median housing prices will reflect changes in the composition of dwellings sold as well as changes in demand and supply conditions. We demonstrate that median price measures in most major Australian capitals are significantly affected by such compositional change. In this paper, we propose a simple measure of house price growth that addresses the problem of compositional change by stratifying individual transactions into different groups. Our measure differs from those commonly used internationally in that we group small geographic regions (suburbs) according to the long-term average price level of dwellings in those regions, rather than just clustering smaller geographic regions into larger geographic regions. This produces a measure of price growth that substantially improves upon median price measures, and one that is highly correlated with more sophisticated (but more computationally intensive) measures.

 """,2006.,Australian House Prices: A Comparison of Hedonic and Repeat-sales Measures,"rdp2006-03, Reserve Bank of Australia.","House prices are intrinsically difficult to measure due to changes in the composition of properties sold through time and changes in the quality of housing. I provide an overview of the theoretical nature of these issues and consider how regression-based measures of house prices – hedonic and repeat-sales measures – can control for compositional and quality change. I then explore whether these regression-based alternatives can provide accurate estimates of pure house price changes in the Australian context. Using unit record data for Australia’s three largest cities – Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane – between 1993 and 2005, the results suggest that the two regression-based approaches provide similar estimates of the pure price change in housing. The measures are comparable in terms of statistical fit, with around half of the variation in prices growth (for those houses sold more than once) explained. The regression-based measures also produce similar estimates of pure price changes to those obtained by a mix-adjusted measure. However, all three measures behave quite differently from a simple median, implying that compositional change matters empirically. These results confirm that regression-based measures are likely to be a useful analytical tool when measuring pure house price changes in Australia."

The first type considers the possibility of adding longer-term rates to the list of variables the central bank reacts to in setting its short-term rate. The second type considers Taylor-type rules that are expressed in terms of interest rates of different maturities, which are operationally equivalent to more complex rules expressed in terms of the short-term rate. It is shown that both types of rules can give rise to a unique rational expectations equilibrium in large regions of the policy-parameter space. The normative evaluation shows that under certain preferences of the monetary authority, policy rules of the second type produce better results than the standard Taylor-type rule."

The panel approach is taken to assess whether the coefficient instability present in direct estimates of export elasticities can be alleviated by utilising the cross-state variation present in both manufactured exports and their determinants. Estimates of the price elasticity using this approach are found to be relatively robust to the use of the mean-group or fixed-effects panel estimation, and to a range of different export demand specifications. Income elasticity estimates are found to be stable across models, but sensitive to the inclusion of other variables. However, the degree of coefficient instability is not found to be significantly less in panel models than when using direct estimates, suggesting that direct estimation remains appropriate. The analysis is then extended to consider the role that domestic factors play in determining manufactured exports. In line with theory, it is found that domestic final demand and capacity utilisation are inversely related to manufactured exports."

Real sales growth is found to be a significant determinant of corporate investment. The user cost of capital, which incorporates both debt and equity financing costs, also appears to be an important determinant. The paper also explores the effects of cash flow on investment, allowing for the possibility that the availability of internal funding could significantly affect the investment of financially constrained firms. Cash flow is found to affect investment, though the effects appear more complicated than previously reported in empirical research using Australian data. One innovation of this study is that it distinguishes financially distressed firms from financially constrained firms. The presence of financially distressed firms appears to bias downwards the sensitivity of investment to cash flow. Once separate account has been taken of firms experiencing financial distress, and in contrast to theory, cash flow is found to matter for the investment of both financially constrained and unconstrained firms. Interestingly, the estimated degree of sensitivity appears to be roughly the same for both groups."

In addition, there may be a number of non-pecuniary benefits, including greater access to education, infrastructure and services. But these benefits are accompanied by an urban premium on house prices, thus possibly affecting the composition of the asset portfolios of households living in different locations. Using a recent cross-section of wealth data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey we test whether urbanisation, when controlling for other factors, has a significant effect on the share of assets that households hold in housing. For owner-occupiers, the effect is found to be significant and positive, suggesting that housing is more expensive in larger cities even once we allow for the higher incomes and asset holdings of these households. In fact, the effect is quite large with a 100 person per square kilometre increase in urbanisation increasing the share of assets held in the home by 0.4 percentage points, on average. Further, we find that this effect is not linear but declines at higher levels of urbanisation. Hence, for example, for an average owner-occupier household moving from Cairns to Brisbane city – an increase in urbanisation of around 2 000 persons per square kilometre – the increase in their housing share of total assets is estimated to be 5.6 percentage points."

Many different explanations of the cause of the deficit have been offered, and to varying degrees we believe that all may have played a role: low private saving in the US; large public-sector budget deficits; a ‘glut’ of savings in the rest of world; and, perhaps even a misalignment of nominal exchange rates. In this paper we explore the role of one other factor that also has been mentioned prominently: private saving in the US is low because income growth is expected to be strong. We rework the standard neoclassical two-country model to show how a country will be a net borrower when its future share of world GDP is expected to increase above its current share. Our research ultimately is motivated by the question of whether the US current account is ‘sustainable’. The way we approach the question is to see whether the high level of US spending currently is compatible with an optimal path of borrowing. In particular, what assumptions about expected future growth of the US’s share of world output could justify its current account deficit? We show that if the deficit can be explained by higher future income shares, then the size of the real depreciation, that may otherwise be required to reduce the deficit, may be quite small."

In this paper, we use a panel of data from 20 OECD countries to see if there is a role for various indicators of structural reform in explaining the general decline in output volatility. We suggest that reforms in product and labour markets can reduce volatility of aggregate output by encouraging productive resources to shift more readily in response to differential shocks across firms and sectors. In contrast to other studies, we include direct measures of product market regulations and monetary policy regimes as indicators of structural reform. We find that less product market regulation and stricter monetary policy regimes have played a role in reducing output volatility. Our estimates are reasonably robust to a number of alternative specifications, including those that attempt to control for a possible trend in common (unexplained) innovations to output volatility such as a possible decline in the magnitude of global shocks."

The resulting monthly and quarterly indices both provide plausible measures of the Australian business cycle. The indices are quite robust to the selection of variables used in their construction, the sample period used in estimation, and the number of factors included. Notably, only a small number of factors is needed to adequately capture the business cycle. The coincident indices provide a much smoother representation of the cycle in economic activity than do standard national accounts measures, especially in the period prior to the early 1980s. Accordingly, they suggest that the marked decline in volatility evident in quarterly Australian GDP growth that occurred up to the 1980s may overstate the reduction in the volatility of economic activity and may at least partially reflect improvements in the measurement of GDP. Because the coincident indices present a smoother perspective of the business cycle in the 1960s and 1970s, they identify fewer recessions in this period than does GDP. Over the past 45 years, the coincident indices locate three recessions – periods when there was a widespread downturn in economic activity; in 1974–1975, 1982–1983 and 1990–1991."

This paper estimates a small structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model for Australia to examine the intertwined relationships of credit with other key macroeconomic variables. At short horizons, shocks to the interest rate, the exchange rate, and past shocks to credit are found to be important for credit growth. Over longer horizons, shocks to output, inflation and commodity prices play a greater role. The response of credit to changes in monetary policy is found to be relatively slow, similar to that of inflation and slower than that of output. The model suggests that an unexpected 25 basis point increase in the interest rate results in the level of credit being almost half of a percentage point lower than it otherwise would have been after a bit over one year, and almost 1 per cent lower after four years. Estimates from the model indicate that in responding to the macroeconomic consequences of a credit shock, monetary policy appears to stabilise the economy effectively. As a result of monetary policy’s response, output and the exchange rate are barely affected by a credit shock. The credit shock results in higher inflation for about two years, but it would be higher still over this period in the absence of a monetary policy response. Changes in credit are also moderated as a result of monetary policy’s response."

 """,2005.,"Underlying Inflation: Concepts, Measurement and Performance","rdp2005-05, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper explores the concept of underlying inflation and the properties of various measures of underlying inflation in the Australian context. Underlying inflation measures are routinely calculated and monitored by central banks in many countries, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. Alternative measurement concepts are explored, and a range of measures that have been calculated for Australia are discussed and evaluated on the basis of statistical criteria. These criteria capture the intuition that a good measure of underlying inflation should be less volatile than CPI (or headline) inflation, be unbiased with respect to CPI inflation, and capture the ‘trend’ in CPI inflation so that, on average, CPI inflation will tend to adjust towards the measure of underlying inflation. In the Australian context, statistical measures of underlying inflation, such as the trimmed mean or weighted median, perform fairly satisfactorily against these criteria. The performance of these measures can be further improved by seasonally adjusting prices at the CPI component level. Although underlying inflation measures have become less necessary in the past decade as inflation itself has become less volatile, these findings suggest that underlying inflation measures can still add value to the analysis of inflationary trends."

We focus on the impact which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates has on the recommendations of such policy-makers. For a given target inflation rate, we identify several different forms of ‘insurance’ which policy-makers could potentially take out against encountering the ZLB due to the future bursting of a bubble. Even with perfect knowledge of the bubble process, however, which of these will be optimal varies from one type of bubble to another and, for certain bubbles, from one period to the next. It is therefore difficult to draw general conclusions as to whether the ZLB should cause policy-makers to operate policy more tightly or loosely than otherwise, while a bubble is growing – even after abstracting from the informational difficulties they face in practice. We also examine the implications of the ZLB for policy-makers’ preferences as to their inflation target. Policy-makers who wish to avoid concerns about the ZLB should take care not to set too low a target, especially if the neutral real interest rate is low. Such policy-makers should also set a higher target inflation rate if the economy’s natural propensity to rebound from a shock to output is weak, or if output is relatively unresponsive to real interest rate settings."

We examine these decisions for both owner-occupied and investment property. The results suggest that the household’s age, composition, income and wealth are important factors determining property ownership and gearing decisions. Income and wealth are found to be more influential in determining the value of property owned, while the household’s age is more influential in determining the gearing. Household composition is important for decisions on owner-occupied property, but has a limited influence on investment property decisions."

We use an event study with carefully selected sample periods for four countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom) to ensure that the change in monetary policy is exogenous to the exchange rate. Intraday data allow us to use a short event window, which improves the accuracy of estimates, and demonstrates that the change in policy is rapidly incorporated into the exchange rate. On average, an unanticipated tightening of 25 basis points is found to appreciate the exchange rate by around 0.35 per cent, with estimates for the individual countries ranging from ¼–½ of a per cent. The estimation indicates that monetary policy changes account for only a small part of the observed variability of exchange rates in these countries. We also find that changes in monetary policy have substantially different effects on the exchange rate depending on how they alter expectations regarding future policy. Surprises that cause expectations of future policy to be revised by the full amount of the surprise are found to have a larger impact on the exchange rate (around 0.4 per cent) than surprises that only bring forward an anticipated change in policy and do not change expectations of future policy (around 0.2 per cent)."

Since Australia predominantly exports commodities and imports manufactures, the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis suggests that there should be a negative trend in the terms of trade. But the trend is no more than –0.1 per cent per annum, less than the trend decline in world commodity prices relative to manufactured goods prices. The weaker trend appears to be the result of Australia exporting, and importantly diversifying toward, commodities with faster price growth. Extending the sample using projections for the terms of trade for the two years to 2005/06 based on commodity price movements to date, the apparent downward trend disappears. Indeed, based on these projections, the terms of trade will have increased by around 50 per cent over the period 1987–2006, unwinding the decline over the preceding 30 years. We also investigate the volatility of the terms of trade and demonstrate that it was significantly higher between 1923 and 1952. This is attributable to substantially higher volatility in the export prices of a few key commodity exports. Volatility declined after 1952 due to smaller shocks to the prices of these goods. The diversification in Australia’s export base since then means that the terms of trade are less susceptible to shocks to prices of individual commodity exports."

Indeed, Australia’s openness ratio (exports plus imports as a proportion of GDP) in 2002 was the third-lowest among the 30 OECD countries. This paper seeks to understand Australia’s low openness by analysing the empirical determinants of aggregate country trade. We begin by estimating a standard gravity model of bilateral trade. Although the model appears to fit the bilateral data very well, it does a relatively poor job at fitting countries’ aggregate trade levels, with different methodologies sometimes providing highly conflicting results. The focus of the paper is an equation for country openness. Our equation explains a substantial amount of the variation in how much countries trade using a small number of explanatory variables. We find that the most important determinants of openness are population and a measure of distance to potential trade partners. Countries with larger populations trade less, as do countries that are relatively more remote. Furthermore, after controlling for trade policy there is little evidence of a positive correlation between openness and economic development. While gravity models suggest Australia trades much more than expected, the openness equation suggests that its level of trade is relatively close to what would be expected. The most important factors in explaining Australia’s low openness ratio are its distance to the rest of the world, and to a lesser extent its large geographic size."

Central banks’ transparency is in most respects much greater than it was a decade ago, and so central bank communication needs to be included as a potential source of news. We therefore consider four types of news: macroeconomic news, overseas news, monetary policy surprises and central bank communication. The effect of these types of news on daily changes in interest rate futures is estimated using an EGARCH model for a panel of six economies. We find that interest rate expectations respond to both macroeconomic and policy news, although the response to macroeconomic news is larger, especially once we include foreign news. Overall, the results suggest that the impact of the RBA’s communication policy is in line with other major central banks, and significantly influences (and informs) expectations of future monetary policy."

An implication of our model is that the major source of cyclical fluctuation in state activity is shocks that are common to all states. Region-specific shocks appear to have a moderate influence on cyclical fluctuations, while spillovers of such shocks from one state to another seem to play only a minor role. These findings are consistent with the results of recent studies for the United States, Canada and Europe, where common shocks have also been found to dominate regional cyclical activity."

In this paper we invoke the ‘profit test’ first advocated by Friedman to assess whether the RBA’s foreign exchange operations have had a stabilising influence on the exchange rate. We do this over the entire post-float period, as well as for each of the three distinct cycles in the exchange rate during that period. The premise underlying the profit test is that if the central bank has made a profit from intervention in its currency, it must have ‘bought low and sold high’, which would work towards stabilising the exchange rate. Since the float, the RBA has made a profit of A$5.2 billion on its intervention operations, with profits made in each of the three cycles. The paper concludes that the profitability of intervention suggests that the RBA’s operations have had a stabilising influence on the exchange rate."

The nature of this trading suggests it is due to behavioural factors or foreigners extracting information from recent returns, rather than portfolio-rebalancing effects. Second, the price impacts associated with foreigners’ trading are much larger than earlier estimates.

They label this process ‘regression to the mean’, and argue that it explains why those OECD countries which adopted inflation targeting experienced larger falls in inflation compared to other OECD countries. This paper explores further this phenomenon of convergence of inflation rates across countries. An extension of the analysis used by Ball and Sheridan finds that convergence in inflation rates also occurs in a much larger sample of countries over the same time period that they study. However, tests using data from the 1960s to the 1980s show that inflation convergence across OECD countries does not occur consistently over time. In contrast, when this analysis is repeated with data for US metropolitan regions, convergence occurs consistently since the early 1960s. Interpreted in the context of historical developments in monetary policy, the evidence suggests that rather than just being a mechanical occurrence, the convergence in national inflation rates experienced in the 1990s was brought about by monetary policy becoming more similar across countries, with authorities becoming more focused on achieving low inflation, especially in those countries which had been less successful in reducing inflation in the 1980s. In other words, the adoption of inflation targeting at least partly contributed to inflation convergence in the 1990s."

We argue that in order to understand sudden stops and the mechanisms to smooth them, it is useful to identify and then distinguish between two inter-related dimensions of investors’ confidence: country-trust and currency-trust . Lack of country-trust is a more fundamental and serious problem behind sudden stops. But lack of currency-trust may both be a source of country-trust problems and weaken a country’s ability to deal with sudden stops. We discuss steps to improve along these two dimensions of investors’ confidence in the medium run, and policies to reduce the impact of country-trust and currency-trust weaknesses in the short run."

We first illustrate the effect of superannuation on household saving in a small theoretical model, also taking account of the effect financial deregulation and capital gains might have on saving. In an empirical model of saving motivated by our theoretical analysis, we find evidence that only part of compulsory superannuation contributions has been offset by reductions in other saving, suggesting that – other things being equal – compulsory superannuation has indeed resulted in higher household saving."

These include both ‘bottom-up’ approaches, for near-term forecasting, as well as econometric methods (such as mark-up models of inflation, which have been found to perform quite well for Australia – see de Brouwer and Ericsson (1998)). One of the econometric approaches to inflation forecasting which is sometimes considered is the use of Phillips curves based on estimates of the output gap. This paper suggests, however, that the real-time capacity of such Phillips curves to forecast inflation is limited, relative even to such simple benchmark forecasting approaches as an autoregressive (AR) model of inflation or a random walk assumption. It appears that the lack of precision with which output-gap-based Phillips curves can be estimated in real time limits their usefulness as a means of forecasting inflation in isolation. Phillips curve-based forecasts may, however, perform a little better than AR model-based ones in at least predicting whether inflation will increase or decrease from its current level. Moreover, combining Phillips curve-based forecasts with those from simple, alternative approaches does seem to offer some scope for improving the real-time forecast accuracy of the latter. These observations suggest that, in spite of their generally disappointing performance as a means of forecasting inflation in isolation, output-gap-based Phillips curves may continue to be useful in real time – as a tool for conditioning gap estimates within a multivariate filtering framework, and as a possible complement to other, alternative inflation forecasting approaches."

The first policy-maker, a sceptic, does not attempt to forecast the future possible paths for the asset-price bubble when setting policy. The second policy-maker, an activist, takes into account the complete stochastic implications of the bubble when setting policy. We examine the optimal policy recommendations of these two policy-makers across a range of plausible assumptions about the bubble. We show that the optimal monetary policy recommendations of the activist depend on the detailed stochastic properties of the bubble. There are some circumstances in which the activist clearly recommends tighter policy than that of the sceptic, while in other cases, the appropriate recommendation is to be looser than the sceptic. Other things equal, the case for ‘leaning against’ a bubble with monetary policy is stronger the lower the probability of the bubble bursting of its own accord, the larger the efficiency losses associated with big bubbles, and the higher the assumed impact of monetary policy on the bubble process."

On this level we find clearly significant results with industry-level inflation explaining industry productivity. We also find that the relationship varies by industry, with the strongest evidence of a negative relationship being found in the cases of concentrated industries, i.e., those dominated by large firms.

In this paper, we use household level data from the HILDA survey to relate households’ leverage to their observed characteristics using both graphical and econometric techniques. We also model the decisions to own a home and to have debt against it. We correct for any possible selection bias arising from these decisions before drawing conclusions about population behaviour. Much of the variation in leverage is attributable to the passage of time, as borrowers pay down their loans on schedule and the value of their homes rise. On top of these largely exogenous effects, we find evidence that some households make conscious decisions that strongly affect leverage. For example, Australian homeowners generally plan to pay off their mortgage before its contracted end date, and many are therefore ahead of schedule in paying off their housing debt. On the other hand, a minority of households have higher leverage than similar households because they have engaged in leveraged investment in both owner-occupied and rental housing."

 """,2003.,A Tale of Two Surveys: Household Debt and Financial Constraints in Australia,"rdp2003-08, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Over the past decade, household debt (as a share of household income) has reached historically high levels. This has raised concerns about whether, as a result of the rise in debt, households are now more financially ‘fragile’. Using data from the 1998/99 Household Expenditure Survey (HES), a logit model is constructed to examine the relationship between the probability of being financially constrained and the economic and demographic characteristics of households in Australia. We find that the probability of a household being constrained is significantly affected by demographic and economic variables such as age, marital status, home ownership, weekly household income, the proportion of income earned from interest, and the share of income going to repayments on mortgage debt. Unfortunately, however, we cannot separately identify households with investor housing debt and so cannot examine the relationship between this component of household debt and the probability of being financially constrained. We also apply the model to data from the 1993/94 HES and the 2001 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. Our results imply that the overall proportion of households who are financially constrained in the economy has fallen or, at worst, remained unchanged between 1994 and 2001. Separating households into financially constrained and unconstrained groups, we find that much of the rise in debt appears to have been due to unconstrained households taking on more debt. As such, the rise in the aggregate debt to income ratio associated with owner-occupier mortgages appears to be the result of voluntary household choice rather than a result of increased household financial distress. Hence, the increase in owner-occupier mortgage debt has not been associated with an increase in the proportion of households who are financially constrained."

We approach the problem using a panel of Australian states, for which we construct data on housing and stock market wealth. We estimate the link between consumption and the components of wealth using panel-data estimation techniques, including fixed-effects instrumental variable and panel DOLS estimators. Unlike previous studies, we find that both housing wealth and stock market wealth have a significant effect on Australian consumption. We estimate that a permanent increase in households’ stock market wealth of one dollar increases annual consumption by 6 to 9 cents in the long run while a permanent increase in housing wealth of one dollar is estimated to increase long-run annual consumption by around 3 cents. However, given that households’ housing assets are more than three times as large as stock market assets, our estimates imply that a one per cent increase in housing wealth has an effect on aggregate consumption that is at least as large as that of a one per cent increase in stock market wealth."

 """,2003.,The Characteristics and Trading Behaviour of Dual-listed Companies,"rdp2003-06, Reserve Bank of Australia.","We examine the characteristics and stock price behaviour of existing and recently unified dual-listed companies (DLCs, also known as Siamese-twin companies). DLC structures are effectively mergers in which companies agree to combine their operations and cash flows, but retain separate identities and shareholder registries. We identify 14 such international structures and survey the rationales that have been advanced for the creation as well as the unification of such groups. We find that three recent Anglo-Australian DLCs exhibit the ‘excess comovement’ phenomenon identified by Froot and Dabora (1999) and confirm this phenomenon has persisted for the long-standing Anglo-Dutch DLCs. We also investigate what happens to the market exposures of DLCs that have been abandoned in favour of a unified structure. Standard models would suggest there should be no change in the betas of the combined firm, while models of trading-based comovement would suggest that betas could change. We find that the market value of the unified DLCs becomes more (less) correlated with the market index of the new primary (secondary) market after unification. Together with the evidence for excess comovement, this result is consistent with a model where the market prices of assets depend not only on fundamentals, but also on the location of trade and the investors that hold the assets. Finally, we conduct an event study into the stock returns of DLC twins around the time of unification announcements. Unifications of the share structure have typically occurred on the market that placed the higher value on the cash flows of the DLC. Not surprisingly, the pricing of the twins converges after these announcements, and we find that a rise in the value of the discounted twin is apparently accompanied by a modest fall in the value of the twin trading at a premium."

We examine whether interest rate variability has changed, the degree to which financial markets anticipate policy moves and movements in the yield curve at the time of changes in monetary policy. Where possible, we compare the results for Australia with other countries. We find that interest rate volatility at the short end has fallen dramatically since the late 1980s. The extent to which market participants anticipate changes in the policy rate has gradually risen, as has the speed of reaction to interest rate announcements. Since the late 1990s, bill futures contract prices have responded to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) commentaries on the economy. These results are consistent with an increase in the efficiency with which the market digests economic news. The results are quite similar across countries, and it is difficult to isolate from cross-country data any specific preferred model of monetary policy transparency."

 """,2003.,Identifying the Efficacy of Central Bank Interventions: Evidence from Australia,"rdp2003-04, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The endogeneity of exchange rates and intervention has long plagued studies of the effectiveness of central banks’ actions in foreign exchange markets. Researchers have either excluded contemporaneous intervention so that their explanators are predetermined, or obtained a small, and typically incorrectly signed, coefficient on contemporaneous intervention. Failing to account for the endogeneity, when central banks lean against the wind and trade strategically, will likely result in a large downward bias to the coefficient on contemporaneous intervention – explaining the negative coefficient frequently obtained. We use an alternative identification assumption – a change in the intervention policy of the Reserve Bank of Australia – that allows us to estimate, using simulated Generalised Method of Moments (GMM), a model that includes the contemporaneous impact of intervention. There are three main results. Our point estimates suggest that central bank intervention has an economically significant contemporaneous effect. A US$100 million purchase of the domestic currency will appreciate the exchange rate by 1.3 to 1.8 per cent. This estimate is remarkably similar to the calibration conducted by Dominguez and Frankel (1993c), who themselves noted their estimate was larger than previous empirical findings. Secondly, the vast majority of the effect of an intervention on the exchange rate is found to occur during the day in which it is conducted, with only a smaller impact on subsequent days. Finally, we confirm findings that Australian central bank intervention policy can be characterised as leaning against the wind."

New Evidence from Emerging Markets,"rdp2003-02, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper provides new empirical evidence relevant to the debate over the desirability of reforms to the way that financial markets and the international community deal with sovereign debt crises. In particular, given the ongoing opposition of investors and some sovereigns to greater use of collective action clauses (CACs) in emerging market bonds, we present new evidence on the way that financial markets have priced the use or non-use of CACs. We supplement existing evidence that the use of CACs in Euromarket issues has not affected yields on new bond issues through an event study that shows that decisions by issuers to change away from, or to, the use of CACs has also not affected the pricing of issuers’ existing stock of debt in the secondary market. We also provide new evidence on the pricing of a large sample of bonds in the secondary market on 31 January 2003. The data show that even after the intense debate about sovereign debt restructuring through 2002, the inclusion or absence of CACs still had no economically or statistically significant impact on yields as of early 2003. Hence we conclude that investors still had not focused on which bonds have CACs, or that they believe that the inclusion of CACs is not relevant to the pricing of debt. The empirical evidence therefore suggests there is no good reason why there cannot be greater use of CACs, including in bonds sold into the US market. A strong case can be made that investors will benefit from well-targeted reforms to the way that sovereign debt crises are handled. Indeed, Mexico’s successful sale of global bonds with CACs on 26 February 2003 – the first placement of bonds with CACs by an emerging market sovereign into the US market – suggests that the long-held opposition to CACs in some quarters may be easing."

Four aspects are examined: the extent to which surveys are correlated with economic variables that they are designed to track; advantages in terms of timeliness; the degree to which surveys are forward or backward-looking; and the ability of business surveys to pick turning points. In summary, the business conditions (including sales/output), employment and selling prices components of the business surveys seem to provide the most information, and to a lesser extent the component relating to corporate profitability. Taken together, the surveys can provide useful coincident information on the economy with some advantage in terms of timeliness. The recommended approach to the use of business surveys is to extract common themes and not place too much weight on a single result."

The pool of potential employees is usually measured as the pool of unemployed workers. However, this ignores an important group of people who are not officially unemployed, but do represent potential labour supply the marginally attached workforce, which can be broadly defined as the people who are not currently in the labour force, but want to work and are available to take up employment. The aim of this paper is to examine the extent to which the labour market behaviour of marginally attached workers is similar to that of the unemployed. We use longitudinal data from the Survey of Employment and Unemployment Patterns (SEUP), which provides detailed information on the characteristics of individuals as well as their labour market experiences, to compare dynamic behaviour across labour market groups, for example, the probability of moving into employment. We find that in some respects the dynamic behaviour of the marginally attached is similar to that of the unemployed, but in others it is quite different. Accordingly, the most appropriate measure of labour supply depends on the policy question, and consequently a range of measures should be considered."

Since the output gap is unobservable, however, its estimation is prone to error, particularly in real time. Errors result both from revisions to the underlying data, as well as from end-point problems that are endemic to econometric procedures used to estimate output gaps. These problems reduce the reliability of output gaps estimated in real time, and lead to questions about their usefulness. We examine 121 vintages of Australian GDP data to assess the seriousness of these problems. Our study, which is the first to address these issues using Australian data, is of interest for the method we use to obtain real-time output-gap estimates. Over the past 28 years, our real-time output-gap estimates show no apparent bias, when compared with final output-gap estimates derived with the benefit of hindsight using the latest available data. Furthermore, the root-mean-square difference between the real-time and final output-gap series is less than 2 percentage points, and the correlation between them is over 0.8. Our general conclusion is that quite good estimates of the output gap can be generated in real time, provided a sufficiently flexible and robust approach is used to obtain them."

In this paper, we examine two aspects of this divergence. First, we analyse the wide variation in employment growth rates, finding that stronger rates of employment growth were associated with industry structure, proximity to factor and product markets, and the level of regional amenity. Second, we investigate how regional labour markets adjusted to different employment conditions. While regional migration is found to be the dominant adjustment channel, the relative strength of the migration adjustment differs across regions. Out-migration, accompanying employment declines, was stronger amongst regions with initially high unemployment rates and low regional amenity. Similarly, regions with initially low rates of unemployment and high regional amenity experienced stronger rates of in-migration in response to rising employment."

In particular, we ask the following questions. What are the theoretical links between financial integration and growth? Is there any empirical evidence that an increase in financial integration is associated with higher economic growth at a cross-country level? Do different types of capital flows have different implications for growth? Existing empirical evidence suggests that the link between financial openness and economic growth is weak at best. While there is some evidence that financial liberalisation positively affects growth, this relationship is not robust. There is also some evidence that the positive impact of foreign investment on growth is conditional upon the existence of relatively developed domestic institutions and sound macroeconomic policy. This result is also not very robust and is sensitive to the measures employed to capture institutional development and the policy environment. To complement the existing research, we examine this issue with a particular emphasis on the composition of capital flows. Consistent with conventional wisdom, we find that both foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows enhance economic growth. By contrast, the effect of bank inflows is found to be mostly negative."

Its use of computer technology is amongst the highest in the world with Australian business investment in computer and related equipment growing rapidly since the early 1990s. Computer use has not been uniform throughout the economy but concentrated in more service-oriented sectors such as telecommunications, and finance and insurance. Additionally, we find that around one-half of the gains from the use of information technology can be attributed to price falls while the other half can be attributed to higher nominal expenditure. We arrive at the conclusion that Australia has experienced significant output growth related to computer use and has benefited from the technological advances in the sector through lower prices passed on to users. Thus, we conclude that there are substantial benefits to be gained from being a net user of computers as well as the more commonly mentioned benefits from being a producer."

In this paper we ask what explains ‘sentiment’ and find that lagged economic indicators (such as changes in GDP, job vacancies and the cash rate) can explain a substantial proportion of the variation in a number of backward and forward-looking sentiment indices. This does not rule out the possibility that they may be useful for forecasting. We find, however, that when currently available economic information is appropriately ‘filtered’ from the sentiment indices, in most cases they fail even rudimentary Granger-causality tests of predictive ability. On a more positive note, we find that the Roy Morgan consumer confidence rating, NAB actual business conditions, NAB expected employment outlook over the next three months and the second question in the Roy Morgan and Westpac/MI consumer surveys all provide some, albeit small, contribution to forecasting employment growth. The second question of both consumer confidence surveys (which asks about anticipated personal financial conditions over the coming year) also appears to have some ability to predict recessions. Outside of these results there is little evidence that the surveys tell us anything we didn’t already know. Thus, there is reason to suspect that surveyed respondents’ forecasts offer little more information about the future path of the economy than a weighted average of lagged economic variables."

 """,2001.,"City Sizes, Housing Costs, and Wealth","rdp2001-08, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Australia’s household sector appears to hold a greater proportion of its wealth in dwellings than do households in other countries. Average dwelling prices in Australia also appear to be high relative to household income, but dwellings in Australia are not noticeably higher in quality than those in comparable countries. This concentration of wealth in housing also does not seem attributable to government policies that encourage dwelling investment in Australia to a greater extent than is true overseas. A possible reconciliation of this pattern may be the unusual concentration of Australia’s population in two large cities. Average housing prices tend to be higher in larger cities than smaller ones. Therefore, the expensive cities in Australia drag up the average level of dwelling prices more than in other countries, resulting in a higher share of wealth concentrated in housing. The increasing importance of dwelling wealth in Australia over recent years largely reflects the consequences of disinflation and financial deregulation. This is most likely a transitional effect, and the ratio of dwelling wealth to income should stabilise, or begin to grow more slowly, in the future."

Last-resort support serves to counter the market failures that can see fundamentally sound financial institutions fail due to a lack of liquidity, and to protect the economy from the systemic costs of such failures. The provision of lender-of-last-resort support, however, creates moral hazard costs. During the nineteenth century, Australian colonial governments and banking industry groups provided support to troubled financial institutions in a variety of ways that reflected both the resources they could draw on and their ability to constrain moral hazard behaviour. Since 1900, Australia’s experience has been unusual by international standards: the central bank has rarely acted as a lender of last resort; and, despite this, virtually no Australian bank depositor has lost money. Direct loans were provided only twice: once as a last-resort loan and once to ease the exit of a failed bank. Instead, support has come in more indirect forms. Loans were provided to three banks in support of their efforts to provide funds to illiquid building societies. Most instances of disruptions to financial institutions’ access to liquidity, however, have been successfully staunched by the central bank’s issuance of reassuring public statements."

The ability of macroeconomic variables to explain movements in bank risk is also considered. Discussion of banks’ credit risk is supplemented with analysis of the rate of return on assets earned by banks since the 1960s. While most of the variability in banks’ credit risk and profitability is due to differences between banks, macroeconomic variables are found to exert a strong influence on banks’ risk and profitability. The share of interest payments in the corporate and household sectors’ income, real credit growth and property prices are most strongly correlated with banks’ risk and profitability."

Consideration is given to the role played by explicit mechanisms for transmitting shocks between countries, such as trade in goods and financial assets and the coordination of monetary policy between countries. In addition we identify a number of country characteristics and institutions (including measures of legal origin, accounting standards, and the speed of take-up of new technology) that appear to lead countries to respond similarly to economic shocks. Both transmission mechanisms and common country characteristics have a role to play in explaining output correlations. When we use our empirical results to help to explain the strong correlation observed between Australian and US output growth, we conclude that trade between the two countries is not sufficiently important to account for much of the correlation. Nor does the similarity of monetary policies make much of a contribution. Our results instead suggest that it is the similarity of economic characteristics and institutions that explains much of the observed correlation between Australian and US output growth."

But this increased volatility should be kept in perspective: US-market and own-market developments generally had much greater influence on prices and volatility than the shocks originating in the Asian crisis economies. Importantly, the financial-market price reactions were very similar in Australia and New Zealand, despite the different monetary policy responses in the two countries.

We find that some of the determinants of inflation in Australia have exhibited unusual or structural change in recent years. Using a mark-up model of inflation, we attempt to identify whether there has been a change in the relationship between inflation and its determinants. We find some tentative evidence of change. Although this change is not statistically significant, it may be economically significant.

Interest rates tend to move in a sequence of steps in a given direction, or remain constant for some time, rather than experiencing the frequent reversals that commonly arise from optimal policy simulations. We categorise the types of uncertainty that have been explored to date in terms of the decision-making behaviour they imply. From this, we suggest a more intuitively appealing formulation of Knightian uncertainty than the one that has previously been used in the analysis of monetary policy. Within a very simple optimal control problem, we show that our preferred formalisation is consistent with interest rate paths with periods of no change. This suggests that the presence of Knightian uncertainty may explain some features of monetary policy-makers’ behaviour."

We find a reasonably robust steady-state relationship between non-durables consumption, labour income and aggregate household wealth for the period 1988:Q4–1999:Q3. Based upon this relationship, an increase in per capita wealth of one dollar is eventually associated with a rise in annual non-durables consumption of approximately four cents. We also find that changes in both non-financial and financial assets have significant effects on consumption. Above-trend growth of wealth in recent years has contributed significantly to growth in consumption over this time. A further noteworthy result concerns the recent demutualisations and share floats in Australia; perhaps surprisingly, we find no evidence that these events had a significant effect on consumption growth.

However, little is known about nominal wage flexibility since investigations have been hindered by a lack of suitable data. Using a unique and unpublished microdata set, we find strong evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity. The idea that firms are able to circumvent wage rigidity by varying broader forms of remuneration is not supported by our study. We find that these broad measures are still skewed away from pay cuts, though to a lesser extent than wages. Not all of the observed rigidity is binding, though, since skewness away from wage cuts appears to occur for reasons other than downward wage rigidity. However, the extent of rigidity we do observe lends support to the pursuit of small positive rates of inflation as an objective of monetary policy."

It shows that parameter uncertainty does not induce much smoothness when its effects are directly incorporated into a model. Uncertainty about the interest sensitivity of output can increase the smoothness of optimal policy in a model, but the path of policy interest rates generated is still considerably more variable than that observed in practice."

 """,2000.,Inflation Targeting and Exchange Rate Fluctuations in Australia,"rdp2000-06, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Several recent papers have explored the possibility that inflation-targeting central banks in small open economies pay too much attention to exchange rate fluctuations; changing short-term interest rates in response to fluctuations that have transient effects on inflation could be counterproductive. Accordingly, we investigate whether the Reserve Bank of Australia, while ultimately concerned with aggregate inflation and output, should set short-term interest rates on the basis of expected inflation in the non-tradeable sector or go even further and react directly to expected wage pressures in that sector’s labour market. Our results indicate that there are no clear gains to be had from responding only to measures of inflation which abstract from temporary exchange rate fluctuations. The variability of inflation and output would be at least as great as under the current framework, while the shocks that have typically hit the Australian economy over the past couple of decades are such that interest rates would be no less variable than under the current inflation-targeting framework. We attribute these findings to the forward-looking nature of the current inflation-targeting framework, whereby exchange rate shocks are ignored in the setting of policy if they are expected to have only a temporary impact on inflation."

In a policy context, we are interested in forecasting the levels or growth of policy relevant variables throughout the cycle. We are less interested in forecasting turning points in the cycle or in forecasting coincident indices, which are subjectively defined overall measures of economic activity. This gives us a different focus to much of the recent work done in this area. We use a simple forecasting framework (bivariate VARs) to compare the Westpac-Melbourne Institute (WM), NATSTAT and ABS leading indices’ predictive performance for real GDP, employment and unemployment in Australia. Within sample we find all three indices help predict all of the activity variables, although with varying leads. Out of sample evidence, however, is weaker. Within our framework, we only find evidence in favour of the WM index when used to forecast GDP. Otherwise, the indices do not make any substantive contribution to forecast quality. To gauge the usefulness of the simple bivariate VAR models, we compare the out of sample forecasts of GDP, using the WM index, to those from a single equation structural model due to Gruen and Shuetrim (1994). Over a forecasting sample of relatively stable growth, the WM index model performs quite well relative to the Gruen and Shuetrim model. Over a longer forecasting sample period, one which includes the downturn in the early 1990s, there is some evidence that the WM index model performs relatively poorly."

In examining the empirical evidence, we concentrate on the stock and foreign exchange markets. The efficient market hypothesis is almost certainly the right place to start when thinking about asset price formation. The evidence suggests, however, that it cannot explain some important and worrying features of asset market behaviour. Most importantly for the wider goal of efficient resource allocation, financial market prices appear at times to be subject to substantial misalignments, which can persist for extended periods of time."

This paper investigates why this might be the case, whether this is a recent phenomenon, and whether declining demand for unskilled labour, perhaps coupled with wage inflexibility, is an important explanation for the observed increase in the Australian unemployment rate over the past three decades. We find that relative demand shifts towards skilled labour are not an important determinant of the increase in overall unemployment. The shift in demand towards skilled labour has been matched by an equivalent shift in labour supply, leaving the structure of relative unemployment rates across skill groups fairly stable. Unemployment of both skilled and unskilled labour has increased, but this appears to be for reasons unrelated to relative demand shifts across skill groups. We also discuss possible reasons for the pervasively higher unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, drawing on data on individuals from the Survey of Employment and Unemployment Patterns (SEUP). We find that the high unskilled unemployment rate is associated with a higher exit probability from employment relative to skilled workers (a high ‘separation rate’), and a lower probability of finding employment from non-employment (a low ‘matching rate’)."

The model we use is a modification of the small open economy model developed for the G6 economies (the G7 less the United States) by Kim and Roubini (1999). The success of the Kim and Roubini model across these economies makes it a natural starting point to analyse monetary policy in Australia. Consistent with Kim and Roubini, we find no evidence of the price or exchange rate puzzles identified in the literature. We demonstrate that, in the Australian context, modelling the interdependence between the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate and the nominal exchange rate is critical to resolving these puzzles. Further, we demonstrate that the Kim and Roubini model can be further usefully refined when applied to the Australian data. We use the model to perform various monetary policy experiments and the results of these experiments accord well with both the existing SVAR literature and previous empirical work for Australia. We find that monetary policy shocks have a delayed and gradual effect on the price level and a small temporary effect on output. We also use the model to examine the effects of shocks to the Australian economy and the role of monetary policy in response to these shocks. Generally, we find that monetary policy has served to dampen both output and price fluctuations. A qualifying aspect of our results is the model’s instability, for example, around the most recent change in the implementation of monetary policy in Australia."

Optimal policy responses are derived for a monetary authority that targets inflation and output stability. Parameter uncertainty is characterised by the estimated distribution of the model coefficient estimates. Learning is ruled out, so the monetary authority can commit to its ex ante policy response. We find that taking account of parameter uncertainty can recommend more, rather than less, activist use of the policy instrument. While we acknowledge that this finding is specific to the model specification, parameter estimates and the shocks analysed, the result does stand in contrast to the widely held belief that the generic implication of parameter uncertainty is more conservative policy."

These determinants depend, in turn, on the volatility of the return on bank assets and the bank’s level of capital. Although accounting measures of the volatility of the rate of return on bank assets and bank capital-asset ratios are published on a regular basis, market prices provide alternative risk measures. This paper uses share prices to estimate these risks measures for 15 Australian banks that were listed on the Australian Stock Exchange for all, or part of, the period 1983 to 1998. Option prices are also used to generate alternative estimates of these risk measures, the results of which corroborate those obtained from share prices. We find that the market’s assessment of the capital-asset ratio for the Australian banking sector has risen considerably over the sample period. There has also been a slight upward trend in the volatility of asset returns. These two trends have opposite effects on the market’s assessment of total bank risk: rising capital-asset ratios reduce bank risk, but rising asset volatility increases it. To uncover which trend has dominated, we examine a couple of measures of total bank risk, which summarises the net impact of movements in both the capital-asset ratio and asset volatility. These additional risk measures suggest that the riskiness of the sector has declined. In investigating the relationship between banks’ capital-asset ratio and asset volatility over time, we find that increases in the growth of the capital-asset ratio precede increases in asset volatility which, in turn, cause a slowdown in capital growth."

The extent to which it does so in part reflects some design features of the inflation-targeting framework, such as targeting bands and the policy horizon, that have been adopted in practice in the inflation-targeting countries. Medium-term price stability can be maintained while still allowing some degree of short-run inflation variability, thus providing scope for lower output variability."

This paper examines what factors affect the way teenagers look for work in order to explain why we observe this behaviour. We find that the single most important characteristic for explaining the job-search method choices of Australian teenagers is whether they receive unemployment benefits. Receiving benefits increases the probability of teenagers using the government employment agency as the main job-search method by almost 20 percentage points, and decreases their probability of using direct methods (such as contacting employers or friends and relatives) or newspapers by around 10 percentage points each. Personal characteristics and family background are also important for understanding the job-search methods chosen by unemployed teenagers. Another interesting finding is that the local environment, especially the state of the local labour market, is important for explaining job-search method choice. Higher local unemployment rates decrease the probability that an unemployed teenager will use direct search methods, and increase the probability that they will use the government employment agency. These results may help to explain the recently documented evidence that unemployment has become increasingly concentrated in low-socioeconomic-status neighbourhoods (Gregory and Hunter 1995)."

This captures both the probability of various financial disturbances and the size of the macroeconomic costs arising from such disturbances. Because of the links between the real sector of the economy and the financial sector, monetary policy needs to be cognisant of the potential for financial system stability. We develop a general framework for policy analysis which highlights the trade-off between financial system stability and efficiency. We use this framework to analyse the potential impact on stability and efficiency of three current pressures in the Australian financial system. Namely, consolidation among the largest banks, the formation of large financial conglomerates, and greater opportunities for smaller niche institutions provided by technological developments. We develop a simple model to show that consolidation might reduce system stability through a loss of diversification – which is important in the case of idiosyncratic shocks to individual financial institutions. Offsetting this effect, consolidation might increase system stability if contagion is an important source of failure of financial institutions. Conglomeration has two offsetting effects in terms of system stability: diversification across different financial services can reduce the probability of failure of an individual institution; and contamination, which can lead to contagion flowing from failure of an unhealthy arm of the conglomerate."

VaR is a measure of the potential loss that may occur from adverse moves in market prices (interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices and so forth). The capacity for a VaR measure to accurately predict future risk exposures depends upon the forecasts of the volatility of market rates and the correlations between the various market rates (that is, the variance-covariance matrix) incorporated into the VaR model. In this paper we first present the results of tests of the stability of the variances, covariances and correlations for exchange rates and Australian interest rates. Secondly, we assess the performance of several time-series models that may be used to forecast the variance-covariance matrix. In particular three models for the variance-covariance matrix are considered: equally weighted historical variances and covariances, exponentially weighted averages of historical variances and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH). We conclude that simple models perform as well as their more sophisticated GARCH counterparts."

People with better access to information or more developed information-processing skills – such as professionals, those with more education, or older people – tend to have lower and more accurate inflation expectations. While inflation expectations are not correlated with the structural determinants of inflation (like the output gap, exchange rate movements or wages growth), tighter monetary policy does appear to reduce expected inflation. People also associate ‘good times’ with strong growth, low unemployment and low inflation. It is shown that householders’ inflation expectations do not appear to fully incorporate information about past inflation and exchange rate movements."

The results suggest that around one-fifth of adult unemployed job seekers would be willing to work for a wage less than the legal minimum. It is also found that a job seekers’ reservation wage has little effect on his/her unemployment duration. Instead, the binding constraint for job seekers appears to be that they receive very few job offers. Although legal minimum wages could be part of the story, more research is required to properly understand their role in the dynamics of the labour market."

These Phillips curves allow the NAIRU to change through time, and include a role for import prices and ‘speed-limit’ effects.

In essence, these models fail because they imply that both inflation and real variables must ‘jump’ in response to monetary policy (and other) shocks, in contrast to identified VAR evidence that shows a gradual, ‘hump shaped’ response. This paper discusses a rigorous empirical standard for monetary policy models. The motivation for this discussion is that, if one wishes to conduct welfare analysis, one must be reasonably confident that the model provides a good approximation to underlying consumer and firm behaviour over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the short run. The paper examines a specific alternative to the standard consumption model in which consumers’ utility depends in part on current consumption relative to past consumption. This formulation of habit formation allows one to nest habit formation, life-cycle consumption, and Campbell and Mankiw’s ‘rule of thumb’ consumers within a more general model. The empirical tests developed in the paper show that one can reject the hypothesis of no habit formation with tremendous confidence. This result suggests that models that are unable to produce a hump-shaped response will be strongly rejected empirically."

Existing evidence demonstrates that the short-term variance of bilateral RERs is on average about 12 times higher under floating nominal exchange rate regimes than under fixed regimes. By comparison, based on pooled results across a set of countries with low and stable inflation and stable growth rates from 1978 to 1994, the effective RER is only twice as volatile under floating regimes compared with fixed regimes. Although this difference is statistically significant, results within countries show that for most countries there was no significant increase in effective RER volatility when moving to more flexible exchange-rate regimes. Surprisingly, there are even some countries for which volatility is lower under more flexible exchange-rate regimes. In part our findings reflect the fact that effective RERs are an average of bilateral RERs. Also, we suggest that there is a difference between a fixed exchange-rate regime during Bretton Woods and a fixed exchange-rate regime post-Bretton Woods."

Several methods are used to construct measures of core inflation which abstract from these unrepresentative shocks; this paper focuses on trimmed means. Analysis of Australian CPI component price changes shows they are widely dispersed. Further, they are not normally distributed; there is a large proportion of extreme price changes (the distribution is fat-tailed) and the distribution is usually positively skewed. With an understanding of the behaviour of price changes, trimmed means are then developed. It is found that trimmed means provide a better measure of trend, or core, inflation when a large proportion of the distribution is removed. As a consequence of the distribution’s systematic positive skew, slightly more than half of the trim should be taken from the left-hand tail to ensure that the trimmed mean records average inflation equal to that of the whole CPI."

Estimates of the gap vary with the method used and are sensitive to changes in model specification and sample period.

We find that announcements about US economic news have had a large impact on yields in Australia – especially bond yields. Of the domestic announcements, the market responds to: monetary policy announcements, the CPI, the labour force and AWOTE, as well as a range of other economic statistics. We also find that the fixed-interest market seems to distinguish between the information contained in different economic announcements and that traders systematically respond to the size and direction of any unanticipated component of these announcements. The results suggest that the market perceives that information on prices, employment and wages is more important in the Reserve Bank’s decisions about monetary policy than are other indicators of economic activity. Taken in sum, the results also suggest some consistency of response to news in the fixed-interest market in Australia."

An important innovation of our approach is that we isolate the effects of exchange rate, supply and demand shocks by analysing the conditional variance of macroeconomic variables. We show that monetary policy should be more activist in response to exchange rate shocks for a flexible aggregate inflation target than for a flexible non-traded inflation target. However, in response to demand and supply shocks monetary policy is more activist for a flexible non-traded inflation target. The result is robust to the inclusion of forward-looking expectations, gradual exchange rate pass-through, and discretionary policy. In order to avoid excessive volatility in product and financial markets, it may be preferable to target inflation over a medium-term horizon."

In a closed economy, the optimal policy is a ‘Taylor rule’ in which the interest rate depends on output and inflation. In an open economy, the optimal rule changes in two ways. First, the policy instrument is a ‘Monetary Conditions Index’ – a weighted average of the interest rate and the exchange rate. Second, on the right side of the rule, inflation is replaced by ‘long-run inflation’, a variable that filters out the transitory effects of exchange-rate movements. The model also implies that pure inflation targeting is dangerous in an open economy, because it creates large fluctuations in exchange rates and output. Targeting long-run inflation avoids this problem and produces a close approximation to the optimal instrument rule."

The most noteworthy development has been the rise in the aggregate unemployment rate over that period. The main factor accounting for this rise has been the increase in the unemployment rate for full-time male workers, which in turn has reflected slower employment growth in the industries that employ predominantly male full-time workers. While employment growth for females has been stronger than that for full-time males, it has not been sufficient to offset the rapid rise in the participation rate, resulting in a rise in the female unemployment rate. The paper also compares labour market developments in the 1990s recovery with the 1980s recovery. In line with the trend over the past 20 years, the most noteworthy development is the significantly slower growth in male full-time employment. On the other hand, growth in male part-time employment has been stronger in the 1990s. The similar trend in female unemployment rates in both recoveries reflects different forces: in the 1980s, the female participation rate was rising rapidly but employment growth was also strong, whereas in the 1990s, the participation rate has been relatively flat but employment growth has also been more subdued. Finally, the sectors that were engines of employment growth in the 1980s, particularly the finance and insurance, and retail and wholesale trade sectors, have experienced substantially slower employment growth in the 1990s."

The first half of this paper provides three pieces of information about inflation expectations – that survey measures of expectations are inconsistent with rational expectations, but less so for financial markets than households; that actual and expected inflation interact with each other; and that the foreign exchange market anticipates tighter monetary policy when inflation is higher than expected. The second half of the paper explores some policy implications. First, the variability of inflation and output is lower when policy-makers respond to model-based forecasts, rather than just current values, of inflation and output. Second, model-consistent behaviour elsewhere in the economy stabilises inflation and output, given that the model includes a central bank reaction function which the public believes the bank will adhere to. When inflation expectations differ between groups, the ex ante real interest rates that affect output and the exchange rate differ from each other, and this can induce oscillations or overshooting in the exchange rate, with consequences for the variability of inflation and output. Third, ‘optimal’ policy cannot fully compensate for the greater variability in inflation and output associated with extrapolative expectations."

This contrasts with previously held views that changes in estimates of systematic risk were an artefact of the estimators used. The central finding is that firms take actions which result in their equity betas adjusting toward unity, where equity betas are a common measure of systematic risk. This convergence phenomenon appears to result in older and larger firms having equity betas that are closer to unity than smaller and younger firms. The relationship between equity beta convergence and firm size is reconciled with the well documented negative correlation between equity betas and firm size. Also, greater deviations of systematic risk from the market average are found to be associated with a higher probability of being delisted. Having refuted the hypothesis that observed changes in systematic risk are an artefact of the estimation process, some implications for asset-market efficiency are explored."

A large and rapid fall in the nominal price of assets that form the basis of collateral for loans from financial intermediaries can have adverse effects on financial system stability. This asymmetric effect of asset price changes, by reducing the extent of intermediated finance, can reduce output below potential and keep inflation below the central bank’s target for extended periods. We demonstrate that there may be circumstances where monetary policy should be tightened in response to an emerging asset-price bubble, in order to burst the bubble before it becomes too large, even though this means that expected inflation is below target in the short run. Such a policy is optimal because it can help to avoid extreme longer-term effects of a larger asset-price bubble and its eventual collapse. In principle, the adverse effects of asset-price bubbles on financial system stability can be moderated through appropriate financial system regulation and supervision.

 """,1997.,Measuring Traded Market Risk: Value-at-risk and Backtesting Techniques,"rdp9708, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The proposed market-risk capital-adequacy framework, to be implemented at the end of 1997, requires Australian banks to hold capital against market risk. A fundamental component of this framework is the opportunity for banks to use their value-at-risk (VaR) models as the basis of the market-risk capital charge. Value-at-risk measures the potential loss on a portfolio for a specified level of confidence if adverse movements in market prices were to occur. This paper examines the VaR measure and some of the techniques available for assessing the performance of a VaR model. The first section of the paper uses a simple portfolio of two spot foreign exchange positions to illustrate three of the approaches used in the calculation of a VaR measure: variance-covariance, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation. It is concluded that, although VaR is a very useful tool, it is not without its shortcomings and so should be supplemented with other risk-management techniques. The second section of the paper focuses on the use of backtesting – the comparison of model-generated VaR numbers with actual profits and losses z– for assessing the accuracy of a VaR model. Several statistical tests are demonstrated by testing daily VaR and profit and loss data obtained from an Australian bank. The paper concludes that, although the tests are not sufficiently precise to form the basis of regulatory treatment of banks’ VaR results, the tests do provide useful diagnostic information for evaluating model performance."

We examine a number of ways in which the pricing behaviour of the Australian manufacturing industry has changed over the past couple of decades, and relate this to the substantial opening up of the economy which has occurred. Using disaggregated industry-level data, we find evidence that, when measured in the same currency, prices of Australian-produced goods have fallen relative to foreign-produced goods in many of Australia’s manufacturing industries. We attribute this, in part, to increased international competition driving inefficient domestic producers from the market. We also find, not surprisingly, that domestic price setters tend to be more sensitive to changes in foreign prices in the traded sector than in the non-traded sector, and that the more open the industry the higher the sensitivity to foreign prices."

Convexity provides a strong rationale for stabilisation policy, and it reinforces the need for policy-makers to proceed cautiously.

First, we investigate whether perfect knowledge of the future values of financial aggregates helps improve significantly the forecasting accuracy of output and inflation in a simple vector autoregression framework. The results display only one notable improvement to the forecasts with the addition of perfect information on the financial aggregates – future information on credit growth helps improve the prediction accuracy of real output growth. The improvement is most noticeable during the early 1990s recession. Second, we test whether the financial aggregates are important explanators within single-equation models that are more rigorously fitted to the data. We find only one instance in which an aggregate helps explain the variation in either real output growth or inflation – that is, the growth in credit helps explain the growth in real output in a particular specification of the output model. This finding, though, is sensitive to the choice of foreign output proxy. In sum, we conclude that while credit may have some useful information in times of financial restructuring it is unlikely that there is information in financial aggregates that is exploitable systematically for predicting either real output growth or inflation."

This has increased public understanding of monetary policy and, by increasing the attention given to changes in interest rates, has affected the way in which changes in policy are transmitted to the economy. In addition, the discipline of having to announce and explain changes in the target cash rate to the public has led to a clearer focus on the objectives of monetary policy within the RBA and improved the accountability of the Bank. It has also led to a substantial decline in the volatility of short-term interest rates and more rapid pass-through of changes in the target cash rate into deposit and lending rates. In Australia, as in many other countries, interest rates have tended to be adjusted in a series of steps in the same direction. In part, this can be explained in terms of the uncertainty that policy-makers face, and the costs involved in frequently reversing the direction of interest-rate changes."

This paper uses a simple model of Australian output to estimate the length of the lags, and then examines how attempts to grapple with the estimation problems might change the results. We estimate that output growth falls by about one-third of one per cent in both the first and second years after a one percentage point rise in the short-term real interest rate, and by about one-sixth of one per cent in the third year. This implies an average lag of about five or six quarters in monetary policy’s impact on output growth. Each of these estimates is, however, subject to considerable uncertainty. We discuss the implications for policy of these relatively long and uncertain lags. Finally, we find no evidence that the average lag from monetary policy to output growth has become any shorter in the 1990s."

However, this paper argues that a more important aspect of credibility – at least for long-term inflation expectations – may be public views about how future changes in personnel, electoral results, or economic shocks may affect central bank behaviour. In other words, there is always a positive probability that the current regime will end. Views about the nature of possible future regimes are likely to be influenced by observed past regimes."

This paper explores foreign linkages by looking at the production side of the national accounts for Australia and the United States, which is often characterised as the country at the technological frontier. Industrial structures in the two countries are broadly similar, and about two-thirds of Australian output is found to be linked to that of the United States. The US links in the agricultural and mining sectors seem to be related to aggregate demand in the United States, in both the short and long run. But in manufacturing – and notably in goods for which production is technology intensive and changing over time – there are persistent, long-run links with the corresponding sector in the United States. Combined with other evidence, the conjecture is that the US links in manufacturing are driven by the supply-side: technological change, innovation and new products are transmitted from the United States and elsewhere to Australia, mostly within two to three years. Domestic demand seems to dominate service sectors, although US aggregate demand can be relevant, as, for example, in the finance and property sector. While links with the United States are pervasive, domestic events and policies are shown to be important to economic outcomes, particularly in the short to medium term."

In contrast to conventional modelling, the approach makes explicit allowance for the possibility of structural change: inflation is modelled within a framework that allows endogenous switching between simple inflation equations. The approach may be relevant to understanding shifts in inflation expectations if the public also uses relatively simple forecasting rules in formulating expectations. The results suggest that inflation is reasonably well represented by relatively simple functions of past inflation and an output gap term, with major regime changes occurring in the early 1970s and early 1990s."

In line with similar studies overseas, we find that the Australian share market may deviate from efficient pricing over short time horizons but that there is little evidence of inefficiency over longer time horizons. To investigate the influence of share prices on investment decisions we use a simple model of real share prices to identify estimates of the ‘fundamental’ and ‘speculative’ components of share prices. As expected, the estimated fundamental component of real share prices is found to have a stronger relationship with investment than the aggregate real share price series. Despite some evidence of share price inefficiences, the speculative component of real share prices is insignificant in the same investment equations, providing evidence that speculative movements in share prices do not have a significant effect on business investment. There is evidence, however, that these speculative share price movements influence the composition of corporate financing. In particular, the timing of equity raisings appears to be influenced by both components of share prices."

Second, have Australia’s financial markets become more responsive to developments in counterpart foreign markets, and if so, what are the predominant foreign influences? Third, have international influences been more or less important than domestic cross-market influences? Fourth, is there evidence of directionality and other asymmetries in Australian financial market volatility? The paper finds no compelling evidence to suggest the presence of a trend increase in volatility over the period. Evidence does exist, however, of quite significant cross-country ‘contagion’ or ‘spillover’ effects on Australia’s bond and equity markets. For both of these markets, the predominant foreign market influence appears to be the US.

It is widely recognized that expectations play a critical role in these mechanisms, affecting both the timing and speed with which interest and exchange rates transmit shocks through to real activity and prices. Over the longer run, the influence of these two asset prices extends to the efficient allocation of capital and resources. This paper builds on previous work undertaken at the Reserve Bank and the OECD to develop single-equation, behavioural models of these two variables.

Both the US and Australian share markets appear to have a significant impact on Australian activity. Evidence is also found that the responses of investment to the share market in the two countries are remarkably similar. Given that the share markets are highly correlated, the similarity in response lags may help to explain the correlation in business cycles."

We then test the forecast performance of the VAR systems for two years out-of-sample in order to mimic more closely the real-time forecasting problem faced by policymakers. Overall, both in-sample and out-of-sample results suggest no robust finding of exploitable information for forecasting purposes in any of the financial aggregates under examination.

 """,1996.,The Evolving Structure of the Australian Financial System,"rdp9605, Reserve Bank of Australia.","During the past two or three decades structural change in the Australian financial system has been rapid. The system has grown substantially in assets and volumes of activity, has become much more open and competitive, and has undergone some significant shifts in market shares. There has also been much innovation in financial products and delivery systems. In analysing these historical trends a useful distinction can be made between two major parts of the financial system: the financial intermediaries (or credit institutions), of which banks form the largest part; and the funds managers, typified by superannuation funds and unit trusts. Although the overlaps between these two institutional groupings are increasing, their historical trends have been driven by rather different forces. Within the intermediaries sector two broad processes of change have been evident. The first involved the interaction between regulatory policy and financial innovation. Prior to the main thrust of financial deregulation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, banks lost market share to less heavily regulated institutions, a trend that eventually gave impetus to the move to deregulate. In the post-deregulation period, these trends in market share were reversed and, in the process, the system was opened to greater competition. The second main historical process has been a shift in the economics of production of banks’ traditional financial services – what is often referred to as a process of ‘unbundling’. This entails a move toward production and pricing of key products on a stand-alone basis, stimulated by the development of specialist suppliers such as mortgage managers or cash management trusts. Competition from these sources has put pressure on the traditional full-service suppliers (the banks) to cut margins and to reduce cross-subsidies. In the funds-management sector, and particularly the superannuation funds, the driving forces have been somewhat different. Policy changes in the areas of taxation and compulsory contributions have had an important impact on the structure of the industry. However, the most important factor behind the rapid growth of the industry since the early 1980s has been the high average rate of return accumulated on fund investments over that period. The available data do not yet show the increases in net new contributions to the funds expected to result from increases in compulsory contributions. Notwithstanding the historical differences between the two sectors, there have been increasing areas of overlap between them. For example, banks have become more active in funds-management business through subsidiaries, and funds-management institutions have become more active in areas of traditional bank business such as mortgage lending. These developments pose a challenge for regulators as to where are the appropriate regulatory boundaries between the different groups of institutions."

Perhaps the most important of these is the impact of the system on retirement decisions.

This paper examines the effect of financial openness on the consumption of non-durables in Australia and selected East Asian economies. A range of variables, some of which explicitly represent financial regulation, are used to proxy the shadow price of the liquidity constraint. Non-durable consumption in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand can be modelled as the outcome of constrained optimisation, in some cases with time-varying real interest rates and demographic change, while that in Australia is liquidity unconstrained, at least from the 1980s. The constraint appears constant but very weak in Hong Kong and declining in Singapore, consistent with the extent and timing of domestic and international financial reforms in these economies. It appears unchanged for Japan and Korea. For Taiwan and Thailand, there is strong evidence that domestic financial regulation and control have constrained the intertemporal optimisation of consumption, although the constraint may be expected to unwind with recent liberalisation. The experience of Australia and the selected East Asian economies suggests that the liberalisation of the capital account, combined with deregulation and expansion of the domestic financial sector, eases the constraints on consumption smoothing. Financial integration does matter. The experience of these countries also indicates that there is no simple connection between the openess of a country’s financial system and its saving and investment performance."

Australia’s terms of trade exhibit temporary fluctuations around a slowly declining trend, and movements in Australia’s real exchange rate tend to follow those in the terms of trade. Together these results imply predictability in Australia’s real exchange rate as well as the presence of predictable excess returns that are sometimes quite large. Using a simple econometric model, with the terms of trade as the sole explanator, the paper demonstrates the forecastability of Australia’s real exchange rate over horizons ranging from one to two years. It then quantifies the magnitude of the predictable excess returns to holding Australian dollar denominated assets over such horizons, finding them to be highly variable and sometimes quite large in magnitude. The results suggest a relative scarcity of forward-looking foreign exchange market participants with an investment horizon of a year or more."

 """,1995.,Superannuation and Saving,"rdp9511, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The system of providing for retirement income in Australia has undergone marked changes over the past two decades, particularly in the 1980s when changes in pension entitlements and superannuation legislation encouraged a sharp rise in superannuation saving. However, there has been no obvious pickup in aggregate household saving, raising the possibility that households may have offset the increase by reducing other forms of saving. Our results suggest that, in the past, there has been a significant degree of substitution between superannuation and other forms of saving, although the offsets have not been complete. Our estimates are not very precise, but they suggest that, over the past 35 years, about three-quarters of superannuation saving has been offset by changes in other saving. The results are consistent with the results of recent overseas studies which find large offsets between saving through retirement income plans and other forms of saving. It is too early to tell whether the new superannuation arrangements will generate significant increases in aggregate household saving, although a number of features of the new arrangements suggest that offsets between superannuation and other forms of saving are likely to be smaller than in the past. In particular the new arrangements rely heavily on compulsory rather than voluntary saving, as well as expanding the coverage of superannuation among those wage and salary earners who are most likely to be liquidity constrained. For these reasons the new arrangements are likely to generate increased superannuation saving with smaller offsets against other saving than earlier schemes."

The results suggest the Australian economy can be characterised as one where firms are trying to achieve their desired long-run income share while workers are primarily concerned with maintaining their real wage. The estimation of the price-wage model is complicated by two problems; namely the substantial and persistent changes in income shares and the changing means in the inflation series over the sample. The first problem was overcome by extending the estimation period to include the wage shocks in the early 1970s which allows the income shares to be characterised as stationary. The second problem was addressed by imposing a restriction to the wage equation. This allowed a range of possible steady state inflation rates in the model over the estimated sample.

 """,1995.,Macroeconomic Policies and Growth,"rdp9507, Reserve Bank of Australia.","While economic theory is largely mute on the question of whether macroeconomic policies affect long-run growth, an examination of the experience of different countries over various periods and the policies they pursued, lends strong support to the idea that macro policies do play a role in the growth process. A macroeconomic policy framework conducive to growth can be characterised by five features: a low and predictable inflation rate; an appropriate real interest rate; a stable and sustainable fiscal policy; a competitive and predictable real exchange rate; and a balance of payments that is regarded as viable. Countries with these macroeconomic characteristics tend to grow faster than those without them, though there are many individual cases of both developing and developed countries suggesting that satisfying only some of these conditions does not sustain strong growth. It is also important to recognise that the direction of causation is somewhat ambiguous: while good macro outcomes should be conducive to growth, strong growth is also conducive to good macroeconomic outcomes. The paper presents a wide-ranging examination of both theoretical and empirical evidence on the many ways macroeconomic policies may influence economic growth. Given monetary policy’s crucial role in determining the inflation rate in the longer run, there is a particular emphasis on the relationship between inflation and growth. The following five broad conclusions are drawn. First, although growth models assign a major role to capital accumulation, there is little evidence that aggregate investment yields excess returns, and so special policy incentives to boost aggregate investment appear inappropriate. Second, countries with low national saving invest less and grow more slowly than they would if saving were higher. Ultimately, the extent to which a country can rely on foreign savings to fund domestic investment and growth depends on the rate of capital inflow the market accepts as sustainable. For Australia, with abundant natural resources and a stable political environment, this may be higher than for many other capital importing countries. Third, declining national saving rates in many industrial countries are primarily a consequence of lower government saving, suggesting a need for reduced fiscal deficits. In Australia, however, private savings have also fallen substantially, suggesting a possible role for specific incentives to boost private savings. Fourth, when economies are near potential, short-run rises in output seem to be more inflationary than falls in output are disinflationary. This implies that macroeconomic policy acting pre-emptively to counter expected future demand pressures and quickly mitigating the effects of unexpected shocks has a positive effect on the level of output, compared with a more hesitant approach acting only when demand pressures have appeared. Further, provided inflation is kept close to its target in the medium term, policy which tolerates some short-term deviations of inflation from its target reduces fluctuations in real output and generates a higher long-run output level than a policy with the sole goal of keeping inflation close to its target. Finally, although most economists believe even moderate rates of inflation adversely affect growth, unambiguous evidence has been difficult to come by. There is still professional disagreement on the robustness of the empirical evidence, but it does appear that higher inflation, and the associated increased uncertainty about future inflation, adversely affects growth in the industrial countries. The gains from lower inflation appear to exceed the initial costs of reducing inflation within about a decade."

Rules for setting interest rates on deposits and loans are derived, and these are shown to be consistent with commercial banking practice and to capture recent key developments in the banking sectors of the region. An error-correction model is used to show that the integration of domestic institutional financial markets has increased substantially over the past decade, due to pervasive liberalisation and, more recently, growing competitiveness. The adjustment of domestic institutional rates to changes in money market rates has increased, often significantly, and by the first half of the 1990s the speed and pattern of adjustment of institutional rates in most of the developing/newly developed economies of East Asia had become similar to that in economies with developed financial systems. There is also a difference between the adjustment of deposit and loan rates, with the former adjusting more rapidly. This may be explained by differences in the maturity, substitutability and transactions costs associated with loans and deposits. The riskiness of private borrowers and the poor health of the banking system were shown to have a significant, deleterious effect on the level of loan rates in the region. Country differences are analysed and implications for monetary policy, competition policy and supervision policy are noted."

In addition, in the retail and wholesale trade industry, measured productivity growth was retarded by the deregulation of store trading hours.

It presents estimates of the average degree of pass-through of cash rate changes to these other interest rates. It also presents a model of the spread between banks’ lending rates and the cash rate, and then uses the model to analyse developments in bank lending spreads over recent years. The paper argues that while banks’ average lending spreads did not widen in the early 1990s, the margin between lending rates and the cash rate did increase. It examines the reasons for this change, paying particular attention to the roles played by changes in the structure of banks’ liabilities, changes in default probabilities and changes in the degree of competition. The large lending spreads at the margin have led to intensification of competition, particularly in the market for housing loans. While these competitive pressures took some time to emerge, they are now playing a role in the narrowing of margins."

It also provides a more detailed rationale for this objective. In doing so, the paper discusses the issues relevant in determining the appropriate mean inflation rate at which policy should aim, the degree of variation of inflation around that central point, and how policy should respond to shocks. A simple model of the economy is presented which attempts to address these issues in a consistent framework."

This paper examines these implications and establishes the importance of expected inflation for this story. We derive the model relationship between expected inflation, the economy-wide distribution of industry price changes and actual inflation, and show that both Australian and US industry-price data strongly support this derived relationship. The inflationary impact of relative price shocks depends strongly on expected inflation. When expected inflation is high, a rise in the economy-wide dispersion of shocks is inflationary in the short-run. By contrast, when expected inflation is low, a rise in the dispersion of shocks has minimal impact on inflation. Economy-wide relative price shocks, like terms of trade shocks, are an unavoidable feature of the economic landscape. Their disruptive effect on inflation is minimal, however, when average inflation, and therefore average expected inflation, is kept low."

 """,1994.,"Demand Shocks, Inflation and the Business Cycle","rdp9411, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper examines how firms adjust output and prices in response to changes in demand and costs, paying particular attention to the role that capacity utilisation plays in affecting these relationships. It primarily uses qualitative survey data on manufacturing firms’ actual and expected outcomes for these variables, and traces through the short-term effects of changes in demand on costs, output and prices. The survey data also enables an analysis of how firms respond to unexpected shocks to costs and demand. The paper finds that strong demand growth leads to increases in both output and prices, and there is some evidence that capacity constraints do affect this relationship. When capacity utilisation is high, changes in demand have a smaller effect on output and a larger effect on prices, than when capacity utilisation is low. The paper distinguishes between the direct effect that changes in demand have on prices, through changes in margins, and the indirect effect, through demand-induced changes in firms’ costs. It finds that inflationary pressures are predominantly driven by increases in input costs. While margins appear to move pro-cyclically, there is a degree of asymmetry in their behaviour. Movements in margins appear to be largest in recessionary periods with margins falling as the economy goes into recession and then being rebuilt relatively early in the recovery. In boom times pressures on prices come largely through increases in costs, with little additional contribution from changes in margins."

Initial testing indicates that both interest rates and inflation contain unit roots. Furthermore, there are indications that the variables have non-standard error processes. To overcome problems associated with this and derive the correct small sample distributions of test statistics we make use of Monte Carlo simulations. These tests indicate that while a long-run Fisher effect seems to exist there is no evidence of a short-run Fisher effect. This suggests that, while short-run changes in interest rates reflect changes in monetary policy, longer-run levels indicate inflationary expectations. Thus, the longer-run level of interest rates should not be used to characterise the stance of monetary policy."

This study assesses the efficacy of the proposed methods for measuring risk and allocating capital to exposures from traded debt securities, traded equities and foreign exchange. The analysis draws on actual portfolio data from banks, as well as random hypothetical portfolios, measured against historical movements in debt and equity prices and exchange rates. The conclusions drawn are broadly that the capital charges generated under the proposed methods are conservative, when measured against historical changes in portfolio values. In the case of the debt securities and foreign exchange proposals, the capital charges are reasonably well correlated with risk in portfolios; higher risk portfolios attract higher capital charges.

Two distinct stages can be identified in the adjustment process. First, changes in the exchange rate are passed on to changes in the prices of imports over the docks. Second, these prices are, in turn, passed on to final retail import prices. It is found that pass-through in the first stage is rapid and complete. In the second stage, pass-through is also complete. It is, however, rather slow as importers appear able to vary their mark-ups substantially and for considerable periods of time. Moreover, the sizeable domestic costs involved in the distribution and sale of imports imply that a proportional change in the price of imports over the docks does not lead to the same proportional change in the retail import price, but rather one that is equal to the share of the imported item in the total bundle of costs faced by importers."

Whether this intervention has been stabilising cannot be directly observed since the behaviour of the exchange rate in its absence cannot be known. However, there are a number of ways of assessing it indirectly. The best known is the Friedman “profits test”. Friedman (1953) argued that a central bank which was stabilising the exchange rate would tend to buy foreign exchange when its price was low, and sell when its price is high, and hence its operations would be profitable. This paper applies the profits test to the Bank’s foreign exchange operations since the exchange rate was floated. The main conclusion is that over this period the Bank’s foreign exchange operations have produced total profits of around $A3.4 billion, suggesting that intervention has tended to be stabilising. Other statistical tests developed by Wonnacott (1982) and Mayer and Taguchi (1983), also presented in this paper, support this conclusion."

Inter-country comparisons are drawn among the levels of wage dispersion over time, and the relationship between wages and demand conditions for labour, including productivity and relative prices, are examined. We observe that no strong systematic relationship exists between wage dispersion and the degree of centralisation of labour market institutions.

The calculations suggest that the manufacturing; mining; transport, storage and communication and recreation, personal and other services sectors have sufficient capital installed to increase employment. In another sector, wholesale and retail trade, the potential for increases in employment through increased capital utilisation may be constrained by surplus labour (as of June 1993). While some sectors, e.g. community services, are capital constrained at the moment, we find that the investment requirements to increase employment in these sectors are not onerous. We also project investment requirements in each of the sectors for employment growth over the next five years. These projections suggest that a jump in investment followed by relatively modest growth is required to sustain growth in employment."

Establishing a link between cash flows, leverage and investment provides insights into the way that monetary policy and cyclical factors more generally influence the corporate sector. If cash flows are an important determinant of investment, then changes in monetary policy (by changing interest rates) will influence investment through a cash flow effect as well as through altering the rate at which the returns to investment are discounted. If this is the case, the higher leverage of the corporate sector implies, other things being equal, that monetary policy may have a larger impact on investment than in the past. Furthermore, it suggests that the effects of monetary policy will be felt unevenly across the corporate sector. The cash flows of highly geared firms will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than cash flows of firms with minimal leverage. In this paper we use panel-data analysis to examine the impact of financial factors on investment decisions of firms in the Australian corporate sector. We find strong support for the influence of financial factors on investment decisions. Leverage, internally-generated cash flows, and the stock of cash and liquid financial assets are all important influences on investment behaviour, particularly for smaller firms, highly leveraged firms, and firms with high retention ratios."

The share of both investment and employment in import competing industries has, on the other hand, fallen. These changes in the sectoral allocation of resources are consistent with the specialisation in production that accompanies international integration."

It emphasises how the interaction between the allocation of household wealth and the financing needs of firms shape the structure and evolution of financial systems. The paper focuses on the experiences of banks, and argues that as the 1990s proceed they will face increased competition on both sides of their balance sheets. However, several factors are likely to provide banks some competitive advantage. The most important is that a large pool of borrowers cannot raise funds other than through banks. On the asset side of their balance sheets, the intermediation of funds to small and medium-sized businesses is thus a core function which differentiates banks from other financial institutions and the securities markets generally. But banks also have advantages on the liabilities side of their balance sheets, as they offer depositors a safe and highly liquid repository for their funds. The paper argues that the extent to which banks remain the institutional core of the financial system will depend on their ability to perform their traditional lending role. It concludes by speculating about the implications for the stability of the financial system of the structural changes which have occurred."

More recently, asset prices, particularly commercial property prices, have fallen significantly. The effect of these changes on balance sheets, and their implications for the business cycle, have generated considerable interest among academics and policy makers. In this paper, we review recent theoretical models that link the evolution of the business cycle to changes in firm equity. This link arises out of the asymmetry of information between borrowers and lenders and between managers and owners. These asymmetries lead to distortions in decision making which affect both the supply of and demand for credit, and ultimately investment and output. Deteriorations in the net worth of corporations and financial institutions are likely to lead to a reduction in both credit demand and supply and to an amplification of the business cycle. We develop a simple model in which the information problems between risk-averse management and the firm’s owners lead to investment decisions that depend upon the financial condition of the firm. We also review the Australian evidence of the importance of balance sheet strength on the availability of finance. Empirical results suggest that asset price inflation or increases in corporate equity, even after controlling for general business conditions, lead to finance becoming easier to obtain. This suggests that a collapse of asset prices, or an aggregate demand shock that reduces firms’ equity, will result in decreased supply of external finance."

In this paper, an attempt is made to reconcile the two forms of the real exchange rate, both in theory and in practice. It is shown analytically that under certain restrictive conditions they will be equivalent. These conditions are, however, not always met so that in practice the two forms of the real exchange rate diverge. Changes in the productivity of the traded goods sector and the terms of trade are shown to be the principal sources of divergence.

We find that many companies have significantly improved their balance sheets in this time. Leverage has been reduced, and this, coupled with lower nominal interest rates, has improved the interest cover and cash flows of the corporate sector. For many firms, the process of balance sheet repair has proceeded a long way so that the extent to which the financial position of firms will impinge on investment is much lower than it was a few years ago. However, in the short term, some focus on financial restructuring may remain given the extent of excess capacity in the economy and a shift in incentives away from debt financing. Looking further ahead, it appears that the rate of return to investing in capital is relatively high, at least when judged against the standards of earlier downturns. As the recovery picks up pace we should, therefore, see firms more inclined to expand their capital expenditure and less focused on financial restructuring."

In part, these changes have been made possible by the application of increasingly sophisticated inventory management techniques. The paper also argues that the behaviour of inventories is consistent with demand shocks being a principal source of business cycle fluctuations. This is in contrast to a number of recent papers that have argued that shocks to the cost of production are the driving force of the inventory and output cycles.

This paper attempts to uncover some of the causes for this structural deterioration, in terms of the factors affecting the UV relationship. We find that the Beveridge Curve shifted out around 1974, consistent with an increase in the equilibrium rate of unemployment which is generally agreed to have occurred around that time. Using gross labour market flow data, we also investigate the determinants of the equilibrium Beveridge Curve in the 1980s. We find that the Beveridge Curve shifted further outwards in the 1980s. The most important determinant of this shift was the decline in the search effectiveness of the unemployed, reflected in the increasing incidence of long-term unemployment. Offsetting this influence during this time was the declining labour force participation of men, and the very large increases in female employment."

The likelihood of bank failure depends on two factors: (i) the variability of bank income (which primarily reflects the variability of the rate of return on bank assets), and (ii) the capacity of a bank to absorb losses in the short run (which depends on bank capital). Accounting measures of the volatility of the rate of return on bank assets and bank capital ratios may not reflect the appropriate economic concepts. In this paper, we use share price data to calculate the economic values of Australian bank asset volatilities, capital ratios and the potential public sector liability which might arise as a result of claims by depositors of a failed bank. The public sector liability is found to be extremely small. We find that the estimated capital ratio for the Australian banking sector has risen over the past decade, while there has been no noticeable increase in the riskiness of banks.

Volatility in the Australian dollar/US dollar exchange rate is most closely linked with volatility measures of the US dollar/Canadian dollar rate, and volatility in Australian long-term bond yields is most closely linked to volatility measures of long term German bond returns. The results indicate that asset markets in a small open economy can adapt in different ways during periods of high or increasing volatility. The ways in which domestic volatility measures react to foreign turbulence, and the ways in which domestic returns correlate with international returns, depend on the particular circumstances (such as transactions costs and degree of risk aversion) which prevail in each financial market."

We find that equilibrium unemployment rose because of the economy’s inability to adjust to the adverse shocks of the time; employment contracted in some sectors but did not expand sufficiently in others. In answer to the second question, we find that the sources of persistence are different for men and women. Male unemployment has been persistent because, following a recession, employment is created in female dominated sectors, rather than the male dominated sectors which experienced the greatest decline in employment. Female unemployment has been persistent because the growth in the demand for female labour has been matched by the growth in its supply.

It is suggested that arguments to make asset price inflation an explicit objective of monetary policy are not helpful. The paper goes to point out some encouraging new trends in Australia’s linkages with the rest of the world. Export performance has been greatly enhanced by longer-term reforms and exchange rate depreciation during the 1980s."

These are the introduction of the Capital Gains Tax (CGT), dividend imputation and the taxation of the earnings of superannuation funds. In this paper we examine the determinants of a company’s dividend policy and within this framework look at how these tax changes have influenced dividend payments. We present some empirical results that suggest that both cash flow and tax considerations are significant determinants of dividend behaviour. Real dividends per share increased by about 38 per cent between 1985/86 and 1990/91. We estimate that the tax changes account for a rise in real dividends per share of about 20 per cent during that period."

 """,1992.,A Contingent Claim Analysis of Risk-based Capital Standards for Banks,"rdp9210, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Many countries are implementing capital adequacy standards developed under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which explicitly link each bank’s minimum capital-to-asset ratio to the riskiness of its operations. In this paper, we use a contingent claim framework to examine the general questions of what goals a risk-based capital framework might be designed to achieve and how risk-based standards might be expected to influence bank behaviour. We identify two related but distinct regulatory policy goals, and derive a capital adequacy rule to achieve each goal: a liability-value (LV) rule designed to limit the contingent liability borne by the deposit guarantor per dollar of deposits; and a failure-probability (FP) rule designed to limit the probability of bank insolvency. We show that an LV rule is likely to push banks toward low-risk, low-capital combinations, whereas an FP rule is likely to encourage high risk and high capital ratios. The results suggest that restrictions on bank asset holdings and on overall financial leverage may be desirable in conjunction with risk-based capital standards. We then consider the extent to which the BIS standards reflect either an FP or an LV approach to capital regulation. The BIS standards assign risk weights to various types of assets, and establish a minimum ratio of capital to the sum of risk-weighted assets. We find that a BIS-type standard with appropriately chosen weights could be an extremely close approximation to a rule designed to achieve either goal, but that the actual weightings contained in the accord are most consistent with an FP rule. However, we show that the weight assigned to riskless assets should be negative if regulatory goals make an LV rule desirable; we also find that under either LV or FP rules the weight given to risky assets probably should be substantially higher than established in the BIS agreement. The optimal weights also depend on the typical range of risks in bank portfolios. Since this range may vary from one financial system to the next, it may be desirable to retain a degree of national discretion in setting the precise weightings."

During a “credit crunch” loans from financial intermediaries are unobtainable at any price, so that credit may have a “causal” role in influencing economic outcomes in the short run. Tests of this phenomenon show that it is not supported by the Australian data. However, while credit may not “cause” economic activity it may, nevertheless, have useful leading indicator properties. This is because the demand for credit is based on expectations about future demand as well as the current cost of credit. Indeed, monetary policy operates in part via intertemporal substitution in demand, which is reflected in, though not caused by, the behaviour of credit. These properties of credit are shown to be broadly consistent with Australian data."

 """,1992.,Loan Rate Stickiness: Theory and Evidence,"rdp9206, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Financial deregulation in the 1980s saw the lifting of regulations on interest rates charged by banks. In general, lending rates now respond more quickly to changes in banks’ cost of funds than they did in the regulated period. However, lending rates still do not always move one for one with changes in banks’ marginal cost of raising funds. This paper canvasses four theoretical explanations, other than collusive behaviour, for loan rate stickiness. These theories are based on equilibrium credit rationing, switching costs, implicit risk sharing and consumer irrationality. Using regression analysis, we also examine the degree of stickiness of Australian interest rates on secured and unsecured personal loans, credit cards, small and large business overdrafts, and housing loans. We find significant differences in the degree of interest rate stickiness among the different rates, even after allowing for lags in adjustment. The rate on credit cards is found to be the most sticky, followed by personal loan rates, the housing loan rate and the small business overdraft rate. The large business overdraft rate is found to adjust one for one with banks’ marginal cost of funds. We briefly examine the behaviour of selected U.S., U.K. and Canadian interest rates. The general order and magnitude of interest rate stickiness is similar to that found for Australia. Although it is not possible to empirically discriminate between the different theories of loan rate stickiness, we interpret the results as providing strong evidence for the switching cost explanation. In addition, implicit risk sharing probably plays an important role in the stickiness of the housing loan rate."

The paper suggests that any conclusions drawn about intertemporal trends or international comparisons of the cost of capital should be treated with care.

It argues that the existence of sticky prices allows current and expected future monetary shocks to affect the slope of both the nominal and the real yield curves. Changes in real money balances brought about by monetary policy cause a strong liquidity effect at the short end of the yield curve. This results in changes in real output in the short/medium term which eventually get translated into changes in prices. The empirical results show that the spread between the 10 year Treasury bond and the 180 day bank bill predict the rate of change, over the subsequent one to two years, of a number of measures of real activity. Over both longer and shorter forecast horizons the spread has little predictive power. On the inflation front, the 10 year-180 day yield spread provides significant information about changes in inflation over the medium term (that is between one year and two and three years). Yield spreads between shorter dated securities are found to contain little information concerning future changes in inflation. This supports the view that at the shorter end of the yield curve changes in nominal rates often reflect changes in real rates."

This paper develops a theoretical model which allows for increased globalisation and integration of international financial markets in a world where goods markets are not perfectly integrated. Both cumulated current account balances and real interest differentials may be non-stationary within this framework. Appropriate portfolio diversification as net foreign asset positions diverge implies that the real exchange rates should be cointegrated with real interest differentials and net foreign asset (or liability) positions. Thus, for example, a cumulating overall current account surplus should lead to long-run appreciation of a country’s bilateral real exchange rate with any other country (given expected net returns) for portfolio diversification reasons. Real interest differentials, on the other hand, have an ambiguous impact on long-run real exchange rates. Empirical tests of this model show that three out of four major real exchange rates are cointegrated with these “fundamentals” variables. The underlying assumptions of the model – increasing financial integration and lack of goods market equilibrium – are supported by a series of supplementary tests."

This fact makes it hard to argue that growth of the superannuation sector came at the expense of other types of financial intermediaries. The relative stability of members’ contributions also helps to explain why superannuation has not yet had a noticeable effect on the level of private saving."

Specifically, it decomposes monthly movements in Australia’s real exchange rate into a transitory and a permanent component. The transitory component is identified with changes in the unobservable ex ante short-term real interest differential. The permanent component is denoted as changes in the unobservable long-run equilibrium real exchange rate. A state space model provides the framework for the treatment of these unobservable components and the traditional assumptions of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates and no cross-currency risk premium are relaxed. The ex ante real interest differential is found to explain very little of the month-to-month movement in the real exchange rate. However, given that the Australian data fails to unambiguously support the existence of a risk premium in the foreign exchange market, the model collapses to an uncovered interest parity relation which finds little empirical support in the literature. These results imply that the model’s assumption of rational expectations and hence, an efficient market in foreign exchange, may be inappropriate for describing the monthly variation in Australia’s real exchange rate."

The real exchange rate exhibits non-stationary behaviour over this period, in contrast to simple purchasing power parity theory. We find weak evidence that the real exchange rate exhibits a stable long run relationship with the terms of trade. There is no stable long run relationship between the real exchange rate and either short or long real interest differentials between Australia and its major trading partners. Since the float of the Australian dollar and the world-wide deregulation of financial markets, we find some evidence that the real exchange rate exhibits a stable relationship with the terms of trade alone, and with long real interest differentials alone. The evidence for a stable relationship is clearest with long real interest differentials. After the float, we also find evidence that the terms of trade and long real interest differentials together help to explain the Australian real exchange rate. We estimate the number of independent long run relationships between the real exchange rate, the terms of trade and long real interest differentials and, for some specifications, find evidence of two independent relationships. Since the float, our best estimates are that a 1 per cent improvement in the terms of trade leads to an appreciation of the Australian real exchange rate of about 0.3 to 0.5 per cent, while an increase of 1 percentage point in the differential between Australian and world long real interest rates is associated with an appreciation of the Australian real exchange rate of about 2 to 3½ per cent."

There is evidence that Australian stockmarket returns show more risk than would be justified by the relatively low debt/equity ratios of Australian companies. Furthermore, real earnings in Australia appear to have been relatively risky when measured against the benchmark of world earnings.

The paper then discusses some explanations for this observation – why might we expect to see higher real interest rates in high inflation countries and why has this only occurred in the 1980s. Finally the paper uses a simple test to attempt to distinguish between competing explanations of the positive inflation/real interest rate relationship. Unfortunately, the test cannot distinguish conclusively between the competing hypotheses."

We also consider the cases where the investor ignores the covariance between returns sourced in different countries, and where the investor makes unsystematic mistakes when forming expectations of exchange rate changes. We demonstrate that the expected utility cost of sub-optimal behaviour is generally very small. Thus, for example, if investors adjust portfolio shares every three months, they incur an average expected utility loss equivalent to about 0.16% p.a. It is therefore plausible that slight opportunity costs of frequent optimization may outweigh the benefits. This result may help explain the failure of uncovered interest parity."

This paper argues that these high real rates are a consequence of the interaction between the relatively high inflation and a tax system which taxes nominal income. The paper then explains how these high real rates can persist in a world with free global capital flows. We argue that foreign lenders find Australian nominal assets attractive, and their demand for them appreciates the Australian real exchange rate. However, foreign demand for Australian nominal assets is not insatiable. Having driven up the Australian real exchange rate, foreigners eventually conclude that the excess return on the high Australian interest rates is offset by the possibility that the overvaluation of the real exchange rate will unwind. The paper formalizes these ideas in a model."

The first two of these effects work in the direction of overstating taxable income, while the third works in the opposite direction.

The subject matter is divided into three broad areas: a description of trends in saving and investment (Section 2); a discussion of the basic determinants of private saving rates (Section 3) and a discussion of the role of saving-investment imbalances in the determination of the current account (Section 4). A central finding of the paper is that gross private saving rates when adjusted for inflation have been quite stable over a period of at least three decades. This is in contrast to the somewhat misleading impression given by movements in the conventionally quoted household saving ratio, which has been in steady decline since the mid 1970s. The short-term behaviour of private saving appears to be qualitatively well explained by simple principles of consumption smoothing, whereby the saving ratio moves inversely with income. However, evidence from both time series and cross sectional data suggests that consumption is more closely correlated with income over longer time periods than would be predicted by conventional theoretical models. In inflation adjusted terms, the private sector has typically been in deficit, investing more than it saves. Two main explanations are offered for these persistent deficits: first, the effect of Australia’s relatively high population growth on the demand for capital and secondly the presence of certain tax distortions (such as those arising from the interaction of inflation with the tax system) which tend to encourage capital importing. It is likely that both factors are important in explaining private sector deficits. Saving levels in the public sector have shown much larger swings than have occurred in the private sector. Public saving rates fell dramatically in the mid 1970s and did not recover until a decade later. Although the public sector financing requirement has been dramatically shifted into surplus in the second half of the 1980s, this result has been achieved at lower levels of public saving and investment than were typical prior to the mid 1970s."

In particular, it identifies the factors that underpinned the persistently high current account deficits experienced during the decade. In doing so, it attempts to reconcile two approaches to analysing the current account. The first, partial equilibrium approach, focuses on imports and exports and their proximate causes, expenditure and relative prices. The second approach considers the current account in a general setting with it being a reflection of domestic investment and saving. The paper also considers the issue of longer term adjustment. In particular, it examines the role of the exchange rate in that adjustment process. The paper argues that the factors influencing the current account deficit shifted over the course of the decade. The low level of national saving (which was largely due to the decline in public asving) underpinned the deficit in the first half of the decade. This was exacerbated by two shocks. The first, in 1981/82, being the investment phase of the resources boom following OPEC II. The second being the fall in the terms of trade commencing in 1985. Despite a large depreciation of the exchange rate, a sunstantial contraction of fiscal policy and subsequently a large rise in the terms of trade, the current account showed little sustained narrowing in the second half of the decade. This can largely be explained by a rise in private investment associated with the increased profitability of the corporate sector. The rise in the terms of trade was not reflected in increased saving and therefore an improvement in the current account. These factors placed upward pressure on income, expenditure and the real exchange rate. The monetary policy tightening, commencing in early 1988, may have exacerbated this exchange rate rise. This tightening was necessary, nevertheless, for domestic anti-inflationary objectives. The rise in the current account deficit and external debt during the decade was facilitated by Australia’s more complete integration into world financial markets. The abolition of exchange controls and the development of offshore markets in $A denominated securities gave domestic residents greater recourse to foreign savings to finance their expenditures. Also, the abolition of exchange controls led to a switch to debt rather than equity finance. This directly contributed to the rise in foreign debt."

 """,1998.,Policy Rules for Open Economies,"rdp9806, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper examines the choice of a monetary policy rule in a simple macroeconomic model. In a closed economy, the optimal policy is a ‘Taylor rule’ in which the interest rate depends on output and inflation. In an open economy, the optimal rule changes in two ways. First, the policy instrument is a ‘Monetary Conditions Index’ – a weighted average of the interest rate and the exchange rate. Second, on the right side of the rule, inflation is replaced by ‘long-run inflation’, a variable that filters out the transitory effects of exchange-rate movements. The model also implies that pure inflation targeting is dangerous in an open economy, because it creates large fluctuations in exchange rates and output. Targeting long-run inflation avoids this problem and produces a close approximation to the optimal instrument rule."

 """,2023.,The Impact of Interest Rates on Bank Profitability: A Retrospective Assessment Using New Cross-country Bank-level Data,"rdp2023-05, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper provides a retrospective assessment of the relationship between bank profitability and interest rates, focusing on the period when rates were very low or negative. To do this we use new confidential bank-level data covering about 1,500 banks operating in 10 banking systems, with most samples spanning the two decades up to the end of 2019. Our analysis confirms the empirical regularity that declining interest rates reduce banks' net interest margins. However, we find a smaller effect than in previous studies: on average across countries, a 100 basis point fall in short-term interest rates results in a 5 basis point decline in net interest margins in the short run. Notably, there are substantial cross-country differences, and, in some cases, the estimated effect is greater. Importantly, the effect of lower interest rates on net interest margins is larger than the effect on assets returns, suggesting that banks can shield overall profitability in the face of lower interest rates. For example, lower interest rates alleviate debt-servicing burdens and are associated with a fall in provisions set aside to cover losses on loans. There is therefore no one-size-fits-all result for the impact of low interest rates on overall profitability: in some jurisdictions banks maintained their level of profitability as the beneficial impact of lower rates on loan-loss provisions and other factors, including an increased focus on cost efficiencies and streamlining business models, materially offset the drag from lower interest margins."

In this paper, I develop a simple theoretical model of current account and exchange rate determination to examine these issues. I find that a debt trap, meaning a situation where the income available for repayment of the debt is lower than the interest on the debt, can exist in only the most implausible of circumstances. Therefore, a current account deficit can be expected to eventually correct itself without policy intervention. However, the conclusion that non-intervention is the optimal policy depends on the assumption that the real exchange rate adjusts continuously to equate actual and desired savings. When the real exchange rate is slow to adjust to its equilibrium value, social welfare will be increased by a fiscal policy that alters the dynamic path of the current account."

We find that movements in total and endogenous imports are well explained by movements in domestic demand, the relative price of imports, the relative price of exports, and the level of overtime. The demand for imports is found to be more responsive to changes in demand than to changes in prices, although movements in prices have an impact on import demand over a longer period of time. Our models explain almost all of the rapid growth of imports over the period from September 1986 to September 1989, and over this period we find that the contribution to growth in imports of relative prices outweighs that of demand."

 """,1989.,Capital Flows and Exchange Rate Determination,"rdp8908, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper attempts to examine the effects of increased capital mobility on exchange rate determination in Australia. In particular, it examines the issue of whether increased capital mobility has made the exchange rate so responsive to short-term financial market considerations that it no longer responds to longer-term fundamentals. The findings of the paper are consistent with the stylised facts of the international experience of floating exchange rates. The paper concludes that short-term capital flows are very interest sensitive but that the extent of this sensitivity is difficult to show empirically. Over the longer term, it appears that inflation differentials explain part of the movement of the nominal exchange rate. However, there have also been large movements of the real exchange rate. These fluctuations have been associated with shifts in Australia’s terms of trade and commodity prices. The paper finds that commodity price shocks also explain some of the short-run volatility of the exchange rate. This long-run and short-run link between the exchange rate and commodity prices is one of the distinguishing features of the Australian dollar. Finally, it was difficult to find and quantify any systematic link between the current account and the exchange rate. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the policy implications of highly mobile capital. It is noted that in a country with a floating exchange rate and perfectly mobile capital, there is scope for a conflict between internal and external balance, particularly if there is high inflation and current account deficits. The paper notes that monetary policy should primarily be directed towards lowering the rate of inflation rather than achieving a particular exchange rate objective for current account purposes. This is particularly true when the currency is subject to export price shocks since exchange rate movements help to buffer the impact of those shocks."

We use the model to examine the consequences for the housing market of the removal of the capital gains tax, a cut in income tax rates, a rise in real interest rates and an increase in the rate of goods price inflation. One key result is that changes in the inflation rate will cause changes in real prices and in housing investment even when real interest rates and demand are constant. This is due to the distortions caused by taxing and allowing tax deductions based on nominal interest. We simulate a policy change where the tax base is altered so that tax is levied on real interest only and find that under this regime real prices and activity are not influenced by changes in the inflation rate."

The analysis is presented using a neoclassical dynamic model.

The first concerns the choice of target, and specifically the choice between inflation and nominal income targets. The second issue concerns the distinction between targets with and without “base drift”. It is concluded that nominal income targeting produces lower output variability than an inflation target, but has an ambiguous effect on inflation variability. The case for allowing base drift in targets depends on whether or not anticipated policy is neutral; since base drift is essentially a revision to targets based on past information, allowance of base drift can only have an effect on output stability when anticipated policy in non-neutral. In this case, the analysis suggests that targets with base drift may produce more stable output paths than those without."

It aims to supplement an earlier paper by Bullock, Morris and Stevens (1988) (BMS), which explored these issues. BMS tentatively concluded that short-term interest rates and the narrow aggregate M1 had a reasonably good leading relationship with private final demand. Broad monetary and credit aggregates tended to be lagging indicators, and the intermediate aggregates (M3 and bank lending) presented a mixed picture. This earlier paper relied on simple graphical and correlation-based techniques to draw these conclusions. The same questions are addressed in this paper, this time using more rigorous statistical testing techniques. Vector auto-regression (VAR) analysis is used to identify leading and lagging relationships among the data. All data are pre-tested for the presence of deterministic trends and unit roots, and differenced and detrended accordingly, before the models are estimated. Estimation is over the period 1969–1988 (given available data), using seasonally adjusted quarterly series. Results confirm that the broader aggregates generally lag activity, however there is no strong evidence of a leading relationship between the short-term interest rate (or M1) and activity. The latter suggests a complex relationship between interest rates and activity over time; a process influenced by the operation of monetary policy, which cannot be satisfactorily unravelled using the techniques employed here. The data set of BMS is also extended in this paper to allow a preliminary examination of the tradeable goods sector. Models including the exchange rate, foreign demand and prices, as well as domestic activity and financial variables are estimated. Results from these tests suggest an effect of the exchange rate on imports and exports, which is consistent with a link between monetary policy and the tradeable goods sector."

Under the joint null hypothesis that the pricing model is valid, and that forecasts are efficient, the implied volatilities calculated from observed option prices should be efficient predictors of squared changes in the prices of the underlying instruments. This hypothesis is tested using weekly data on prices of Australian financial futures options, and over-the-counter currency options. The results indicate significant forecasting biases for each of the contracts studied. In each case, implied volatilities appear to overpredict changes in the true volatility of underlying prices. Although these conclusions are conditional on the validity of the pricing model used to calculate implied volatilities, our evidence suggests that biases in the Black-Scholes formula are unlikely to explain fully the apparent forecast biases."

There is no evidence that the influence of short-term interest rates on long-term interest rates has become less pronounced; if anything, it is now stronger. These are the standard sorts of results one would expect for a country that has moved from a quasi fixed exchange rate to a floating exchange rate regime.

The textbook IS/LM models, that rely so heavily on a monetary transmission mechanism running from “money” to activity and prices, may no longer be the most appropriate theoretical models for analysing monetary policy in a deregulated world. Despite this breakdown in the traditional monetary transmission mechanism, it is argued in this paper that monetary policy will continue to be effective in a deregulated environment. Worries that there will be price-level indeterminacy, no yard-stick to measure the stance of policy, and no rules to make monetary policy accountable in a fully deregulated world are not justified. A reaction function which ties the nominal short-term interest rate to a nominal anchor should ensure a stable steady state outcome. There are a number of alternative nominal anchors from which to chose, including: nominal financial prices – the exchange rate or a long-term nominal interest rate; or more direct targets such as inflation or nominal GDP growth. Implementing such policy strategies in the short-run, however, will remain as difficult as ever and optimal strategies may vary across countries. It is nevertheless important that policy reaction functions be clearly stated and adhered to, both to ensure credibility and allow full accountability."

We develop the method to allow for the effects of income growth on the sustainability of deficits and critically appraise some of the methods used in previous studies and suggest improvements. Our finding is that over the period 1953/54 to 1986/87 there is no evidence of unsustainability of government debt.

This paper presents estimates of the relationship between employment, output and real wages over the past two decades. The study therefore covers three major episodes in the labour market: the contractions in employment in the mid 1970s and early 1980s and the strong growth since 1983. The paper finds that real wages have been an important influence on employment in Australia – on average, just as important as output.

The object of the present paper is to serve as an introduction to and description of some key empirical regularities, without seeking to describe how monetary policy exerts its influence, or how this may have changed under deregulation. Other papers are presently being prepared which will address these issues. The paper examines the relationship between a number of financial indicators and economic activity over the past two decades. The study focuses on private demand as an indicator of activity, and short-term interest rates and a number of financial aggregates as financial indicators. The paper examines these indicators both visually (graphically) and using simple correlation coefficients. While it does not claim to be definitive about causality, it does draw some conclusions about the strength and timing of relationships. In particular, it suggests that large movements in real demand are preceded by movements in interest rates. The evidence for monetary and credit aggregates is mixed. M1 consistently leads real demand (though this is probably not independent of interest rates). Other bank-based aggregates sometimes led in the 1970s, but no longer do so; the relationship for these aggregates has at times been unstable. Broader monetary and credit aggregates tend to lag real demand. In the case of nominal demand, the timimg of relationships is altered. The leading relationship of interest rates and M1 to nominal demand is longer than it is for real demand, and the lag from demand to broader aggregates is shorter. M3 and bank lending performed very well as leading indicators of nominal demand in the 1970s, but have since deteriorated. One consistent theme which comes through in the results is that interest rates are a reasonably good leading indicator of changes in demand, particularly real demand. This relationship has not weakened with deregulation; indeed, the statistical evidence suggests that it has strengthened."

The first concerns the hypothesis of market efficiency, which asserts that futures prices fully reflect available information about subsequent prices in the physical markets. Secondly, there is the question of whether or not futures trading has a detectable influence on the short-term variability of spot prices. A weekly data set, covering each of the three main SFE contracts over the period from December 1984 to February 1988, is used to investigate the two sets of hypotheses. Statistical results generally support the efficiency hypothesis, the one clear exception being the case of the pre-crash sample for the SPI contract; a significant average discount was found in this case, indicating that the futures market may have anticipated the subsequent crash. In investigating potential causal links from futures markets to physical markets, two main findings are obtained. First, no link is detected from futures trading volumes to spot price volatility; and secondly, the data suggest that futures price movements have tended to lead spot price movements during the sample period by between one and two weeks. It is argued that this result is consistent with conventional theory, which suggests that prices will react to new information most quickly in those markets where transactions costs are lowest."

In addition, an analysis of import prices finds no evidence of “absorption” by foreign suppliers, and suggests that Australian import prices could have fallen in 1986 if not for the depreciation. This finding is attributable to the falls in the world prices of tradeable goods in 1985 and 1986.

In testing the q theory we relax the implicit assumption that firms have unlimited access to capital markets, allowing a proportion of aggregate investment to be determined by current profits. Using standard capital stock data, the q theory performs poorly. However, the cost of adjustment model implies that the conventional capital stock data needs to be revised to allow for these adjustment costs. Once this is done, it is found that the q theory is empirically supported. For plausible values of the cost of adjustment, the results indicate that a lower bound of 10 percent of aggregate investment is explained by q theory and 90 per cent by current profits."

 """,1987.,Risk Effects Versus Monetary Effects in the Determination of Short-term Interest Rates,"rdp8708, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Economic theory offers two distinct approaches to the modelling of interest rates. At the microeconomic level, interest rates are modelled as an outcome of intertemporal optimisation by investors, so that real interest rates are determined entirely by the real variables that characterise risk. At the macroeconomic level, short term behaviour of interest rates is usually thought of as being governed by the money demand function. This paper tests a model that encompasses both views, using data for four countries. The results suggest that risk factors are empirically insignificant in explaining interest rate behaviour."

Other things being equal, the spread is an increasing function of the dealer’s uncertainty about what his customers know, and is a decreasing function of the variance of noise in the market. Empirically, this stylised result suggests that bid-ask spreads may be significant predictors of the distribution of future asset prices; this is supported using data for the Eurocurrency markets."

With an intuitive understanding of the algorithms, it is hoped that the technical source literature will be more readily accessible to model builders. The use of game theory in macroeconomics has also seen a resurgence. The second part of this paper develops an algorithm which is useful for solving rational expectations models and can also be used to solve dynamic games between agents with forward-looking expectations.

There is a perception that the current “non-system” has lead to macroeconomic policies in major countries which are counter-productive for the world as a whole. Indeed the question of reforming the world monetary system is a question of designing a set of “rules of the game” within which countries can persue their own national objectives and yet which still leads to some form of global coordination of macroeconomic policies. The issue of strategic interactions between countries has recently received some analytical insights with the application of game theory to the economics literature on interdependence between countries. The purpose of this paper is to survey these recent applications of static and dynamic game theory to the question of international policy coordination. It also surveys the results of the few empirical attempts to measure the potential gains to coordination."

 """,1987.,The Role and Consequences of Investment in Recent Australian Economic Growth,"rdp8704, Reserve Bank of Australia.","By international and historical standards, Australia does not appear to be under-capitalised. Nevertheless, the past decade has seen a clear reversal of the steady upward trend in capital intensity; this reversal was most marked after the short-lived increase in capital spending associated with improved prospects in Australia's resource-intensive industries in the early 1980s. Since then, there has been a sharp decline in investment relative to GDP, as reductions in real labour costs relative to capital costs encouraged the substitution of labour for capital. The existence of excess capacity in the early 1980s meant that substitution of labour for investment in new capital was possible without a major slowdown in growth of economic activity or employment. The prospects for continued economic growth depend, in part, on the resumption of investment spending to complement the growth of labour. It will be important for investment to occur in those industries where recent gains in competitiveness have been greatest. Prospects for achieving these outcomes will be enhanced if government policies are directed towards further reducing distortions in investment incentives, encouraging the expansion of technology and providing a mix of overall stabilisation policies that reduces pressures on capital markets."

Own rate effects have become more important in the recently-deregulated financial environment. Own interest rates are found to be very important in explaining all three aggregates, although it is found that there is no contemporaneous interest rate effect on BM. BM appears to have the most stable econometric relationship with income and interest rates of the three aggregates, with M3 remaining unstable despite the introduction of own rates to the equation. Own rate effects may enhance the efficiency of achieving low-inflation objectives by controlling money supply growth. Excessive interest sensitivity is reduced by the presence of own rates, as is the possibility of real interest rate overkill. While the BM equation is found to have desirable properties, the econometric results are preliminary. The results certainly do not support BM as a target variable, since the lag structure is complex with respect to interest rates. Targeting BM would amount to little more than targeting nominal income directly, which requires knowledge of a wide range of influences on GDP."

Apart from testing for stability in a general sense, particular emphasis is given to the first half of the 1980’s, where wide-ranging financing deregulation might be expected to affect relationships between the money stock, income and interest rates.

Wages are fully indexed to prices, and are optimally adjusted over time in response to steady state deviations of output and of inflation. Inflation deviations will arise if wage setters make contracts that take into account long term forces, fulfilling a “social contract”. When fiscal policy drives a wedge between long run and current inflation, it can have supply-side effects. If goods markets always clear and future inflation is perfectly foreseen, fiscal policy can have real supply-side effects. With only money finance, such effectiveness exists only if the economy has sufferred from an exogenous supply shock. If debt shares in the finance of fiscal deficits, real effects can be created even if the system is in steady state. The direction of the effects depend upon the extent to which fiscal policy is endogenised on account of the implied debt service. A fiscally cautious government will create net output gains after an expansion. If goods markets do not clear, and the price level (but not inflation) is sticky, supply-side fiscal policy can only operate in a Classical Unemployment region. In this region, fiscal expansion only affects inflation, and output is perpetually stuck."

Following the single country models, these international models yield restrictions on the moments of the price processes via the solution of asset market clearing conditions. This produces an International Capital Asset Pricing model, but it does not also deliver restrictions on the exchange rate processes. This paper shows that consideration of associated equilibrium conditions in the foreign exchange markets (which are inherent in the international version of the model) produces such restrictions, allowing full pricing of assets in the various currencies and exchange rates. However, it is also shown that the assumption of geometric Brownian motion for exchange rates is inconsistent with these restrictions. This suggests the need for further work to impose the additional equilibrium constraints in models with more flexible price processes."

The accuracy of the $A/US$ forecasts is compared with that of forecasts generated from a number of simple forecasting rules as well as forecasts of the US$/Yen exchange rate. In general, the simple forecasting rules provide superior forecasts to those provided by the individual market participants.

Further, the comparison of the US$/Yen forecasts with the $A/US$ forecast shows the former to be generally more accurate."

 """,1986.,Exchange Rate Regimes and the Volatility of Financial Prices: The Australian Case,"rdp8608, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Much has been written about the choice of exchange rate regimes from a theoretical perspective. A conclusion of this literature is that, ceteris paribus, interest rates should exhibit less volatility (and exchange rates more volatility) under a floating than under a fixed exchange rate regime. Equivalently, interest rates should be relatively easier (and exchange rates relatively harder) to predict (in the statistical sense) under a floating exchange rate. Further, the unexpected volatility in interest rates due to external impulses should be reduced, and that in exchange rates increased, relative to a fixed exchange rate regime. This study analyses the question of interest rate and exchange rate volatility before and after the floating of the Australian dollar in December 1983. The paper adopts an atheoretical methodology of vector autoregressions (VAR’s) to calculate the forecast-error variance for interest rates and exchange rates (at different horizons) and to decompose these forecast-error variances into those parts attributable to domestic and external sources. A VAR model is estimated for both the pre- and post-float periods, on daily data for the Australian trade-weighted index, the Australian 90 day bank accepted bill rate, the US trade-weighted index, the US 90 day prime bankers’ acceptances rate, the DM trade-weighted index, the West German 90 day interbank deposits rate, the Japanese trade-weighted index and the Japanese 90 day Gensaki rate. This is the minimum configuration that can capture both domestic and foreign sources of volatility in financial prices. The analysis supports the hypothesis that interest rates have become relatively less volatile (and the exchange rate relatively more volatile) with the move to a floating exchange rate regime. However, the evidence suggests that this has been due to a change in the nature of the relationship between the Autralian interest rate and exchange rate; rather than a shift in the incidence of external shocks. This supports the notion that a more independent monetary policy is possible under a floating exchange rate regime."

 """,1986.,The Expectations Theory of the Term Structure and Short-term Interest Rates in Australia,"rdp8607, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates states that the yields on financial assets of different maturities are related primarily by market expectations of future yields. The expectations theory has occupied a prominent place in both theoretical and policy debates at various times. However, extensive empirical work in the United States has soundly rejected the joint (testable) hypothesis of the expectations theory and zero (or a constant) risk premium. The aim of this paper is to test this joint hypothesis against Australian short-term interest rate data for the period since the introduction of the tender system for the sale of Treasury notes in 1979. The sample period chosen is interesting for a number of reasons. First, the market has had a greater influence on the determination of interest rates since the introduction of the tender system. Second, there was a major structural change in the Australian financial system with the floating of the Australian Dollar in 1983. This provides scope to test for the impact of policy or institutional changes on the expectations theory. The paper finds that the joint hypothesis of the expectations theory and zero (or a constant risk premium), cannot be rejected in this period. Furthermore, this joint hypothesis cannot be rejected in the period before or after the introduction of the float. There is however, evidence of parameter instability across the pre- and post-float periods."

The second is to present new estimates covering the 1980s, based partly on these earlier studies, which value all major components of the nation’s private wealth at their market value, or a close approximation. The calculations reported here represent the first aggregate Australian wealth series for which comprehensive market valuation can be claimed. Australia’s aggregate non-human private wealth was found to be $794 billion at 30 June 1985. The series as a whole suggests that previous estimates have significantly undervalued Australia’s wealth. At 30 June 1981, the Helliwell–Boxall (1978) study, updated by the Reserve Bank, reported a value of $294.7 billion, while Williams (1983) gave a value of $360.5 billion. The corresponding estimate for the new series is $533.0 billion. Because the new calculations presented here value wealth by component, it is possible to identify omissions and valuation differences which account for most of the variation between these estimates."

These changes have complicated both monetary analysis and the practice of monetary policy. Monetary models based on simple aggregative relationships are not well equipped to analyse issues of structural change. Monetary policy has been forced to rely more on “judgement” and less on the application of these models and their suggested policy rules. One obvious example of this is the demise, or at least downgrading, of monetary targets in major western economies. This survey examines some of the main strands in the development of monetary economics in the past two decades. It argues that much of the policy prescription of monetary economics – especially reliance on monetary targeting – depends on simple “stylised facts” about the behaviour of regulated economies. These prescriptions cannot therefore be applied directly to economies where the regulatory structure is changing. Policy approaches such as Australia’s current use of a “check list” of indicators are discretionary to the extent that they involve judgements about the relative importance of different indicators. But it is argued that this discretionary approach develops, rather than overthrows, the previous approach."

We also examine the intertemporal relationships between the various variables to determine which (if any) of the variables the leading indexes in fact lead. The results indicate that the two leading indexes are quite useful in forecasting their associated indexes of the business cycle. One of the leading indexes is, however, a lagging indicator of its coincident index. The results for individual activity variables are mixed. The evidence suggests that the leading indexes are useful in forecasting GDP, an index of production and employment related variables. They are not useful in forecasting either retail sales or motor vehicle registrations."

 """,1986.,"Risk Premia, Market Efficiency and the Exchange Rate: Some Evidence Since the Float","rdp8603, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The Australian dollar was floated in December 1983. Since that time the exchange rate has become more volatile and has depreciated significantly. The aim of this paper is to examine the behaviour of the foreign exchange market since the float. In particular, the paper considers whether the joint hypotheses underlying the notion of speculative efficiency – namely market efficiency and risk neutrality – hold in the post-float forward market. Under the speculative efficiency hypothesis, the forward exchange rate is a rational expectation of the future spot exchange rate. The paper examines this speculative efficiency hypothesis for forward rates of different maturities, by examining whether the forward rate provides the best available forecast of the future spot rate. The paper endeavours to make full use of the data available by sampling more finely than the contract interval. This procedure, however, involves some econometric difficulties. In particular, the residuals from OLS estimation will be serially correlated, following a low order moving average process. Consequently, the estimated standard errors will be inconsistent. To overcome this, the relevant equations are estimated by first obtaining consistent parameter estimates by OLS and then estimating a consistent asymptotic covariance matrix. The findings of the paper can be summarised as follows. For the post-float period as a whole, the speculative efficiency hypothesis can be rejected for the 30-day forward market but not for the 15-day and 90-day forward markets. However, some evidence of parameter instability is found. In particular, there is evidence of a structural break in several of the reported equations after February 1985; the time of the first major depreciation. For the period after February 1985, each of the markets was found to be speculatively inefficient, in the sense that other available information improves upon the forecast of the future spot rate that is provided by the forward rate. It must be stressed that due to the joint nature of the hypothesis it is impossible to state whether the observed deviations from this definition of speculative efficiency were due to market inefficiency (i.e., agents not using available information optimally) or risk aversion (i.e., risk averse speculators may drive a risk premium or wedge between the market’s expectation of the future spot rate and the current forward rate). Because of the limited sample period since the float it is difficult to conduct more sophisticated tests for the existence of particular forms of risk premia in the forward market."

 """,1986.,"Short-term Interest Rates, Weekly Money Announcements and Rational Forecasts","rdp8602, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Recently there have been a growing number of studies of the “money announcement” phenomenon. Towards the end of the week, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board announces its estimates of the narrowly defined monetary aggregate for the statement week ending some eight to ten days previously. The tendency for interest rates and other financial prices to respond to these “money announcements” has been well established. The importance of this phenomenon rests on the test it provides for the effect of monetary policy on real variables. However, existing tests incorporate at least two key assumptions. Firstly, that the Money Market Services, Inc. survey of market participants expectations is the best predictor (i.e., the rational expectation) of the weekly money announcement. Secondly, that the money announcement itself is the best predictor (i.e., the rational expectation) of the “true” change in the money supply (in practice, the true money supply is taken to be the final estimate after several data revisions). The analysis in this paper shows that both of these assumptions are rejected by the data. Readily available information can be used to improve upon both the Money Market Services forecast of the announcement and the Fed’s own preliminary estimate of the “true” money supply change. This information is used to estimate rational expectations of the change in the money stock, both with respect to information available just before the announcement and that available just after the announcement. Appropriate econometric techniques are used with these “generated regressors” to obtain consistent and efficient estimates of the announcement effect on short-term interest rates. This enables tests to be calculated to determine whether this effect, and/or the structure of the forecasts, change in response to changes in Fed policy or in its measurement of the announced monetary data."

 """,1986.,New Classical Models and Unobserved Aggregates,"rdp8601, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The New Classical macroeconomic models seek to explain observed cyclical fluctuations in real activity by agents’ reactions to nominal demand disturbances, about which they have incomplete information. While these models are driven by incomplete information about stochastic shocks, it is invariably assumed that agents have comprehensive information about the structure of the model, the associated probability distributions and the past values of all relevant variables. This paper analyses a simple New Classical model where agents cannot observe any lagged values of the true aggregate of an important variable – the money stock – but can see (lagged values of) an imperfectly measured estimate of this aggregate. Agents filter this noisy signal and all other available information to produce optimal estiimates (i.e., rational expectations) of the current and lagged aggregate money stocks. Analytically tractable expressions are obtained from the stationary solution to the inherent recursive Kalman filtering problem. It is found that, under fairly general conditions, this filtering process induces serially correlated errors into the agents’ expectations of the money stock, even though their expectations are rational. This serial dependence feeds through to generate a persistent response of real activity to demand shocks. Futhermore, it is shown that the correlation of unanticipated movements in the measured money stock with movements in real activity, may not be indicative of the relationship between activity and the true money stock. These results suggest that incomplete information about macroeconomic variables may explain some of the observed business cycle persistence and some of the instances of a lack of a sizeable measured correlation between real output and money supply innovations."

 """,1983.,Financial Innovations and Monetary Policy: A Preliminary Survey,"rdp8301, Reserve Bank of Australia.","This paper provides a survey of ways in which financial innovations may affect the making of monetary policy. This subject has recently become more topical because of both the increased importance of monetary policy and the increasing pace of financial innovation. The analysis makes use of the IS-LM framework. The discussion is by no means exhaustive or conclusive. However, it appears that in recent years there have been important factors which have altered the slope of the LM curve and others which have shifted it. A steeper LM curve increases the effectiveness of monetary policy and vice versa. Two developments in recent years (the growth in the number and range of financial intermediaries and the increased volatility of interest rates) have reduced the slope of the LM curve and one (the payment of market-related interest rates to more forms of deposit) has increased the slope. As regards the position of the LM curve, one could argue that the development of new transactions technologies would have reduced the demand for narrow money, shifting the relevant LM curve to the right. However, broader measures of money may not have been affected, or at least not to the same degree. Also, as innovation improves the efficiency of the whole financial system, the public might hold fewer financial assets for a given level of activity. This would also tend to shift the LM curve to the right. Shifts in the slope and position of the LM curve complicate the task of using the money supply as an intermediate target. Redefinitions of the money supply might correct for shifts in the LM curve (if the magnitudes of the shifts could be predicted or estimated) but such redefinitions cannot allow for factors which have altered the slope of the LM curve. For this and other reasons, financial innovation strengthens the need to examine a range of financial variables in formulating monetary policy."

Since the results of exercises of this type have often been inconclusive there is a need to establish what the methods can show about the relationships between variables and under what conditions one method might be able to give more reliable information on a given relationship than the other. The literature in the area of causality and prediction is quite extensive and is surveyed in section two of the paper to put the work reported here in perspective. In the main part of the paper, a relationship between a pair of variables is established using artificially generated data so that the properties of the methods can be abstracted from the properties of the data. Two types of causal relationships appear to be important in economies. The analysis presented here takes both types into account. The first envisages no particular theoretical framework relating the pair of variables being analysed while the second regards the two variables as being related within a theoretical framework. The results obtained suggest the following: (i) neither method is successful in all circumstances; (ii) unless explicit time lags are present between the variables neither method can tell us anything; (iii) the correlation approach can do a reasonable job of picking up the order of a lagged relationship provided the underlying generating process is not too complex. The spectral technique on the other hand cannot indicate the order of the lags but it is more successful than the correlation approach in detecting the presence of a lead or lag relationship when the generating process is allowed to become more complex."

There are two reasons for this study. First, there have been several changes in the institutional environment in which banks operate as a consequence of some deregulation and attempts by the financial sector to circumvent some regulation. Hence, there is a need to focus attention on a period in which government regulation is relatively homogeneous. Second, by using monthly data of reatively recent vintage some better idea of the dynamics of portfolio adjustment by the banks will be obtained. Previous studies have frequently made use of relatively long runs of quarterly data and, for the most part, have found lengthy adjustment lags. The estimated model comprises ten behavioural equations and one identity. There are equations for demand deposits, fixed deposits, negotiable certificates of deposit, overdraft advances and commercial bill acceptances, all of which have been modelled as being determined by the non-bank public. In turn, the banks are assumed to determine the supply of negotiable certificates of deposit, fully drawn loans, overdraft limits, bill acceptance limits and the stock of excess liquid assets (determined residually). There is also an equation for the interest rate on commercial bills. The dynamic simulation properties of the model are also reported, as are the results of three counterfactual experiments. Broadly speaking, the results support the theoretical model that is presented in an appendix. Adjustment by both the banks and the non-bank public is rapid, with most average lages being less than four months."

Changes in the financial system during the last two decades, including partial deregulation of the banking system, and the growth of finance companies and permanent building societies, suggest the need for a careful examination of the money/money base relationship. These changes are likely to have altered both the time series properties of the monetary aggregates and may also have changed the observed relationship between various measures of money base and the money stock. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that this may have occurred. The analysis is directed towards three questions. Does the money multiplier vary significantly in terms of its stability with differing measures of money and money base? What is the behavioural significance of differences in stability? How does the causal relationship between money and money base vary over time and with different concepts of base and money? Graphical, numerical and time series analysis are used to shed light on these issues. The results are in some cases conflicting due to the strigent techniques for determining causality but we conclude: • there is evidence of considerable instability in the money multiplier for most concepts of money base during the 60s and 70s. Financial innovation may have been important in this instability. The timing of significant changes in the financial system is consistent with observed instabilities of the multipliers; • the evidence suggests that the M2 money multiplier for the extended base is the most stable for both the sixties and seventies; • there is evidence of contemporaneous correlation between money base measures and the money stock (for M2 and M3) but that the results for the seventies indicate the presence of both a positive causal effect on the money supply from innovations in the money base and feedback effects from the money stock to money base; • there is evidence of some structural change in the time series models for some aggregates between the late sixties and the late seventies; in addition, there is evidence of a structural change within the sixties relating primarily to the private sector’s demand for cash relative to other monetary aggregates and to the growth of the permanent building societies."

 """,1982.,The Market for Negotiable Certificates of Deposit in Australia: 1973–1980,"rdp8202, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Liability management by the Australian trading banks is a relatively recent development, largely made possible by the inroduction of negotiable certificates of deposit (NCD’s). The market for NCD’s also acts as an important link in transmitting credit market disturbances to non-bank financial intermediaries. Relatively little attention has been paid to analysing the working of this market in Australia. This paper presents and estimates two models of the NCD market. In the first case the hypothesis of short term rationing, that arises from various restrictions on the operation of the market, is tested. The second model assumes that the market clears in the short run but adjusts with a lag to the desired long run position. Our results favour the second model. In addition, the demand for NCDs by the non-bank public depends on wealth and interest rates. The supply of NCD’s by the banks depends on the banks liquidity position and on interest rates. The results suggest that banks may use asset management instead of liability management when rates rise on liquid assets of the banks. Adjustment by the non-bank public to the long run demand is instantaneous, while the banks adjust with a lag. Our results suggest that approximately 84 per cent of the adjustment in the banks’ supply occurs within one year."

A simple theoretical model is presented to illustrate the point that, if all assets are treated symmetrically, the method chosen to finance a government budget deficit is of little consequence to macroeconomic activity relative to the effects of the deficit itself. This simple model is then expanded into a portfolio model consisting of money, government bonds, bank advances and foreign liabilities. Two versions of this portfolio model are derived. One is based on the assumption that portfolios adjust slowly. The other version is based on the assumption that portfolios adjust instantaneously. These two portfolio models are incorporated into a recent version of the RBII model of the Australian economy. The two resulting models are estimated as part of the full system of equations which is then used to simulate a number of monetary and fiscal shocks. The results suggest that budget deficits appear to be a main cause of inflation and the method used to finance these deficits may only be of secondary importance. It also appears that ‘monetary disequilibrium’ in the RBII model is a reasonable approximation to a more complicated adjustment process arising from changes in wealth."

It does this using simulation and eigenvalue analysis of the RBA79 model of the Australian economy. Use of this model allows for a much wider range of interactions between the domestic economy and the balance of payments than has so far been attempted in theoretical work or in empirical analysis of single equations. Responses of key macro-economic variables are examined under a range of domestic and external shocks. It is shown that these responses can vary substantially depending on assumptions about: - the exchange rate regime; - the speed of adjustment of capital flows; and - the speed by which expectations about changes in the exchange rate adjust to information about relative prices. Specifically it is found that, in the RBA79 model, a flexible exchange rate produces instability if capital flows adjust sluggishly to changes in income, interest rates and expectations about the exchange rate. For this reason, a managed float may be desirable if capital flows are slow to adjust. If capital flows adjust rapidly, however, a much more flexible exchange rate is possible and contributes to the control of money and inflation in the model without additional detrimental effects on unemployment or output. The paper is intended mainly to illustrate the implication of assumptions and to stimulate further work rather than to make assertions either about the nature of reactions in the Australian economy or about exchange rate management in Australia."

It also offers some possible explanations for continued weakness in the demand for labour in Australia in the second half of the 1970s. In the period reviewed, the main feature of the labour market in Australia is considerably lower growth in employment in the period from 1974/75. The drop in growth in employment was concentrated in private industries and growth in the number of females employed fell relative to growth in male employment. Although average growth in the labour force fell at the same time, the unemployment rate rose to its highest level during the post-war period. The overall worsening in conditions in the labour market was preceded by a sharp drop in corporate profitability. This owed importantly to government policies - the introduction of the Prices Justification Tribunal, for example - and excessive real wage increases. Lower profitability was reflected in lower growth in economic activity and, therefore, in the demand for labour. The relative drop in female employment followed large increases in female wages relative to those of males. The increased relative wages of females, which seemed largely to be due to decisions of industrial tribunals rather than market influences, was an important factor influencing changes in female employment in the late 1970s. The coincidence of these changes suggests that moves in factor shares and in relative wages were important influences on the labour market in Australia in the second half of the 1970s."

 """,1981.,Overdraft Lending and Aggregating Demands Subject to Constraint,"rdp8102, Reserve Bank of Australia.","An overdraft is a lending instrument, usually offered by banks, that for a predetermined period allows the borrower to overdraw his account up to a predetermined limit. The timing and size of withdrawals is at the discretion of the borrower except, of course, when the credit limit is reached. Lending by Australian banks is predominantly by overdrafts and some attention has been focussed in the past on explaining the behaviour of overdraft advances. Individual demands for credit can therefore be characterised as censored (that is, subject to an upper limit). In practice there are only aggregate data for advances by overdrafts, which creeates difficulties for estimating the behavioural parameters for the demand for advances by overdraft. This paper develops a theory of aggregation of a group of individual demands that are each censored. A measure of credit rationing can also be derived from the approach. The approach is implemented using Australian data for three classes of business borrowers. The results support the view that the observed aggregate quantity of advances by overdraft is determined by both supply and demand factors. This finding is consistent with earlier work by researchers using Australian data. The significance of the present results lies in the attention paid to aggregation and the implications this has for the specification of the estimating equations. A second benefit of the approach is that it permits direct estimation of the distribution of rationed credit demands. The correctly aggregated equation specifies the observed stock of advances as a weighted average of constrained and unconstrained demands for credit, where the weights are interpreted as the probability that an individual borrower faces a binding credit limit. In that limited sense the probability measure, which varies over time, indicates the likelihood and distribution of credit rationing in the overdraft sector. These estimated probabilities are calculated for the three classes of business borrowers (agriculture, commerce and manufacturing) and are similar to the overdraft utilisation ratios in these sectors, which are independent measure of tightness in credit markets."

 """,1981.,The Effects of Seasonal Adjustment in Econometric Models,"rdp8101, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The effects of seasonal adjustment in econometric models has received little attention in the literature, despite the fact that deseasonalised data, adjusted by various means, are widely used. This paper provides a valuable insight into the relative effects of three adjustment procedures – the X-11 method, the Durbin-Wymer DSEAS method, and the seasonal dummy variable approach. A basic problem in studying seasonality is that the true seasonal pattern is not observable. This is overcome by using an econometric model and data whose structures are completely prespecified, so that experiments can measure exactly the effects of adjustment procedures. This is the basis of the Monte Carlo method used here. The model and data chosen are such as to give the results wie applicability. The first part of the study compares the procedures of X-11 and DSEAS in terms of their ability to deseasonalise a single economic series. It shows that the errors involved in producing a seasonally adjusted series are relatively small for both methods. If the seasonal pattern changes gradually over time, then the X-11 method gives smaller errors than DSEAS. The second aspect of the study considers the effects of adjustment on parameter estimates of an econometric model. X-11 and DSEAS both adjust data prior to their inclusion in the model. On the other hand, the dummy variable approach uses constructed seasonal variables in the equations of the model to capture the effects of seasonality. The experiments show that, for the given model, the dummy variable approach is best, while there is little difference between the use of X-11 or DSEAS."

 """,1981.,Overdrafts and Credit Rationing,"rdp8101t, Reserve Bank of Australia.","A line of credit or overdraft is a common contingent lending contract that is an alternative to a fixed or fully drawn loan. The latter has received much attention in empirical and theoretical analyses while the former has received virtually none. In particular, much effort has been put into investigating credit rationing, which has been defined as occurring when a borrower wants a larger loan than is offered at the ruling interest rate. The meaning of credit rationing in a line of credit or overdraft regime is the subject of this paper. An overdraft is the right to overdraw an account, up to a specified maximum and over an agreed period after which time credit limits are reviewed. The borrower pays interest on the credit he uses, which is determined by him up to the maximum allowable. In such a system, the lender faces uncertainty from two sources. First, when the credit limit is established there is uncertainty as to how much credit will actually be used during the life of the credit arrangement. This is significant to the lender because he may have to find cash to cover unexpected fluctuations in realised usage of the credit line. Second, there is uncertainty concerning the borrower’s ability to replay the overdraft loan plus interest when the overdraft contracts terminates. This is the default risk issue that is commonly addressed in the context of fixed loans. There are in effect two distinct demands for credit in an overdraft or line of credit system. First, there is the demand for the credit limit that is available in all contingencies and which is independent of the second demand, which is the actual drawing against the credit limit. This leads quite naturally to two concepts of credit rationing with overdraft, which I shall call ex ante and ex post. Ex ante rationing occurs when a borrower would like a larger credit limit, given his expectations of the interest rate he will be charged, prior to his actual use of the credit limit. That is, the borrower can anticipate the possibility of some situations in which he might face a binding credit constraint. Ex post rationing occurs when the borrower needs more credit than his limit given the interest rate. This paper is concerned with the existence of ex ante credit rationing in a credit market in which there are no interest rate ceilings on borrowers and lenders, and the credit market is assumed to be competitive in that lenders earn zero expected profit. The result is obtained in a simple two period model in which the borrower requires credit to finance a loan project that is subject to diminishing returns (such as a perfect competitor financing production subject to increasing marginal costs) and faces default risk. A further complication is introduced by assuming that the borrower has a random source of revenue during the life of the credit agreement and this random revenue affects his need for credit from the lender. This model is an abstraction from reality that tries to capture three features of real-life line of credit arrangements: (i) such facilities are typically available to borrowers who are financing working capital and whose revenue from the sale of output may be randomly spaced during the time the credit facility exists. (ii) since the borrower’s cash flow is irregular, then to the extent that overdraft credit and retained earnings are the only source of working capital to the borrower any fluctuations in cash flow will have an impact on the demand for borrowed credit. (iii) the credit facility is never established for an indefinite period, but rather is set up subject to review after a finite period. Once established, the limit is not altered until the review date. This abstracts, of course, from any central bank directive concerning limitations on lending rights. In addition to showing the existence of ex ante credit rationing, the paper also considers the impact of an alternative asset for the borrower to invest in in addition to working capital. As expected, the existence of the asset, by increasing the opportunities to the borrower, leads to a demand for a larger credit limit. The effect of a binding ceiling on lending rate is to raise the average rate of credit utilisation and to increase the degree of credit rationing."

 """,1980.,Inflation-unemployment Trade Offs in an Open Economy: Theory and Evidence for Australia,"rdp8010, Reserve Bank of Australia.","It is now widely accepted that inflation is generated by a combination of excess demand and inflationary expectations. The main objective of this paper is to present a simple combined model of wage and price inflation that incorporates these two features in a consistent manner. The model is constructed so as to pay particular attention to open economy features. The general characteristics of the model are derived from the static neoclassical theory of firms and households. To this structure we add the following dynamic adjustment assumptions: tradeable prices adjust immediately to world tradeable prices adjusted for the exchange rate, while wages and non-tradeable prices adjust to existing and anticipated excess demands in their respective markets. This procedure leads to a pair of excess demand-expectations equations in wages and non-tradeable prices. Empirically, we measure expectations about any given variable at any point in time as an optimal extrapolative function of past observations on itself. The system, as constructed, therefore contains three levels of information about the wage-price relationship: past information; information contained in the model itself; and, any additional information contained in the contemporaneous covariance of wages and non-tradeable prices. All three levels of information are used in estimating the system by a variant of Zellner’s seemingly unrelated regressions technique. In general terms the simple model appears to fit the data quite well and the theoretical properties of the system are supported by the estimates. This framework allows at least two interpretations of the long-run Phillips curve relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. The first concerns a situation in which the exchange rate is fixed. In this case, the domestic cycle of wages and non-tradeable prices has a built-in stabiliser around the trend of world tradeable prices. Of course the world price trend may itself be destabilising in some instances. Nevertheless, taking the world price trend as given we can define a long-run trade off relative to this trend. We call this the fixed-exchange-rate trade off. Attempts to exploit this trade off to lower unemployment would involve domestic inflation of non-tradeable prices at a rate in excess of the world tradeable price trend. The second concerns a situation in which the exchange rate moves over time in such a way as to preserve purchasing power parity. We call this the fixed-relative-price trade off. It could equally be called a variable-exchange-rate trade off. The data for Australia in the 1960’s and 1970’s suggest that Australia faces a vertical long-run fixed-relative-price trade off but a negatively-sloped long-run fixed-exchange-rate trade off. Thus, if the authorities could maintain, with a fixed exchange rate, a long-run inflation rate for non-tradeables that is divergent from the world inflation rate for tradeables, then some long term gain in unemployment could be achieved at the expense of a higher rate of inflation. While this assumption would be untenable to most economists, the essence of this result is that the fixed exhange rate decreases the slope of the trade off over the time horizon relevant to policy-makers."

Given that a variety of regulations and constraints compel many financial institutions to hold certain levels of government securities, the main emphasis of the analysis is on explaining movements in discretionary holdings. Equations are estimated from quarterly data using ordinary least squares for the following financial groups: a) all non-bank private groups; b) authorised dealers in the short term money market; c) life insurance offices; d) other financial institutions; e) household and corporate sector groups; and f) major trading banks. This study takes a particular interest in the way the demand for government securities has been influenced by expectations about future interest rates. We note the difficulties previous studies have encountered in this area and introduce two new measures of interest rate expectations. For the first measure we establish that interest rate movements have been non-random over the sample period and use a Box-Jenkins model to estimate optimal extrapolative expectations from past interest rate data. The second measure assumes perfect foresight. Both measures are constructed so that the expected yield incorporates changes in the market value of securities implied by interest rate changes. The first measure, based on past interest rates does not add explanatory power to our estimates of the demand for securities. In contrast, the measure assuming perfect foresight is found to markedly improve explanations of the demand for government securities for most groups in the market. The disparate results for the two measures reinforce the widely held belief that expectations are formed efficiently, and in a manner sufficiently complex that representation by simple extrapolative mechanisms must be regarded as inadequate. Perfect foresight is unquestionably too strong an assumption, but it probably lies much closer to reality than the extrapolative model. The success of the perfect foresight assumption, while not of itself offering much information on the process of expectations formation, does provide a basis for interpreting the operation of the government securities market. In our judgement the “foresight” of investors in government securities may be significantly attributed to the way authorities will occasionally tolerate quantity adjustments in the government securities market to postpone interest rate adjustments."

 """,1980.,Inflation and Relative Prices: The Australian Experience,"rdp8007, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The stylized fact of the inflationary process is that it makes life more uncertain. If prices are increasing rapidly it is argued that there is more noise in the system so that prices convey less information. This implies that people will make wrong decisions if they do not make substantial investments in collecting additional price information. It seems likely that initially people will not catch on to what’s happening, not collect the required additional information, and consequently make wrong decisions. For example, in times of inflation a shopper at a supermarket would have to make literally thousands of pairwise price comparisons in order to have full information about the new price structure. Such a large information requirement clearly does not make life any easier for shoppers and it is likely that they would respond by learning about the new price structure not immediately, but over time. These general notions about the uncertainty effects of inflation have a great deal of intuitive appeal. But very little formal research has been devoted to understanding these issues. In this paper we analyse one aspect of the area, the distortive effects of inflation on relative prices. Using quarterly Australian data for consumer prices, we find that inflation does systematically change relative prices; i.e. some prices consistently rise by more than the overall rate of inflation and some consistently rise by less. This means that inflation (i) causes costly resource reallocations and changes in consumption patterns; and (ii) makes it more difficult to forecast prices, which raises the degree of uncertainty in the economy. To illustrate the results, in Table 1 we give the percentage of the variability of each consumer price due to (i) inflation and (ii) real changes in the economy (changes in income, tastes, technology, etc.). As can be seen, 19 per cent of the variability of the price of food is due to inflation and the remaining 81 per cent is due to real factors. The last row of the table gives the inflation and real percentages for all relative price changes. These totals are weighted averages of the corresponding individual commodity percentages. Inflation accounts for 24 per cent of the total relative price variability. Our results indicate that the distortion of relative prices is substantial and should be included in any evaluation of the cost of inflation."

 """,1980.,Models and Multipliers,"rdp8006, Reserve Bank of Australia.","Can expansionary budgetary policy boost employment? Ten years ago almost every economist would have answered “yes” to this question. Now there is an important conflict in the debate on economic policy. The conflict is between the results of theoretical and empirical multiplier analysis on the one hand and, on the other, beliefs of policy advisers about the need for tight budgetary policies which help to bear down on inflation despite uncomfortably high unemployment. This paper examines this issue with the aid of the RBA79 model of the Australian economy. The usual versions of this model (and all others in existence) have fiscal multipliers for output and employment which are positive for many years. The paper shows that it is relatively simple to adjust the assumptions of the model so that increases in real government spending produce increases in output and employment for only a couple of years. In the process, considerable inflation is generated, and this has strong adverse effects on activty in the medium term. The assumptions examined are associated with the reaction of inflation to increases in government spending and the effects of inflation and/or increases in government spending on demand and supply in the goods market. The approach consists of changing selected parameters in the model, in directions dictated by economic theory and a priori reasoning. Simulation analysis is then used to explore the implications of changing these assumptions. In short, RBA79 with changed assumptions produces results more in line with the intuitions of policy makers than the results of other models. The most interesting aspect of this is that the revised assumptions may be more appropriate for current conditions than the assumptions used in conventional multiplier analysis."

 """,1980.,"Social Security, Debt Finance, and Savings","rdp8005, Reserve Bank of Australia.","A recently revived topic of interest in the economics literature has been the effect of certain aspects of goverment behaviour on the economy. In particular, it has been argued that increases in social security pension payments and the use of debt rather than tax finance for government spending both tend to depress savings, and thereby capital formation. These assertions contradict a long-standing neutrality theorem that dates back to David Ricardo. The essence of the early argument supporting neutrality was that individuals would only change their behaviour if the government action caused them to feel richer or poorer. Social security pensions involve a transfer from the young to the old. From the individual’s point of view he receives when he is old approximately what he pays in when young. Similarly, debt involves a deferring of current taxation for future taxation. The interest on the debt, like social security, involves a transfer from one group to another and thereby no net leakage from the system. The neutrality argument rested on the assertion that a rational man would be aware of these transfer implications, realise that he and his descendants were no better or worse off, and therefore not alter his behaviour. The modern explanation of neutrality, usually attributed to Robert Barro, is more complex. To begin with, it recognises that behaviour may alter even if life-time wealth is unaltered. The dominant impact of both social security and debt is an imposed rearranging of the individual’s life-time consumption pattern. Neutrality will only occur if the individual can undo these intertemporal allocation effects through his own behaviour. In this paper we show that if the economy behaves as a composite individual, then full neutrality is possible. Social security and debt both reduce consumption during youth and increase it during retirement; the rate of transfer being determined by the rate of population growth. However, if the economy has a system of operative intergenerational transfers (gifts or bequests) it is able to neutralise the reallocation effects by reversing the transfer, at a rate determined once again by the rate of population growth. This argument is only valid when we view the economy as a composite individual. The individuals themselves will not observe this perfect substitutability between social security, debt, and bequests due to corner solutions, illusions, and distribution effects. Whether or not the aggregate economy will display neutrality is an empirical question of the relative strengths of these forces. The paper reports the results of estimating savings functions using annual and quarterly data for the 1960’s and 1970’s. On the basis of these equations we are unable to reject either of the neutrality hypotheses. The implications of these results are twofold: increases in the scale of our pension system should not be regarded as having a depressing effect on savings; and, the financing mix between taxes and debt is not important, in particular, there is no support for the argument that the public debt should be reduced by raising taxes."

 """,1980.,"Money, Inflation and Economic Growth: Conditions for Superneutrality","rdp8004, Reserve Bank of Australia.","The key question addressed by the literature on money and growth is whether or not changes in the rate of monetary expansion have real effects on the growth path of the economy. This question is usually phrased in terms of the superneutrality of money. Superneutrality is distinguished from the more commonly used term of neutrality by the former’s reference to monetary growth rates, as distinct from one-shot changes in the money stock; superneutrality is thus a dynamic concept of neutrality. Superneutrality has also appeared in the literature in the guise of the natural rate of interest. The idea of a natural rate of return on capital, determined solely by real factors and thereby invariant to monetary behaviour is an attractive concept. The proposition is usual attributed to Wicksell although its recent popularization owes much to Friedman’s influential 1968 Presidential address. The early contributions to the literature, based on descriptive analysis, unanimously rejected superneutrality. They argued that money and capital are substitutes in the eyes of portfolio holders. A change in the rate of monetary expansion chnages the rate of inflation and thus the rate of return on real money balances. In principle this should set in motion a complex interaction of income and substitution effects which would alter the equilbrium of the economy. This view was largely overthrown by Sidrauski who put forward a model based on explicit optimization in which the real economy was invariant to the rate of monetary expansion. The accepted interpretation of his model is that far-sighted individuals “see through” the veil of money, and choose a pattern of behaviour that will set the economy on an optimal real expansion path. Sidrauski’s work appeared at the same time that Friedman was expounding his views on the natural rate of interest, and between them they have dominated thinking on this topic for a decade or more. Recently, however, several economists have expressed doubts about some of Sidrauski’s assumptions. The main objective of this paper is to determine whether Sidrauski’s results depend on unrealistically restrictive assumptions, and if so, whether anything can be said about the likely direction of any real effects associated with a change in the monetary growth rate. The essence of Sidrauski’s model is utility-maximization over time by an immortal household. The household has preferences over consumption in each period and real money balances. The apparent weak links in his model are: (i) the infinite horizon of the individuals involved (ii) the assumption that all individuals are identical and have the same rate of time discount (iii) the assumption that the individuals like consumption in all periods equally except for the use of the time discount rate to weight current consumption higher than future consumption (iv) the assumption that the production process is independent of money balances held by firms and (v) the assumption that money yields a return to the individual that varies with the amount held. Using an overlapping-generations framework in which individuals live for a finite length of time, but are still linked to the future by concern for their children it is possible to replicate Sidrauski’s superneutrality result. The advantage of this approach is that, unlike Sidrauski’s original model, the overlapping generations model allows a much wider range of alternative assumptions. Indeed, it is shown that superneutrality requires all five of the assumptions listed above. Superneutrality has little to do with the long-sightedness of Sidrauski’s household. It is more accurately described as a technical accident of combining certain types of assumptions. When any one of these assumptions is abandoned, monetary growth has real effects. What are these real effects? From the assumptions listed above it should be apparent that superneutrality requires two types of restrictions on the productive process and on the behaviour of individual consumers. Real effects can be generated by relaxing either of these two sides of the model. In general the effects will be an indeterminate mixture of income and substitution effects. There are, however, two cases in which an unambiguous outcome can be predicted. The first, due to Dornbusch and Frenkel arises when we relax the production side of the model to allow money to affect production directly as an input. In this case, an increase in the monetary growth rate will decrease the real growth rate of output provided cross-effects are positive (that is, an increase in the price of one good increases the demand for all other goods) and own-effects are dominant (that is, the demand (supply) for each good responds more to movements in its own price than it does to movements in the prices of other goods). The essence of this result is that since money and capital are usually hypothesised to be complementary inputs in production, a decrease in the rate of return on money will lead to a reduction in the use of money and, through complementarity, a reduction in the use of capital. The second arises when we relax the restrictions on the consumer (e.g. assumptions (i)-(iii), and (v) above). In this case an increase in the rate of monetary growth will increase the real rate of growth of output if money is held at the margin purely for its properties as an asset. If this is the case, the financial returns on money and capital will be forced into alignment. A decrease in the rate of return on money will decrease the rate of return on capital thereby implying a higher capital-labour ratio."

 """,1980.,Debt Versus Tax Financing of Government Spending: On Barro’s Neutrality Theorem,"rdp8003, Reserve Bank of Australia.","One of the longest-standing debates in economics is whether or not substitution of debt for tax finance of government spending has any real effects on the economy. The earliest argument, usually attributed to Ricardo, is that debt will only alter individual behaviour if it is regarded as a positive contribution to net wealth. Subsequent debate revolved around the question of whether or not individuals perceive debt as wealth. In the most recent contribution to this debate, Barro showed that debt will not be regarded as net wealth in a system characterised by operative intergenerational transfers. The essence of his argument is that, provided the individual cares enough about his children to leave them a bequest, he will also calculate the tax liability that falls on them due to debt issued in his lifetime. In other words, the use of deferred taxes in the form of debt should not fool the population into believing that they are better off for having avoided current taxes. The objectives of this paper are twofold: to extend and reinterpret Barro’s result, and to re-examine the various objections to the neutrality proposition. Before summarising my findings it is appropriate at this point to stress the definition of neutrality as relating to the effects of substituting debt for tax financing of a given level of government spending. Neutrality in these terms does not imply that an increase in debt coupled with an increase in spending will have no real effects. It simply means that the effects are no different to those that would follow from a tax financed increase in spending. Using an overlapping-generations life-cycle framework this paper extends the neutrality proposition to include long-run neutrality, perpetuities as well as finite-maturity debt, and gift as well as bequest behaviour. Two insights are provided by this extension. The first is that neutrality is shown to be completely independent of the net wealth content of debt. The second is that neutrality is shown to hinge crucially on the perfect budgetary substitutability of debt and intergenerational transfers. The first result suggests that the theoretical and empirical literature on debt neutrality have focussed on the wrong issue. This assertion requires some elaboration. The traditional neutrality argument considered the economy as being adequately represented by a single individual. As viewed by this individual the issue of debt generates an asset and a liability of identical value. That is, in every period over the life of the debt the government gives with one hand exactly what it takes with the other. Apart from being a zero contribution to his net wealth, the debt leaves the individual’s budget constraint unaltered. With the exception of some minor distribution effects that could arise from having many individuals, rather than one, it was generally agreed that rationality should be sufficient to generate neutrality. This argument sounds convincing but it has a flaw. As soon as a life-cycle framework is used it becomes apparent that debt involves a particular type of redistribution effect that is sytematic and fundamental to the nature of debt as a financial asset, and therefore should not be ignored. Since debt is typically acquired in youth and sold in old age it involves intertemporal and intergenerational redistribution; that is, acceptance of the debt issue implies a change in the pattern of planned lifetime consumption from youth to old age. The rearrangement of lifetime consumption patterns associated with debt will generate a behavioural response from individuals. The essence of the neutrality question is whether or not they can restore their pre-debt consumption patterns without altering the aggregate demand for capital. At this point we come to the second result of the paper. So long as individuals observe intergenerational transfers and debt as perfect budgetary substitutes their optimal response to debt will be to substitute bequests for debt as a means of restoring their desired comsumption patterns. As the demand for bequests rises equally with the supply of debt there will be no influence on the demand for capital and neutrality will follow. Note that with recognition of the intertemporal implications of the debt the case for neutrality becomes more restrictive. In the traditional case individuals had only to recognise that they were no better or worse off with debt and therefore to keep doing what they were already doing. In the life-cycle model they must recognise that their lifetime consumption patterns are being changed, realise how to respond optimally, and actually be faced with the perfect budgetary substitutability necessary for them to neutralise the consumption effects. It is the last of these that is the weakest link in the argument. While it is true that the economy as a whole faces perfect substitutability, particular individuals do not face the same transformation rates as the economy due to corner solutions, illusions, distortions, indivisibilities and distribution effects associated with taxes and family size. Since aggregate neutrality depends on individual neutrality, the theoretical case for full neutrality is not seen as being particularly strong. Neutrality is nevertheless argued to be a plausible long-run result. The paper also contains some suggestions for empirical testing of the neutrality hypothesis."

 """,1980.,Macroeconometric Models of the Australian Economy: A Comparative Analysis,"rdp8001, Reserve Bank of Australia.","For more than a decade, macroeconometric models have been used in Australia as a tool in policy analysis and to help with the task of forecasting major economic variables. Despite this, not much work has been done to compare these models. This paper helps to fill the gap in this aspect of model evaluation. It examines the theoretical structure and dynamic adjustment mechanisms in four macroeconometric models of the Australian economy. The models examined are: two models from the Reserve Bank of Australia; the Treasury–Australian Bureau of Statistics model; and Professor J. W. Nevile’s fiscal policy model. Each model is first analysed in terms of a simple diagram which concentrates on the modelling of markets and the interactions between these markets. This diagrammatic approach helps the reader to identify the role of key theoretical mechanisms in the models. The simulation properties of the models are examined with two criteria: how well each model tracks the economy; and the dynamic adjustments within each model in response to changes in certain exogenous variables. The counterfactual simulation experiments include: 1. a sustained increase in real current government spending under three alternative regimes for monetary policy; 2. a sustained increase in real exports; 3. a sustained rise in world prices; and 4. a sustained reduction in real award wages. The responses of the models are broadly similar, when variables influencing demand are changed. However, when impulses other than conventional demand shocks are imposed, the results are very different in each model. The conclusion of the paper is that more theoretical and applied research is needed on aspects of macroeconometric model building. In particular, more work is needed on the role of: prices (including wages, interest rates and the exchange rate); financial interactions; dynamic adjustment processes; and the open economy aspects of the Australian economy. The approach of the second generation Reserve Bank model appears to be a step in this direction. In general, however, more work is needed on model validation based on a wider range of criteria than have been used in the past."

The model is general and attempts to focus both on the intertemporal nature of many household decisions and on the interdependence at any point in time of various real and financial choices. An aim of the paper is to avoid premature specification of the form of the utility function (except for intertemporal additivity). This enables the derivation of general dynamic marginal utility conditions. To derive empirically implementable estimating equations, the utility function is later approximated by a quadratic. The implied adjustment dynamics of these equations are surprisingly simple, since they collapse to a simple partial adjustment framework, even for the very general utility function specifications."
