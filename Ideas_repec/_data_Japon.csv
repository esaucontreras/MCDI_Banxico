 """,2025.,Interest Rate Sensitivity of Capital Investment in Japan: An Analysis Using Panel LP-IV,"25-E-13, Bank of Japan.","This paper examines the interest rate sensitivity of capital investment in Japan. We first summarize recent global trends using macro-level statistics from advanced economies. Using firm-level financial survey data for Japanese firms, we then demonstrate how structural changes surrounding Japanese firms, such as the increase in intangible asset investment and overseas capital investment, affect interest rate sensitivity, employing a method called Panel LP-IV (Local Projection Instrumental Variables). The analysis yields several key findings: first, the interest rate sensitivity of capital investment has shown a declining trend in recent years globally. Second, intangible asset investment has a low interest rate sensitivity; consequently, firms with a higher proportion of intangible assets in their aggregate capital investment are less sensitive to interest rate changes compared to firms with a lower proportion. Last but not least, declining growth expectations and increasing labor shortages can additionally depress interest rate sensitivity. While firms with a higher overseas investment ratio showed a lower interest rate sensitivity for tangible asset investment domestically compared to firms with a lower overseas investment ratio, this difference is not statistically significant."

 """,2025.,"Private Law Frameworks for Tokenized Assets: Implications from Legal Developments in Switzerland, Germany, France, and the United States","25-E-12, Bank of Japan.","In recent years, ""asset tokenization"" has attracted attention, with proof-of-concept experiments and actual transactions progressing worldwide. These initiatives can be understood as efforts to introduce new technologies to payment and settlement systems and extend their functionality in such a way that is only possible with digital technologies. As a prerequisite for that, legal stability concerning rights is essential. Various approaches exist among jurisdictions regarding how to determine private rights concerning the holding and transfer of tokenized assets. In this paper, we (i) extract the private law elements required for asset holding and transfer, (ii) analyze the legal developments carried out in Switzerland, Germany, France, and the United States while focusing on how these elements can be satisfied during tokenization, and (iii) provide an overview of proof-of-concept experiments and actual transactions conducted based on these developments. As a result of the analysis, a difference was confirmed between cryptoassets such as Bitcoin and tokenized assets: the former is designed to take on the characteristics of transferable assets by placing emphasis on the exclusivity of the power to dispose of tokens held by the managers of private keys rather than the principle of consensual transfer of rights, while the latter is premised on the structure that ""rights in personam"" (typically, claims) are recorded by tokens. Similarly, in Japan, considering these characteristics of tokenized assets, it would seem to be an option to proceed with further clarification of private rights through refinement of legal interpretation while considering legislative solutions that reference precedents from the above countries."

 """,2025.,Exploratory Scenario Analysis Considering the Growing Presence of Domestic and Foreign Investment Funds,"25-E-11, Bank of Japan.","Central banks around the globe have increasingly incorporated the NBFI (Non-Bank Financial Intermediary) sector into their stress testing exercises, including exploratory scenario analyses, reflecting its growing importance in recent years. This paper outlines the methodology used to develop the scenario for the exploratory analysis presented in the Financial System Report (April 2025) issued from the Bank of Japan, which explicitly examines the impact of stress amplified by investment funds on Japanese financial institutions. The scenario considers a case in which investment funds, predominantly open-end funds, liquidate their securities holdings in response to a negative shock in the global financial market and the real economy, similar to what happened during the Global Financial Crisis. The negative shock is amplified through three primary channels: (i) a further decline in asset prices, (ii) a deeper slowdown in the real economy triggered by the asset price decline, and (iii) impairments of investments and loans to overseas funds. The resulting amplifying impact on the capital adequacy ratio by the end of the simulation period (end of FY 2027) is approximately a 1 percentage point reduction for IABs (internationally active banks). The increase in credit costs, stemming from the deterioration of the real economy, broadly reduces the ratio across all banks, while the declines in asset prices and impairments of investments and loans also contribute to the decrease for IABs. Immediately following the onset of stress, the sharp decline in asset prices exacerbates the valuation gains and losses of securities. It is notable, however, given limited data and research available on the NBFI sector, including open-end funds and hedge funds and their potential ripple effects on the broader financial system, our findings should be considered exploratory. They are based on a certain set of assumptions and therefore warrant careful interpretation."

 """,2025.,Second-Round Wage-Price Effects of Raw Material Costs: An Empirical Analysis Using a DSGE Model,"25-E-10, Bank of Japan.","This paper empirically examines the second-round effect of raw material price increases using a DSGE model. Specifically, it explores how price increases driven by rising raw material costs spill over into wages, which then feed back into prices. The analysis focuses on Japan and Europe, which share similar structures in terms of raw material inputs. The results show that the first-round effect, which captures the pass-through of rising raw material costs to prices, is slower in Japan than in Europe. On the other hand, the second-round effect through wages is gradual but persistent in both Japan and Europe. Furthermore, during the period of high inflation since 2020, the first-round effect of higher raw material costs was the main driver of inflation in both Japan and Europe, while the second-round effect contributed to the persistence of inflation. The paper also suggests that the recent changes in wage rigidity in Japan may have strengthened the second-round effect."

 """,2025.,Interest Rate Pass-through by U.S. Banks: Macro Implications of Bank Competition,"25-E-9, Bank of Japan.","Do heterogeneity and competition among banks matter for the macroeconomy? To address this question, we develop a Heterogeneous Bank New Keynesian (HBANK) model that incorporates oligopolistic competition among banks in both loan and deposit markets into an otherwise canonical New Keynesian model. We calibrate model parameters for the cost structure and demand for loans and deposits using data of the 170 largest banks in the U.S. Differences in the parameter values reflect differences among banks in the size of duration risk they take, markups of loan rates, and markdowns of deposit rates. Based on simulation exercises, we show that aggregate lending becomes more responsive to monetary and productivity shocks in our HBANK model than in a Representative Bank New Keynesian model (RBANK), primarily because of heterogeneity in duration risk and the responsiveness of loan markups among banks."

 """,2025.,The Presence of Foreign Open-End Funds in Japan's Financial Markets,"25-E-8, Bank of Japan.","In recent years, the rising share of NBFIs (Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries) in the global financial system has been accompanied by an increase in the presence of foreign open-end funds in Japan's financial markets. This paper first documents the fund flows into equity, bond, and real estate open-end funds investing in Japanese financial assets, as well as their buying and selling behavior, using granular data sets. Similar to the findings by existing studies, we find there are significant outflows from foreign open-end funds investing in Japanese financial assets occurred during events such as the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during episodes of rising policy interest rates abroad. These funds sell their assets, including their Japanese assets, in response to redemption requests. Next, we estimate the sensitivity of asset prices in Japan's stock and REIT markets to asset sales by market participants to understand the impact of trading by foreign open-end funds on Japan's financial markets. The estimated sensitivity is statistically significantly positive and its magnitude is found to be close to estimates for the United States reported in the literature. These findings together imply that outflows from foreign open-end funds could affect asset prices in Japanâ€™s financial markets through asset sales during periods of stress originating abroad or when uncertainty in domestic financial markets rises."

 """,2025.,Skewed Interest Rate Expectations and Effects of Central Banks' Market Operations: Empirical Findings Using Granular Transaction Data,"25-E-7, Bank of Japan.","Using trade repository data on transaction records of Japanese yen-denominated overnight index swap, we estimate individual market participants' expectations on future interest rates and document their time-variant distribution with its higher order moments. By leveraging this novel information, we implement quantitative exercises to verify the state-dependent effects of the Bank of Japan (BoJ)'s outright purchase of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) on the JGB yields conditional on the moments of this expectation distribution. We find that the BoJ's fixed-rate purchase operation resulted in a larger reduction of the JGB yields when the expectation distribution on future interest rates was skewed more positively. This empirical result implies the usefulness of the estimated expectation distribution for central banks to conduct market operations effectively."

 """,2025.,Households' Medium- to Long-Term Inflation Expectations Formation: The Role of Past Experience and Inflation Regimes,"25-E-6, Bank of Japan.","This paper presents a quantitative analysis of how households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations are influenced by individuals' ""past inflation experience"" and ""inflation regime - inflation trend at each point in time,"" using microdata from the Bank of Japan's Opinion Survey on the General Public's Views and Behavior. The results reveal that households who have experienced averagely lower inflation rates over individuals' lifetime tend to form statistically significantly lower inflation expectations. This finding suggests that the ""lower experienced inflation rates,"" particularly among younger generations who have spent most of their lives in a deflationary environment, may have contributed to prolonged low inflation expectations in Japan. On the other hand, the analysis also indicates that the relationship between inflation expectations and past inflation experience is not always constant. During high-volatility inflation regimes (i.e., periods of significant price fluctuations), the relationship with past inflation experience weakens, while the relationship with inflation perceived at each point in time strengthens. Through this non-linear mechanism, the recent surge in actual inflation may have pushed up inflation expectations in Japan. Moreover, the recent increase in inflation has contributed to the rapid increase in experienced inflation rates among younger generations. This implies that the previous situation, where lower experienced inflation rates among these generations had exerted downward pressure on Japan's inflation expectations, is undergoing a shift. It is important to closely monitor how this increase in experienced inflation rates will influence future trends in long-term inflation expectations."

 """,2025.,Labor Cost Passthrough: Evidence from Japanese Long-term Subnational Data,"25-E-5, Bank of Japan.","In this paper, we analyze labor cost passthrough to price inflation in the pre-pandemic period in Japan, utilizing novel long-term subnational datasets. In the first part of the paper, we construct a long-term prefecture-level dataset of productivity-adjusted labor costs, service prices and local labor market tightness, utilizing relevant disaggregate prefectural data and applying prefecture-level Panel Vector Autoregression to study the interlinkages of the variables. We find statistically significant labor cost passthrough to service prices at the local level for the sample of fiscal year 1985-2018, but also find that the passthrough weakened for the sample after the mid-1990s, when Japan entered low inflation phase. In addition, by utilizing the R-JIP database, the industry-prefectural data available from the 1970s, we find that both the services and manufacturing sectors experienced a decline in labor cost passthrough to the value-added deflators after the mid-1990s. We also find statistically significant asymmetric labor cost passthrough characterized by larger upward passthrough compared to downward passthrough (often called the rockets and feathers effect) in the services sector for the period before the mid-1990s, but such asymmetric effects disappeared in the post-mid 1990s period."

 """,2025.,"Supply Shocks, Employment Gap, and Monetary Policy","25-E-4, Bank of Japan.","How should monetary policy respond to supply shocks in terms of inflation and employment stabilization? We introduce labor force entry and exit in an otherwise standard model with staggered price- and wage-setting to include employment in the model. A welfare-maximizing policy features wage growth stabilization with variation in the employment gap and inflation. Under staggered price- and wage-setting, the real wage adjustments to shocks entail a welfare cost, and variation in the employment gap contributes to reducing the welfare cost. Therefore, leaning against the employment gap induces substantial welfare losses for supply shocks compared to the welfare-maximizing policy."

We compare the forecast accuracy of various specifications of the inflation expectations function in the model, and find that specifications that take into account the mechanism of adaptive expectations, which is influenced by past actual values of inflation, provided relatively high forecast accuracy on average since 2013. However, the relative forecast accuracy between different specifications varied from phase to phase, suggesting a large uncertainty in the expectations formation mechanism itself. We also assess the future uncertainty of inflation expectations based on the model's past forecast errors. Under the assumption of adaptive expectations mechanism, inflation expectations are more likely to rise when the recent actual inflation is higher."

Specifically, we generate ""counterfactual paths"" for key financial variables, including nominal interest rates, as well as inflation expectations, in a hypothetical scenario where these policy measures are absent. Then, we conduct counterfactual analysis using Q-JEM to simulate the developments of real GDP and the CPI under those counterfactual paths, and estimate the policy effects as the differences between the actual values and the simulation results. The analysis shows that, during the period from the introduction of QQE in 2013 to the April-June quarter of 2023, the policy measures have on average pushed up the level of real GDP by around +1.3 to +1.8 percent and the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (less fresh food and energy) by around +0.5 to +0.7 percentage points."

 """,2025.,The Impact of Negative Interest Rate Policy on Interest Rate Formation and Lending,"25-E-1, Bank of Japan.","This paper examines the impact of the introduction of the negative interest rate policy (NIRP) on interest rate formation and lending in Japan through literature reviews and empirical analyses. Previous studies indicated that NIRP had the effect of lowering the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates and encouraging search for yield behavior among investors, pushing down not only short-term interest rates but also long-term interest rates. Analyzing data from Japan and the euro area, we find that NIRP had a significant downward effect on interest rates for longer maturities in addition to the short-term interest rates. Next, with regard to the impact on lending, previous studies suggested that the introduction of NIRP could create accommodative financial conditions and increase lending as with conventional monetary policy that guides short-term interest rates, while it could impede the financial intermediation function by deteriorating the profitability of financial institutions (""reversal interest rate"" mechanism). In this regard, analyzing data on Japanese financial institutions, we find no evidence that even financial institutions with a larger amount of deposits relative to total assets, whose earnings are likely to be affected by NIRP, experienced a declining trend in lending after the introduction of the policy. This result may have been influenced by factors such as the introduction of the three-tier system for current accounts at the Bank of Japan that eased the contractionary impact on financial institutions' earnings and maintained their risk-taking capacity."

We estimated the causal impact of the measure using propensity score matching to address the selection bias stemming from the voluntary basis of participation in this program. The results indicate a statistically significant difference in the outstanding loans between the participating and non-participating banks, suggesting that the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Stimulate Bank Lending helped increase lending."

 """,2024.,Japan's Unconventional Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate Dynamics,"24-E-23, Bank of Japan.","This paper empirically examines the response of the nominal exchange rate (U.S. dollar-yen exchange rate) to the monetary policy changes, focusing on the effects of various unconventional monetary policy measures implemented by the Bank of Japan over the past 25 years. Specifically, applying the estimation method proposed by Inoue and Rossi (2019), we identify Japan's ""monetary policy shocks"" from changes in the entire yield curve and the exchange rate around policy announcements, and estimate the dynamic response of the exchange rate to them. The results show that the yen depreciated against the U.S. dollar in many cases in response to Japan's expansionary monetary policy shocks, and that non-interest rate differential channel - e.g., the shifts in future exchange rate expectations - accounts for the larger parts of such responses than conventional interest rate differential channel. Moreover, our findings suggest that the responses of the exchange rate to unconventional monetary policies have been state-dependent in the sense that they could vary significantly depending on global financial market conditions and investors' herding behavior at each point in time."

 """,2024.,On the Balassa-Samuelson Effect in Japan,"24-E-22, Bank of Japan.","The real effective exchange rate (RER) is inherently a general equilibrium variable and its fluctuations are influenced by various factors. In addition to supply factors such as productivity, demand factors, home bias, risk sharing, fiscal and monetary policies also affect the RER. In this context, the ""Balassa-Samuelson effect"" (B-S effect) focuses on the role of productivity differentials in the tradable sector in explaining the long-run trend of the RER. In this paper, we quantitatively examine the extent to which the B-S effect has been observed in Japan's RER since the 1970s by constructing and estimating a two-country (Japan and the United States), two sector (tradable and non-tradable), dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. In addition, we also examine cases where the law of one price does not hold in tradables (dominant currency pricing and local currency pricing) and restrictions on labor mobility across sectors. Our results indicate that the long-run trend of the RER in Japan and the United States can be explained to a considerable extent by the B-S mechanism. In other words, according to the model analysis, the yen's appreciation trend in the RER from the 1970s to the mid-1990s can be explained by the rising relative productivity of Japan's tradable sector relative to the U.S., as pointed out in previous studies, and the effects of the Plaza Accord in 1985. In addition, the depreciation of the yen in real terms since the mid-1990s can be explained by a decline in the relative productivity of Japan's tradable sector relative to the United States; the ""reverse B-S effect"" from Japan's perspective."

 """,2024.,Effects and Side Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy: A Shadow Rate Approach,"24-E-21, Bank of Japan.","Over the past 25 years, the Bank of Japan has conducted a variety of unconventional monetary policies. This paper empirically analyzes the impact of these unconventional monetary policies on Japan's economic activity, prices, and financial sector. First, we investigate the impact of the Bank of Japan's purchase of long-term JGBs on long-term interest rates and find that it lowered the rates by lowering the term premium. Its impact was particularly pronounced following the introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) in 2013. Second, we employ a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) and the shadow rates as a proxy of a monetary policy stance reflecting information on the entire government bond yield, and investigate the counterfactual analyses. Our estimation result indicates that the series of unconventional monetary policies had a positive effect on output and prices, and the large-scale monetary easing after the introduction of QQE contributed to fostering a non-deflationary environment in Japan. The empirical analysis also indicates that the unconventional monetary policies may have had the side effect of reducing the profitability of banks by lowering lending rates."

 """,2024.,Firms' Interest Payment Burden and Productivity under a Low Interest Rate Environment,"24-E-20, Bank of Japan.","For a long period, a low interest rate environment has continued on in Japan. While this environment puts upward pressure on the real economy through a decline in real interest rates, it also hinders the business dynamics of firms and induces inefficient resource allocation. Taking this into account, in this paper, we first try to extract a group of firms that continue to survive with support from banks or other entities despite performing poorly and having no prospect of recovery. We refer to these firms as ""financially-supported firms."" We find that the share of financially-supported firms in Japan has remained at a low level in recent years. The productivity of financially-supported firms is lower than that of other firms and despite their limited number, they put downward pressure on aggregate productivity. We then analyze the spillover effects of financially-supported firms on the macroeconomy, i.e., through distortion in resource allocation. The analysis of large firms in recent years does not suggest that the presence of financially-supported firms has suppressed the productivity of other firms. Next, we conduct an empirical analysis on the relationship between a low interest rate environment and financially-supported firms. No direct relationship is confirmed between the two, partly due to the fact that the emergence of financially-supported firms was prevented under a stable financial system. However, in recent years, while the share of firms facing a significant deterioration in business conditions, such as financially-supported firms, has been at a low level after having declined from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s, the share of firms remaining at relatively low productivity has been flat; this suggests the possibility that the low interest rate environment might be one of the attributable factors."

 """,2024.,Assessing the Long-Term Impact of Monetary Policy,"24-E-19, Bank of Japan.","The ""hysteresis effect,"" in which short-term economic shocks can influence long-term economic trends, has been widely recognized. This paper presents empirical analyses of the long-term impact of monetary policy on the supply side (productivity and potential GDP, etc.) of the Japanese economy. First, we identify monetary policy shocks using various methods and examine their long-term impact on potential GDP over the past 25 years through the local projection method. The results suggest that monetary easing may have had a positive impact on potential GDP through capital accumulation, but no statistically significant relationship is confirmed. Next, we examine the impact of monetary policy on productivity, using firm-level data. The results indicate that while monetary easing could enhance productivity within individual firms, it may also act to suppress productivity growth by causing distortions in resource allocation among firms. However, in the long-term, the analysis reveals no evidence of a statistically significant relationship. Thus, from the empirical analyses using currently available data, no clear conclusions about the impact of monetary easing on the supply side of the economy have been reached, either positive or negative. There are various mechanisms at work in the long-term impact of monetary policy, and these effects may vary, depending on economic conditions. Ongoing examination from a broad perspective remains essential to deepen our understanding of the long-term impact of monetary policy."

 """,2024.,Macroeconomic Impact of Shifts in Long-term Inflation Expectations,"24-E-18, Bank of Japan.","This paper examines the impact of shifts in long-term inflation expectations on economic activity and price dynamics in Japan using a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model. Our empirical findings demonstrate that exogenous positive shocks to long-term inflation expectations improve the output gap and generate upward pressure on inflation rates. These results suggest the existence of an ""expectations channel"" in Japan, whereby higher inflation expectations stimulate private sector spending through mechanisms such as reducing real funding costs. Looking at the analysis by period, it indicates that during the deflationary phase of the 2000s, declining long-term inflation expectations likely contributed to persistent downward pressure on prices, potentially serving as one factor that hindered Japan's exit from sustained deflation. However, following the introduction of the ""price stability target"" and Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) in 2013, this contribution reversed, appearing to exert upward pressure on inflation rates. In this respect, the findings suggest that the ""management of expectations"" intended by monetary policy during this period demonstrated some effectiveness. Nevertheless, as inflation rates subsequently declined, the upward contribution of inflation expectations to the inflation rate diminished, failing to anchor expectations to the price stability target. This outcome suggests the inherent difficulty in maintaining a sustained influence on long-term inflation expectations."

Specifically, we employ macroeconomic variables (output gap and inflation rate) as observed variables, in addition to the nominal and real yield curves, and conduct an estimation combining the representative yield curve model, the Nelson-Siegel model (Nelson and Siegel, 1987), with a VAR with common trends (Del Negro et al., 2017). The results presented in this paper indicate that since the 1990s, both nominal and real natural yield curves have exhibited downward shifts, as a consequence of a decline in the natural rate of interest. Furthermore, both curves have flattened due to a trending decline in the term premium. The results also indicate that the extent of these changes differs between the nominal and real natural yield curves. However, it should be noted that the estimation of natural yield curves is still in the process of development. Consequently, the results should be interpreted with caution."

Specifically, we point out that (1) there is a great deal of uncertainty in estimating the potential growth rate due to differences in approaches; (2) a decline in the potential growth rate could be accompanied by an even sharper decline in aggregate demand, leading to a worsening of the output gap; (3) the slowdown in labor productivity growth, combined with the decline in the labor share and the deterioration in the terms of trade, has exerted downward pressure on real wages; (4) the slowdown in labor productivity growth has also led to upward pressure on prices through rising unit labor costs; and (5) the prolonged deflation and low inflation themselves might have adversely affected productivity through suppressing demand for capital investment and other factors. While the sluggishness of potential growth and the slowdown in labor productivity growth are serious problems in themselves, monitoring these trends is also necessary for conducting monetary policy with the aim of maintaining price stability. It is also important to look at the relationship between productivity, prices, and wages from a variety of perspectives, while being mindful of the uncertainties in these estimates."

The main results are summarized as follows. First, we find that, in order to maintain profitability, Japanese firms have raised their wage markdowns while their price markups have declined since the late 1990s. Both the U.S. and Japanese firms experienced rising wage markdowns, but Japanese firms differ in that they experienced declining price markups. Second, regarding determinants of price markups for Japanese firms, we find that firms' investment in intangible assets has significantly contributed to raising price markups across industries. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, a decline in Japan's share of global exports due to changes in the international competitive environment has worked as a force for exerting downward pressure on price markups. In non-manufacturing, the number of stores per capita increased which worked as a force for enhancing the severity of price competition and exerted downward pressure on price markups. Third, we find that TFP growth in Japan was mainly driven by (1) the efficiency improvements from declining price markups, and (2) contributions from technological progress was much smaller than those of the United States. We also show that Japan's technological frontier, as measured by actual output and price markups, did not expand as much as in the United States."

In the 1990s, monetary policy faced a lower bound on nominal interest rates as the economy fell into stagnation and mild deflation due to various factors both on the demand and supply sides. In the 2010s, the economy recovered thanks to the effects of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing and other measures, which brought about a situation of no longer being in deflation. However, the ""price stability target"" of 2 percent could not be achieved while people's mindset and practices based on the assumption that wages and prices were unlikely to rise remained. After the pandemic in the 2020s, as the economic recovery and the tightening of labor markets as well as the surge in import prices have strengthened the virtuous cycle between wages and prices, it came in sight that the ""price stability target"" would be achieved in a sustainable and stable manner. Against this background, signs of change have been seen in the global economic landscape, labor markets, and firms' price-setting behavior. The mindset and practices based on the assumption that wages and prices were unlikely to rise, which took root during the deflation period, appear to be dissolving."

By incorporating into the model the variables that capture global economic and financial trends, such as demand and supply of safe assets and cross-border spillovers, with a smooth-transition framework, we account for the existence of non-linear regime change of their coefficients, driven by globalization. Our findings indicate that along with the progress of globalization, (i) the impact of global factors rapidly increased around 2000, and (ii) the commonly observed decline in the natural rate of interest can be largely attributed to these global factors. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating global factors such as demand and supply of safe assets and global spillovers, with their increasing impact, alongside the domestic factors such as productivity and demographics, when investigating developments in the natural rate of interest."

We confirm all estimates of r* showed a downward trend in the long run.

 """,2024.,Pricing Implications of Centrality in an OTC Derivative Market: An Empirical Analysis Using Transaction-Level CDS Data,"24-E-11, Bank of Japan.","Using transaction-level records making up the universe of single-name credit default swap (CDS) contracts in Japan, we document whether and how the relative centrality of sellers to buyers, which proxies for their search ability and thus bargaining power, affects single-name CDS prices. Our main findings are as follows. First, our panel estimation, which comprehensively controls for the standard pricing factors considered in practice (e.g., entitiesâ€™ risk, counterparty risk, the notional amount, and maturity), suggests that CDS prices are higher the higher the relative centrality of sellers to buyers. Second, such centrality premium becomes more apparent under unfavorable market conditions and further increases when buyers attempt to unwind their short positions. Given the non-negligible quantitative impacts of relative centrality on CDS prices, we find that CDS prices to a large extent are determined by the bargaining power originating from the ability to search for counterparties. Third, deeper trade relations between sellers and buyers result in a centrality discount when market conditions are unfavorable and a centrality premium when market conditions are favorable. This result suggests that there is a tradeoff between the cost of maintaining relationship in periods of favorable market conditions and the benefit of securing cheaper access to CDSs in periods of unfavorable market conditions."

 """,2024.,The Bank of Japan's Large-Scale Government Bond Purchases and the Formation of Long-Term Interest Rates,"24-E-10, Bank of Japan.","This paper quantitatively examines the effects of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ's) purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) - especially the large-scale purchases since the introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing in 2013 - on the formation of long-term interest rates in Japan using time series analysis. The results can be summarized as follows. First, having quantified the effect of BOJ JGB purchases taking market participants' expectations about the future path of such purchases into account, we find that the effect of JGB purchases on interest rates has been driven by the increase in JGB holdings (i.e., the stock effect), which affects market participants' risk allocation, rather than by the daily conduct of JGB purchases (i.e., the flow effect), which affects supply and demand in the secondary market. Second, in addition to the flow and stock effects, the Yield Curve Control framework introduced in September 2016 had the effect of restraining interest rate increases when long-term interest rates approached the upper bound of the announced range. This effect tended to be larger when the BOJ took countermeasures and market participants expected such countermeasures. Finally, our analysis of interest rates at different maturities suggests that the framework of government bond purchases and Yield Curve Control had an effect on interest rates across a wide range of maturities, and that the recent large-scale monetary easing had the effect of pushing down the entire yield curve."

The main results can be summarized in the following three points. First, regarding the impact on transaction volume in the JGB market, JGB purchases by the BOJ (i.e. increase in flow) increase transaction volume on average, while the BOJâ€™s increased holdings of JGBs (i.e. increase in stock) and its conduct of continuous fixed-rate purchase operations decrease transaction volume. However, if the BOJ conducts JGB purchases when its share of JGB holdings exceeds a certain threshold, transaction volume will decrease. Second, regarding the impact on bid-ask spreads in the JGB market, while JGB purchases by the BOJ reduce these spreads, the increase in the share of JGBs held by the BOJ will lead to a nonlinear widening of the spreads. Third, regarding the impact on the shape of the yield curve, an increase in the BOJâ€™s holdings of certain JGB issues and its conduct of continuous fixed-rate purchase operations will lead to a downward distortion in the yield curve."

The results show that the decline in interest rates due to large-scale monetary easing put downward pressure on interest margins on loans and securities investments of banks. However, capital adequacy ratios were not necessarily pushed down significantly, because the decline in interest rates boosted the price of stocks and bonds and reduced credit risk. On the other hand, the improving real economy and lower lending interest rates increased demand from the corporate sector, leading to an increase in loans outstanding. In addition, the improvement in corporate finances due to an improved real economy, lower lending interest rates, and rising land and other asset prices, reduced credit risk in lending and contributed to an increase in loans outstanding. The results of the counterfactual simulation suggest that the decline in interest rates due to large-scale monetary easing contributed to the facilitation of financial intermediation."

In addition, the trend component of services price inflation is the best indicator to gauge the underlying trend in price inflation among indicators examined in this paper. Further, wages and prices decoupled around 1998, but they have recoupled to some extent in the post-COVID-19 era. Lastly, the volatility of the common trend component of wage and price inflation determines the strength of the linkage between wages and prices, and it closely tracks an indicator which shows importance on price inflation when firms revise wages in negotiations."

Using as an example the U.S. tariff hikes against China during 2018-19, which serves as a natural experiment, we first confirm that the stylized facts shown in previous studies--that China's exports to the U.S. decreased significantly, while bystander countries not directly involved in the tariff hikes increased their exports to the U.S.--hold true for semiconductor-related products. Then, to further examine the restructuring of global semiconductor supply chains, we calculate the upstreamness--the distance from final use--of each country's exports in the supply chain, and examine how this has evolved over time and how it can be related to wage differences between those countries. We find that export upstreamness is positively correlated with the wage gap between the trading countries and confirm that this tendency existed well before the recent tariff hikes. These observations imply that the restructuring of global semiconductor supply chains is not led solely by the direct consequences of the tariff hikes, but also by the endogenous response to changes in comparative advantage between the countries involved in the supply chain."

[2022b]. The CBMFI shows the following. First, in the midst of the Global Financial Crisis from 2008 to 2009 and the period of global monetary tightening from 2022 to 2023, the index fell sharply as the functioning of bond markets deteriorated. The empirical results on the reasons for this decline suggest that, in addition to domestic factors, the tightening of foreign financial conditions had an impact by leading to a deterioration in investors' risk sentiment. Second, while the CBMFI has remained relatively stable in the period since 2013, sub-indexes for the primary and secondary markets show somewhat different developments. This partly reflects the fact that the large-scale monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, including outright purchases of corporate bonds, improved market functioning, especially in the primary market. Third, in terms of the link to the real economy, an improvement in the functioning of the corporate bond market has a positive effect on the real economy through an increase in business fixed investment. The empirical results suggest that the functioning of the primary market is especially important, as it directly affects firms' funding conditions. The CBMFI constructed in this paper proves to be a useful indicator for assessing the functioning of corporate bond markets in a comprehensive and timely manner as one of the transmission channels of monetary policy."

Historical decompositions show that various types of global shocks, including downward cost pressure due to globalization, had continuously pushed down Japan's consumer prices until the late 2010s. Subsequently, their contribution reversed, significantly pushing up prices, especially in the high-inflation phase after the pandemic. In addition, we find that service prices and nominal wages, which had not been much affected by global shocks, have also been pushed up significantly by global shocks in the recent period."

First, compared with the United States and Europe, Japanese firms have tended to raise productivity by improving the efficiency of their production processes through use of low-cost inputs from abroad. Second, a decline in the competitiveness of Japan's trading sector is due to intensifying competition from abroad and it can be seen as a factor behind the deterioration in Japan's terms of trade and the depreciation of the yen's real effective exchange rate in the long run. Third, there has been a shift in employment from the manufacturing sector to the nonmanufacturing sector, while a wage gap between these two sectors has widened. Fourth, globalization has exerted continuous downward pressure on inflation in Japan for most of the past 25 years. Fifth, in the face of declining price markups, partly due to intensified competition from overseas, Japanese firms have been able to secure their profits by increasing wage markdowns. Given the growing debate about the risk of deglobalization and the impact of heightened geopolitical risks, it is worth deepening our understanding of the impact of these factors on Japan's economy by carefully examining how the five characteristics outlined above will change (or whether they will not)."

By applying Japan's 1958-2019 data to a multi-industry network model, we obtained the following results. First, common factors explain approximately 60% of the variation in Japan's long-term GDP growth rate. This result contrasts to that in the US: common factors explain only about 30% of the secular trend in US GDP growth. Second, however, the impact of industry-specific factors is non-negligible. In particular, machinery-industry-specific factors explain much of the low growth in the past 20 years. Finally, the spillover effects from individual industries to the aggregate GDP depend on the role of each industry in the production network, and in Japan, the influence of investment-related industries such as the machinery industries and construction is substantial."

Japan is no exception, albeit lower levels than those of other countries. This paper analyzes the direct and indirect effects of product-market and labor-market shocks on prices and nominal wages using the model proposed by Bernanke and Blanchard (2023). With minor modifications to incorporate the dual structure of the Japanese labor market, the model achieved a good fit to actual Japanese data. The main findings are as follows. First, the high inflation that Japan has experienced in the wake of the pandemic can be explained mostly by product-market specific shocks such as energy and food price spikes, but not by labor market tightness. This result is similar to the U.S. results presented in the Bernanke-Blanchard paper, which is somewhat surprising given the differences between Japan and the U.S. in labor market structure and firms' price- and wage-setting behavior. Second, Japan's low inflation relative to the U.S. during this period can be explained by a difference in the initial conditions of the underlying inflation trend before the pandemic and a difference in the degree of labor market tightness. Lastly, the model suggests that the impact on inflation of changes in labor market tightness was weaker in Japan."

Our results show that these differences are important in determining the frequency of climate-related communication as well as context in which central banks address climate-related issues. All told, these findings suggest that mandate considerations play an important role in shaping central bank communication about climate change."

Our estimates suggest that (i) the PS-NKPC performs better than the canonical New Keynesian Phillips Curve in terms of quasi-marginal likelihood-based model comparison, and (ii) pipeline price pressures have non-negligible impacts on consumer price inflation as well as producer price inflation."

In this study, we empirically examine how and whether these reforms have achieved the transparent OTC derivative market accompanied by homogeneous prices as one of its intended goals. To do so, we use data from the universe of JPY-denominated interest rate swap (IRS) contracts that were executed in the period from April 2013 to October 2021 and involved at least one Japan-based entity. First, as reported in Cenedese et al.

Second, such price heterogeneity temporarily increased but eventually diminished after the introduction of new margin rules for bilateral clearing. These results indicate that the ultimate source of price heterogeneity had been the insufficient margin provision in the bilateral clearing that the reforms effectively resolved."

Specifically, we first divide the workers into two classes with distinct wage structures, based on a finite mixture model estimated using various characteristics of the workers and the firms they work for. We find that the two classes correspond to what previous studies have called an ""internal labor market,"" where, under long-term employment practices, labor is reallocated within firms and wages follow a seniority-based system, and an ""external labor market,"" where labor moves across firms and wages are mainly determined by supply and demand in the market. We next analyze the effects of economic factors on individual full-time workers' wage growth rates. We show that, in the internal labor market, neither labor market conditions at the industry and firm-size level nor the output gap at the macro level have had an effect on the wage growth rates in recent years, while higher potential growth has had a positive effect. By contrast, in the external and the overall labor markets, improvements in labor market conditions and the output gap have accelerated the wage growth rates, even in recent years."

Using Japanese data, the paper empirically investigates whether the degree of the pass-through rises when increases in costs exceed a certain threshold. Three main empirical results are obtained. First, there is a statistically significant nonlinearity in that the pass-through to CPI inflation of increases in producer prices, exchange rates, and wages rises once the increase in each of these variables exceeds a certain threshold. Second, our nonlinear model is superior to the linear model used in previous studies in terms of in-sample model fit and out-of-sample forecasting performance, suggesting that the linear model underestimates the degree of the pass-through of an input-cost increase that exceeds the threshold while overestimating that of a smaller input-cost increase. Third, the estimated impact of the nonlinear pass-through of increases in producer prices and exchange rates on CPI inflation is often transitory, whereas that of wage growth tends to be persistent due to the observed higher inertia in wage growth. These results suggest that whether a nonlinearity will arise in the pass-through of wage growth is one of the most important issues for future developments in CPI inflation."

In addition, we measure variable importance and decompose model predictions using so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques that have been widely used in recent years. The results of our analysis are twofold. First, ML captures more accurately than ordinal logit regression the nonlinear relationships between financial indicators and credit ratings, leading to a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Second, SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) and PDP (Partial Dependence Plot) show that several financial indicators such as total revenue, total assets turnover, and ICR have a significant impact on firmsâ€™ credit quality. Nonlinear relationships between financial indicators and credit rating are also observed: a decrease in ICR below about 2 lowers firmsâ€™ credit quality sharply. Our analysis suggests that using XAI while understanding its underlying assumptions improves the low explainability of ML."

Key issues on the outlook for the pace and durability of nominal wage growth in Japan are (A) whether wages will rise more broadly, including among full-time workers with relatively low mobility, (B) whether firms' growth expectations will increase, boosting investment and leading to higher labor productivity, (C) whether labor mobility will be facilitated by skill upgrading, and (D) whether the situation in which wage increases have been suppressed under the low inflation norm will change so that prices and nominal wages will rise together."

Under nonzero trend inflation, the non-CES aggregator of goods and staggered price-setting give rise to a variable real marginal cost of goods aggregation, which becomes a driver of inflation. This marginal cost consists of an aggregate of the goods' relative prices, which depends on past inflation, thereby generating intrinsic inertia in inflation. Likewise, the non-CES aggregator of labor and staggered wage-setting lead to intrinsic inertia in wage inflation, which enhances the persistence of price inflation. With the theory we show that inflation exhibits a persistent, hump-shaped response to monetary policy shocks. We also demonstrate that lower trend inflation reduces inflation persistence and that a credible disinflation leads to a gradual decline in inflation and a fall in output."

To fill this gap, we construct a New Keynesian multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with an input-output structure of intermediate inputs and an investment network calibrated to Japan's economy. We study the impact over time of carbon tax on different sectors, on aggregate GDP, and on GHG emissions. We then consider the long-term implications through a steady-state analysis, and the short- to medium-term implications by a simulation from 2020 to 2050, under various scenarios with different tax base compositions and announcement timings. We show that the impact on the trade-off between output and GHG emissions is importantly affected by inter-sectoral interactions among firms, and by the intertemporal decisions of households and firms."

While a series of policy actions seemingly have served well to rein in bankruptcies in the short run, more than a few have remarked that the facility measures could hamper business dynamics and distort resource allocation in the medium to long run. Based on these discussions, this paper provides a literature survey of existing studies on the effects of corporate facility measures of banks and governments on resource allocation in the economy. It mainly focuses on Japan after the collapse of its bubble economy, European countries after the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crises, China under debt expansion, and developed countries during the spread of COVID-19. We also identify so-called ""zombie firms,"" which survive with banks' and governments' support despite performing poorly without the prospect of recovery, using firms' financial data. We set the criteria of the zombie firms by arranging methodologies proposed by the existing studies. The analysis shows that the number of zombie firms surged after the collapse of the bubble economy in the early 1990s in Japan. It decreased in the early 2000s and remained relatively lower in recent years for both large and small-and-medium enterprises. At least based on the currently available data in fiscal 2020 after the spread of COVID-19, we do not detect a problematic growth in the number of zombie firms as in the 1990s. Still, we need to be cautious about the development of zombie firms because we have data constraints on the recent data."

Second, the model employs machine learning techniques to improve the nowcasting accuracy by endogenously changing the mixing ratio of nowcast values based on traditional economic statistics (the Indices of Industrial Production Forecast) and nowcast values based on alternative data, depending on the economic situation.

This paper estimates the portfolio overlap - which we define as the correlation of changes in the market value of securities portfolios - between global investment funds and Japanese financial institutions in the last two decades and study the time series properties and the financial stability implications. There are three main findings. First, the number of financial institutions with a high portfolio overlap with investment funds has increased since before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The increase is particularly prominent for the portfolio overlap between bond funds and regional banks. Second, financial institutions with lower capital ratios, loan-to-deposit ratios, lending margins tend to have a higher degree of portfolio overlap with investment funds. Third, financial institutions with a higher degree of portfolio overlap with investment funds tend to see a larger decline in the market value of the securities portfolio in response to global market shocks such as redemption waves to investment funds, rises in U.S. interest rates, or disruptions in the U.S. bond market. Our results indicate that as secular changes in structural factors such as a decline in the potential growth rate of the home country weigh on the long-term profitability, Japanese financial institutions in particular regional banks have increased investment in foreign securities, making themselves susceptible to global market shocks that arise from the activities of global investment funds even without direct exposure to these funds.

Studies on the measurement of fire sale vulnerabilities in part those associated with NBFIs in a financial system are often conducted at the jurisdiction level using fire-sale (FS) models. While existing studies use granular data to analyze details of fire sale dynamics; in most of these cases, the scope of analysis is focused on a certain jurisdiction or asset class, leaving the cross-jurisdiction or cross-asset spillover dimension out of the scope. To address these points, this paper measures cross-border and cross-asset spillovers of market shocks (""interlinkage effect"") in the GFS using a standard FS model, specifically focusing on the role of NBFIs. With the help of existing FS models, we construct measures of the interlinkage effect across different types of financial institutions, including banks and various types of NBFIs, in Japan's financial system as well as those for the foreign financial system (the U.S. and Euro area) using flow of funds data of these jurisdictions. We find that the interlinkage effect has increased substantially, not only for Japan's financial system, but also for the overseas financial system since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). These increasing interlinkages of NBFIs with various types of entities suggest there has been a global structural change in the transmission of market shocks."

Specifically, we conducted a panel data regression analysis of government bond repo transactions, controlling for factors such as transaction entities and transaction types, and provided a detailed analysis of the haircut-setting mechanism. Accordingly, we determined that explanatory variables affecting credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, such as the credit quality of government bonds, the residual maturity of government bonds, and the presence of foreign exchange risk, significantly impact haircut setting. Furthermore, financial institutions closer to the center of the network, which engage in transactions with additional financial institutions, tend to set lower haircut rates through more efficient matching of borrowing and lending needs for cash and securities. Thus, the credit quality of government bonds transacted, exchange rate stability, and the presence of intermediaries important to the trading network significantly impact the degree of market functioning. The results were robust, paving the way for further discussions on trends and risk management of securities financing transactions, which are essential to financial markets."

The estimates are conducted through two approaches, the hedonic approach and local projection, for the sampled sites that are selected from the viewpoint of avoiding potential omitted variable bias. Our main findings are threefold: (a) hazard map information affects land prices in a statistically significant manner. The effect is accompanied by a lag and its size varies depending on land use. (b) In addition to hazard map information, past flooding experiences affect land prices, suggesting the importance of the role played by the subjective flood risk perception formed through past flooding experiences. Indeed, in areas where large-scale flooding has occurred frequently in the past, hazard map information is reflected in the level of land prices to a greater degree and land prices are less susceptible to changes in hazard map information. (c) The estimated impact of flood risk on land prices based on the two approaches does not deviate significantly from the alternative measure of the impact of flood risk on land prices computed using the actual flood damage. However, the differences between the estimated impact and the alternative measure may become large for a certain type of flood risk and land use. Our results suggest that, in addition to the objective flood risk contained in, for example, hazard map, subjective perceptions of flood risk, such as those reflected in past flooding experiences, may also be important in land price formation."

This paper shows that the growth rate of labor productivity in Japan has remained low since the collapse of the bubble economy in the early 1990s. We summarize the background and the issues involved in improving productivity based on previous research and additional analyses provided in this paper. We also analyze developments in labor productivity during the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) pandemic and discuss the issues involved in achieving sustainable growth in the post-COVID-19 era. Based on our literature review, the background to the recent stagnation in labor productivity can be summarized as follows. First, the pace of capital accumulation has generally slowed. Second, there are issues involved with the utilization of capital stock. While investment in research and development (R&D) has been increasing, it has not led to improvements in productivity. Third, Japan has issues with resource reallocation. By analyzing data on individual firms, we find that production resources are not being allocated efficiently as low-productivity firms remain in the market for a long time. These long-standing issues which Japan has faced became apparent once again under the pandemic. Specifically, the pace of capital accumulation is further reduced, and the efficiency of resource allocation has not improved. Meanwhile, increased utilization of IT capital, such as the expansion of working from home and online consumption, is a progress in improving productivity; however, such progress has been limited in comparison to that of other countries. To improve its labor productivity and attain sustainable economic growth in the future, it will be needed for Japan to further accelerate such progress and steadily resolve the various issues which it faces."

The price elasticity captures the strictness of YCC implemented by the central bank. We calibrate the model for Japan and find that sufficiently strict YCC requires limited additional bond purchases to keep the targeted yield within the targeted range, and attenuates the impact of short-rate changes in the yield curve. In the absence of YCC, the effect of bond demand and supply on bond yields increases once again as the influence of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates weakens."

 """,2022.,How Do Floods Affect the Economy? An Empirical Analysis using Japanese Flood Data,"22-E-6, Bank of Japan.","The impact of natural disasters caused by increasing-scale climate change on economic activity has been the focus of global attention in recent years. Natural disasters primarily damage the assets owned by firms and households and public infrastructure, i.e., direct effects, but they may also affect the economic activity through the subsequent changes in production inputs, i.e., indirect effects. While there is already a large number of empirical analysis on the indirect effects, however, no consensus has been established not only on the scale and persistence, but even on the signs. In this paper, we estimate the indirect effects of past flood disasters in Japan on the real economy using Prefectural Accounts and Flood Statistics. There are three main findings. First, while floods have a negative effect on the GDP of the prefecture in which they occur, this effect may not persist over the long run as it loses statistical significance after the year following the year of occurrence. Second, floods have different effects across sectors. Floods generally have a negative effect on GDP of the manufacturing and the wholesale and retail sectors, while they tend to have a positive effect on GDP of the construction sector. Third, the magnitude of the indirect effect of floods differs for asset, facility, and equipment that incurs damage. Compared to damage to the assets owned by firms and households, damage to public infrastructure, such as roads, and to public service utilities, such as electric power facilities, tend to depress GDP more significantly, which may indicate the importance of public assets in the spillover effects of flood damage."

 """,2022.,Transmission of Flood Damage to the Real Economy and Financial Intermediation: Simulation Analysis using a DSGE Model,"22-E-5, Bank of Japan.","This paper quantitatively assesses the indirect effect of floods on the real economy and financial intermediation in Japan by estimating a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model that incorporates a mechanism through which floods cause the capital stock and the public infrastructure to depreciate exogenously, using the data on flood damage recorded in the Flood Statistics released by the Japanese government. The result of the analysis is twofold. First, flood shocks dampen GDP from the supply side by reducing the capital stock inputs. The decline in GDP then impairs the balance sheets of firms and financial intermediaries, resulting in disruptions to financial intermediation and thus dampening GDP further from the demand side. Even when the direct damage due to floods is fully covered by insurance, the downward pressure on GDP endogenously deteriorates the balance sheets of these sectors, causing the same mechanism to operate. Second, the quantitative impacts of flood shocks on GDP up to now have been minor compared to the standard structural shocks that are considered important in existing macroeconomic studies, including shocks to total factor productivity (TFP) and the subjective discount factor. According to the estimates that use the relationship between the key variables in our model together with climate change scenarios published by an external organization, the impacts of these shocks could become somewhat larger in the future."

Our analysis shows that unit labor costs and real government spending have a significant effect on the upward risks to inflation.

We select the specification with variable elasticity of demand for Japan and that with sticky information for the US, using quasi-marginal likelihood. The selected specifications show that the persistence of inflation expectations formation is higher and trend inflation is lower in Japan than in the US. These findings account for persistently weak inflation developments in Japan: in the presence of firms' cautious price-setting behavior that reflects the purchasing attitude of consumers who are sensitive to price increases, inflation remains low and induces, through the highly persistent formation of inflation expectations, low expected future inflation and hence low trend inflation, which in turn put downward pressure on present inflation through the Phillips curve."

We further show that such inflation perceptions, as well as sentiment and awareness of the ""price stability target,"" influence households' tolerance towards price rises. We then analyze how changes in the price of individual goods and services influence perceived inflation using aggregate data and find that a large share of the fluctuations in perceived inflation can be explained by changes in food product and petroleum product prices. In addition, we show that house prices, which are not included in the CPI in Japan, also explain these fluctuations. These results imply that households have in mind a different basket of goods and services from the CPI when they form their inflation perceptions."

From the results, it was observed that some highly important financial institutions functioned as intermediaries for transactions and that continuous transaction relationships within groups were built around them. These characteristics may contribute to the efficient matching of cash borrowing and lending needs, and to the smooth execution of large-lot transactions. We also conducted some analysis of the behavior of the network structure of the JGB repo market under market stress using the data from March 2020, when the repo rate fluctuated significantly due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results of our analyses show that the PSI tends to precede consumer prices by several months and that it reflects various factors affecting price developments, including demand factors associated with the business cycle and cost factors such as changes in raw materials prices and exchange rates. Our analysis suggests that the PSI is a useful monthly indicator of inflation expectations, in that it captures the price-setting stance of firms responding to the Economy Watchers Survey.

Since the damage from most floods tends to concentrate in a confined geographical area, a precise evaluation of their financial impact requires an assessment of sufficiently granular data, which is a challenge for the existing studies. In order to address that challenge, this paper combines Flood Statistics, which records almost all flood damage that has occurred in Japan at the municipality level, with firm-level financial data, and this makes it possible for us to analyze the impact of floods on firms' financial conditions with greater accuracy and granularity in comparison with previous studies. The three main conclusions of this paper are as follows. First, flood damage has a negative impact on the ratio of profit to sales, especially in the manufacturing industry. Second, the impact of floods on this ratio lessens in the short term. And third, the negative impact tends to be greater for firms located in municipalities that experienced floods with less frequency. Financial institutions need to pay close attention to the possibility that floods may cause more deterioration in firms' financial conditions than ever before as a consequence of climate change, and thus endeavor to enhance their risk management framework, bearing in mind that risk characteristics may vary depending on lenders' characteristics."

Through the commitment, the Bank of Japan is implementing a so-called ""makeup strategy,"" which aims to offset a part of past inflation misses from the target by allowing actual inflation to overshoot the target for some time and thereby stabilizing average inflation over the business cycle. Existing studies have shown that such makeup strategies are actually effective for the U.S. economy. This paper examines the effectiveness of the makeup strategy for Japan's economy, where inflation expectations formation is known to be largely adaptive. Specifically, we build a small-scale macroeconomic model for Japan's economy and conduct simulation analysis to study the implications of adopting the makeup strategy for early achievement of the inflation target as well as the incurring social welfare costs. Simulation results show that when the inflation rate has been below the target, it is effective to stabilize average inflation by offsetting the past inflation misses over some makeup windows. In addition, the results suggest that when the natural rate of interest is lower, the optimal makeup window becomes longer."

In this respect, the current system of Japan fs PPI system is confronted with the following two challenges: (i) overall inflationary pressures in the entire economy cannot be tracked because the indexes for goods and services are separately constructed and published; and (ii) the effects of price changes in upstream stages in the production flow are exaggerated because the PPI is aggregated as the ""all commodities index"" in which prices of commodities in different demand stages are aggregated through weight-averaging by gross trade value. In order to overcome those challenges, we construct a price index of Final Demand-Intermediate Demand aggregation system of Japan fs PPI (the FD-ID price index) by assigning commodity-level Japanese PPI indexes for goods and services to the stage of final demand and the four stages of intermediate demand, in an optimal manner in accordance with the production flow in the Input-Output table and by aggregating the indexes in a way that eliminates multiple counting. The use of the FD-ID price index makes it possible to measure inflationary pressures in the entire Japanese economy, including both goods and services sectors. It also becomes possible to track the process of price changes being transmitted from upstream to downstream stages in the production flow across the sectors of goods and services.

Further, using government debt as a measure of emerging economies' structural vulnerability, we find that an increase in government debt substantially raises the risk of capital outflows in times of stress.

The literature has pointed to three factors, other than long-term inflation expectations, that act as drivers of long-term BEI rates: (i) the deflation protection option premium of inflation-linked bonds, (ii) the liquidity premium of the bonds, and (iii) the spread between nominal and real term premia (the term premium spread). This paper estimates an affine term structure model to decompose Japan fs BEI into long-term inflation expectations and these three other driving factors. Our empirical results show that the deflation protection option premium for Japan fs Inflation-Indexed Bonds (JGBi) has pushed the BEI up, while the liquidity premium of JGBi and the term premium spread have pulled it down, all having non-negligible contributions to developments in the BEI. This indicates that the evolution of Japan fs BEI has been driven by these three factors as well as by the long-term inflation expectations of market participants. Consequently, the estimated long-term inflation expectations have evolved higher than the BEI throughout almost the entire estimation period."

 """,2020.,Flattening of the Wage Phillips Curve and Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity: The Japanese Experience in the 2010s,"20-E-4, Bank of Japan.","In this paper, we examine from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective the validity of the hypothesis that downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR) induced upward rigidity in wage setting, thereby contributing to the flattening of the wage Phillips curve. We focus in particular on Japanese regular workers, those workers who are characteristically employed on long-term contracts. Our theoretical study, which incorporates long-term employment contracts, indicates that DNWR induces upward wage rigidity through the following two channels: first, due to the lack of sufficient downward wage adjustments during economic downturns, firms may become reluctant to increase wages in economic recovery phases; second, firms contain wage increases even in economic expansion phases as they take into account the risk of pay cuts in the future. The strength of the latter channel largely depends on expected economic growth and its uncertainty. As a result, the wage Phillips curve becomes flatter than would be the case without DNWR. In line with the theoretical result, our empirical study using the panel data of Japanese regular workers reveals that the slower growth of monthly earnings, which excludes bonuses but includes overtime pay, for workers who display a strong degree of DNWR pushed down the growth of monthly earnings at the aggregate level by 0.4 percentage points per year (a range of 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points, given uncertainty regarding the identification of DNWR) between 2010-17. In particular, the channel arising from future pay cut risks became relatively stronger in the late 2010s, when labor market conditions became markedly tighter."

 """,2020.,Monetary Policy and Macroeconomic Stability Revisited,"20-E-2, Bank of Japan.","A large literature has established the view that the Fed's change from a passive to an active policy response to inflation led to U.S. macroeconomic stability after the Great Inflation of the 1970s. We revisit this view by estimating a generalized New Keynesian model using a full-information Bayesian method that allows for indeterminacy of equilibrium and adopts a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. The estimated model empirically outperforms canonical New Keynesian models that confirm the literature's view. It also points to substantial uncertainty about whether the policy response to inflation was active or passive during the Great Inflation. More importantly, a more active policy response to inflation alone does not suffice for explaining the U.S. macroeconomic stability, unless it is accompanied by a change in either trend inflation or policy responses to the output gap and output growth. This extends the literature by emphasizing the importance of the changes in other aspects of monetary policy in addition to its response to inflation."

Specifically, we identify ""low-return borrowers,"" whose borrowing interest rates are low relative to their financial soundness. Using bank-firm level data for millions of Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises, we find that bank loans to low-return borrowers have increased more than those to other normal firms in recent years and such risk taking by banks has been driven by the low interest rate environment as well as the increase in competition among banks. In addition, we show that highly capitalized banks with low profitability increased loans to such vulnerable borrowers more than lowly capitalized banks. These results suggest riskiness of credit allocation has increased in Japan's loan market, but it does not seem to pose an immediate threat to financial stability."

In this sense, the manner in which firms form their inflation expectations in Japan is complex. Second, although firms' inflation expectations have been pushed up by the Bank of Japan's introduction of its ""price stability target"" and the expansion in the output gap amid the Bank's Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE), the presence of rational inattention and information stickiness has slowed the pace of the rise in firms' inflation expectations."

Our main findings are as follows. First, the results of our panel VAR analysis using semi-aggregate data show that, while firms' inflation expectations have a forward-looking aspect consistent with FIRE, they are not fully consistent with FIRE in that they tend to incorporate the changes in the actual inflation rate only gradually. Second, the forecast errors of semi-aggregate inflation expectations correlate with the past revisions of expectations, implying that FIRE does not hold for all firms. Third, the results of firm-level dynamic panel regressions show that firms' inflation expectations depend to a great extent on their past expectations, which is consistent with both the noisy information and sticky information hypotheses. The regression results also show that the short-term expectations of small firms are influenced by their perception of their own business conditions, which is consistent with the noisy information hypothesis, especially the rational inattention variant. These findings suggest that firms in Japan form their inflation expectations in a complex manner that cannot be described by a single theory."

To explain this phenomenon, we develop a dispersed information model in which consumers' search for cheaper prices affects firms' pricing behavior. The model shows that firms are reluctant to pass through cost increases because they fear a disproportionate decline in their sales. A history of low and stable inflation amplifies this effect by decreasing consumers' inflation beliefs. In this case, enhancement of the central bank's communication regarding its inflation target more firmly anchors consumers' inflation beliefs and makes the Phillips curve flatter, while enhancement of the central bank's communication about the current aggregate price level has the opposite effect."

Secondly, we find that measured inflation rates of items purchased also increase with age. However, we find that age and inflation expectations continue to have a positive correlation even after controlling for the household-level rate of inflation. Further analysis suggests that the positive correlation between age and inflation expectations is driven to a significant degree by the correlation between cohort and inflation expectations, which we interpret to represent the effect of historical inflation experience on expectations of future inflation rates."

We also examine whether the recent trend of firms extending retirement age contributes to the decrease in returns, and we find that its impact has been marginal."

We calibrate the model on the Japanese and the U.S. economies, and we solve the model employing a computation method that addresses the non-linear dynamics associated with four major factors affecting the costs and benefits of inflation: (i) nominal price rigidity; (ii) money holdings; (iii) downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR); and (iv) the zero lower bound of the nominal interest rates (ZLB). The calibrated model suggests the steady-state inflation rate that maximizes social welfare is close to two percent for both Japan and the U.S., though the main driver differs by country: the ZLB for Japan, but the DNWR for the U.S. In addition, around one percentage point absolute deviation from the close-to-two-percent rate induces only a minor change in social welfare. We also find that the lower-end of the range that is acceptable in terms of welfare losses is reduced when we introduce forward guidance in monetary policy through which private agents anticipate a prolonged zero interest rate once the ZLB binds. The estimates of the steady-state inflation rate are subject to a considerable margin of error due to parameter uncertainty in ZLB parameterization."

We approach this issue with a particular focus on advances in robots, or what are essentially autonomous machines. The contributions of the paper are twofold. First, using a country level balanced panel dataset, we provide significant evidence to show that advances in robots are one factor behind the missing link. Second, we ask a standard New-Keynesian model to rationalize this fact. The distinguishing feature is the introduction of capital which is substituted for human labor, and can therefore be interpreted as the use of robots. Due to this feature and developments in robot, firms can adjust their production by using robots, whose efficiency is getting higher, instead of employing human labor. Hence, the responsiveness of marginal costs to changes in economic activity becomes weakened, and thus, our model supports the empirical fact that advances in robots are one factor behind the missing link."

We develop a rational inattention model in which households attempt to minimize the expected loss from insufficient bargain-hunting and inefficient inter-temporal consumption allocation. The model focuses on households' allocation of attention to two variables: the cheapest price of a particular product they can find, and the inflation rate the central bank aims to achieve in the long run. The model yields the clear prediction that households with a tighter liquidity constraint will allocate more attention to finding the cheapest price of a good by visiting different stores and less attention to information on the inflation rate the central bank aims to achieve in the long run including messages sent out by the central bank. Using a unique and rich micro dataset of Japanese households, we find empirical support for the testable prediction of our model. The model provides the important policy implication that households pay more attention to messages emitted by the central bank if monetary easing successfully relieves households' liquidity constraints."

Applying our model to Japan, we identify changes in monetary/fiscal policy interaction even during the period when unconventional monetary policy has been implemented.

Japan is an interesting case in this venue since its regional banking system has confronted intensified competition and there is growing evidence that the competition has led the portfolio of Japan's regional banks to be more overlapped, an indication of increased systemic risk. In this paper, we first examine the empirical relationship between competition and systemic-risk for Japan's regional banks. We find that the bank mark-up is negatively associated with the level of systemic risk, indicating that competition undermines the system-wide financial stability in Japan. However, this result is at odds with existing studies. To this end, we perform a theoretical analysis focusing on bank's portfolio diversification. We demonstrate that Japan's regional banks tend to diversify toward alternative lending when the profitability of the core business declines. This diversification results in the build-up of systemic risk through higher common exposure, a form of indirect interconnectedness."

First, comparing two different specifications of our model - one with a CES production function and one with a Cobb-Douglas production function - using marginal data densities indicates that the former provides a better fit for both the U.S. and Japanese data. Second, our estimates suggest that the elasticity of substitution is larger than one in the United States but less than one in Japan. Third, while capital-augmenting technology shocks have contributed to the decline of the labor share in the United States, they have exerted upward pressure on the labor share in Japan. The difference in the effects of capital-augmenting technology shocks on the labor share is due to the difference in the elasticity of substitution in the United States and Japan.

Should the prediction of the standard growth theory be correct, however, economic growth led by capital accumulation is not likely to be long lasting, hence we mainly focus on firm level TFP growth. As a result, we identify four channels that would continue to promote the TFP growth of the Chinese corporate sector at an aggregate level: (i) declining proportion of low-productivity state-owned enterprises, (ii) continuous influx of highly competent new start-ups, (iii) broad catching up trend among the laggards in the firm distribution, and (iv) innovation spawning R&D activities.

This paper follows this shift in economic thought and examines if the wisdom holds in Japan by estimating a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that features imperfect substitutability of bonds with different maturities, due to market segmentation and preferred habitats, using Japan's data from the 1980s to 2017. We focus specifically on the transmission mechanism, to determine which matters most: the size of the bond purchases at each period (flow effects), or the total amount of bonds taken away from the private sectors (stock effects). We find that, (i) Japan's data accords well with market segmentation and preferred habitat theories, which implies that government bond purchases conducted by the Bank of Japan have compressed the term premium, exerting an expansionary effect on economic activity and prices; (ii) the effect of bond purchases has been most pronounced since Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing was introduced, compressing the term premium about 50 to 100 basis points as of the end of 2017; and (iii) the compression of the term premium has been mainly driven by stock effects, which underscores the importance of the amount outstanding of the Bank's government bond holdings in determining the term premium."

Furthermore, the paper examines the background of recent Japan's low labor productivity growth and analyzes issues regarding Japan's sustainable growth.Labor productivity in major advanced countries has been experiencing a slowdown in recent years. This is mainly affected by the slowdown of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). In Japan, there are two reasons behind the slowdown: first, technology and ideas accumulated by research and development (R&D) and management resources such as capital and labor are not utilized efficiently; and second, these resources are not efficiently reallocated among corporations.In order to improve Japan's productivity in the medium to long-term, it is desirable to encourage the flexible reallocation of management resources such as capital and labor by changing working process at the corporate level in accordance with changes in the socio-economic environment and the advent of new technologies, as well as by improving efficiency in the labor and capital markets."

 """,2018.,Firm Performance and Macro Forecast Accuracy,"18-E-9, Bank of Japan.","Ever since Keyenes' famous quote about animal spirits, there has been an interest in linking firms' expectations and actions. But the empirical evidence on this is scarce because of the lack of firm panel data on expectations and outcomes. In this paper, we combine a unique survey of Japanese firms' GDP forecasts with their accounting data for 27 years for over 1,000 large Japanese firms. We find four main results. First, we find that firms' GDP forecasts are positively and significantly associated with firms' input choices, such as investment and employment, and with firm's sales, even after controlling for year and firm fixed effects. These results are stronger for cyclical firms, suggesting a firm's input decision is particularly dependent on its manager's forecasts when its demand is more sensitive to the macro economy. Second, both optimistic and pessimistic forecast errors lower profitability because it is costly to have too much or too little capacity. Third, while over optimistic forecasts lower measured productivity, over pessimistic forecasts do not tend to have an impact on productivity. Finally, larger and more cyclical firms make more accurate forecasts, presumably reflecting the higher return from accurate forecasts. More productive, older, and bank owned firms also make more accurate forecasts, suggesting that forecasting ability is also linked to management ability, experience and governance. Collectively, this highlights the importance of firms' forecasting ability for micro and macro performance."

The estimated model shows that long-term inflation expectations declined to about 2 percent in the late 1980s and remained anchored to the 2 percent mark until the mid-1990s. They fell below 2 percent in the late 1990s, which resulted in a low degree of anchoring until the early 2010s. Following the introduction of the price stability target of 2 percent and the launch of Qualitative and Quantitative Monetary Easing in early 2013, inflation expectations rose until early 2015, but have not yet been anchored to the target. A further VAR analysis demonstrates that markups in domestic goods and services markets are one important reason why expectations have not been anchored at 2 percent since the late 1990s."

To this end, we construct a DSGE model that is specifically designed to address potential drivers of the natural rate that are considered important in previous studies, and estimate the model using Japan's data from 1980 to 2017. Our findings are summarized in the following three points. First, the natural rate has shown a secular decline over time, from 400 basis points in the 1980s, to 30 basis points in the last five years. The decline has been mostly attributed to changes in neutral technology. Changes in investment-specific technology, working-age population, and demand factors have also contributed to the decline, but the quantitative impacts have been small. Second, a secular decline and the quantitative importance of neutral technology are also seen when considering the expected future natural rates over a long horizon, indicating that changes in the natural rate have been perceived as persistent rather than temporal changes over the course of history. Third, in the banking crisis starting in the 1990s, financial factors stood out as an important driver that depressed the natural rate. Their contribution holds second place, after changes in neutral technology, when comparing potential drivers by the size of their contribution to variations in the natural rate. Our results suggest the need to monitor the financial intermediation function, as well as the path of neutral technology when analyzing developments in the natural rate."

In our setup, bubbles promote growth because they provide liquidity to constrained investors. Bubbles are sustained only when the financial system is under-developed. If the financial development is in an intermediate stage, recurrent bubbles can be harmful in the sense that they decrease the unconditional mean and increase the unconditional volatility of the growth rate relative to the fundamental equilibrium in the same economy. Through the lens of an estimated version of our model fitted to U.S. data, we argue that 1) there is evidence of recurrent bubbles; 2) the Great Moderation results from the collapse of the monetary bubble in the late 1970s; and 3) the burst of the housing bubble is partially responsible for the post-Great Recession dismal recovery of the U.S. economy."

An analysis of panel data of Japanese manufacturers reveals that the appreciation of Japanese Yen spontaneously decreases the sales of exporters and the employment of non-regular workers, but it moderately reduces the employment of regular workers with a time lag. Firms relying heavily on exporting tend to implement more significant adjustments of non-regular employment in response to exchange rate shocks. This finding provides support for the claim that firms are likely to adjust non-regular workers to absorb exogenous shocks and to insulate regular workers from the shocks in an uncertain business environment."

Under the premise that population aging will deepen further in coming years, some studies predict that real interest rates will continue to be depressed further to a level below zero. In the present paper, we address this issue and explore how changes in demographic structures have affected and will affect real interest rates, using an overlapping generations model calibrated to Japan's economy. We find that the demographic changes over the last 50 years reduced the real interest rate. About 270 out of the 640 basis points decline in real interest rates during this period was attributed to declining labor inputs and higher saving, which themselves stemmed from the lower fertility rate and increased life expectancy. As for the next 50 years, we find that demographic changes alone will not substantially increase or decrease the real interest rate from the current level. These changes reflect the fact that the size of demographic changes in years ahead will be minimal, but that downward pressure arising from the past demographic changes continue to bite in the years ahead. As Japan is not unique in terms of this broad picture of changes in demographic landscapes over the last 50 years and in the next 50 years, our results suggest that, sooner or later, a demography-induced decline in real interest rates may be contained in other developed countries as well."

To see if this is the case, we combine the local projection method of Jorda (2005) with shadow rates to estimate macroeconomic effects of monetary policy shocks during the implementation period of UMP, and test if effects of these shocks with the same magnitude differ across periods or states of the economy, using Japan's data from the 1980s to 2016. We find that monetary policy shocks during the implementation period of the UMP had statistically significant expansionary effects on the economy. We also find that an unexpected 100 basis point cut in shadow rates during the UMP yielded larger expansionary effects on key economic variables than it did during the conventional monetary policy (CMP), because of the following three reasons: (i) A cut in the shadow rates resulted in a larger reduction in the real interest rate, and affected a wider range of borrowing rates during the UMP; (ii) The effectiveness of monetary policy shocks was dampened when the financial system was significantly impaired, particularly during the CMP; (iii) Other things being equal, the effectiveness has been so far little affected by the level of policy rate. Our results show that UMP has been effective, but that the nature of monetary transmission is subject to change depending on financial conditions or other economic circumstances, and therefore monetary policy needs to be carefully implemented. Note also that our study only explores the effects of a one-unit shock to the monetary policy rule, and does not address the entire effects of monetary easing that are affected by the size of shocks as well."

Specifically, we provide empirical evidence for what factors caused the actual CPI inflation rate to fall short of the BOJ's original forecast made in April 2013, by using historical decomposition technique of simple VAR analysis. The empirical results show that among the deviation of the CPI inflation rate for fiscal 2015 from the original forecast of minus 1.9 percentage points -- the difference between the forecast of 1.9 percent and the actual result of 0.0 percent -- about 50 percent (minus 1.0 percentage points) can be attributed to the unexpected decline in oil prices. A little more than 10 percent (minus 0.3 percentage points) can be explained by the unexpected slump in output gap and a little more than 30 percent (minus 0.7 percentage points) by inflation-specific negative shocks. These inflation-specific negative shocks are measured as declines in the inflation rate which cannot be explained by fluctuations in the output gap, oil prices and the nominal exchange rate, and thus implies that inflation expectations did not rise as much as originally anticipated by the BOJ."

Third, we identify demand and supply shocks by matching idiosyncratic large-firm shocks in the granular residual (Gabaix, 2011) and changes in sectoral inflation rates and show that the prolonged slowdown in productivity growth in Japan and the U.S. was mostly driven by supply shocks.

In a quantitative exercise, we estimate parameters using Japanese and U.S. data and show that changes in the term premiums of both Japanese and U.S. long-term yields have sizable effects on Japanese inflation rates via the yen-U.S. dollar exchange rate. This result implies that although decreasing domestic term premiums increased Japan's inflation rates via the exchange rate channel to some extent, it is almost equally influenced by foreign factors such as a rise in U.S. term premium."

Moreover, entry costs such as financial literacy have an indispensable effect, as well as households' various constraints, including liquidity and precautionary saving motives. Next, we examine the difference in household portfolio selection between Japan and the USA to explore the reasons why Japanese households have a cautious investment stance. The results indicate that the difference is partly explained by the differences in the relationships between risks and return in the market along with concerns about the future, but financial literacy and structural factors are also important determinants. This suggests that further improvements in institutional aspects and an increase in financial knowledge, as well as an improvement in market performance and the mitigation of future concerns, are important factors in making investment environments in Japan more attractive."

The results of our analysis show that strategic stockholdings could raise the cost of equity capital. Strategic stockholdings put upward pressure on beta in CAPM theory by increasing the volatility of returns on banks' share prices, and increasing the correlation between returns on banks' share prices and returns on a market portfolio. Although it is argued that the cost of equity capital of Japanese banks is generally higher than that of U.S. banks, our estimation results suggest that if Japanese banks decreased the share of strategic stockholdings to the same level as U.S. peers, the gap between the cost of equity capital in Japan and the U.S. could reduce to a certain extent."

We construct quarterly series of income and consumption inequality measures from 1981 to 2008, and estimate their response to a monetary policy shock. We do find that monetary policy shocks do not have statistically significant impacts on inequalities across Japanese households in a stable manner. We find evidence, when considering inequality across households whose head is employed, an expansionary monetary policy shock increased income inequality through a rise in earnings inequality, in the period before the 2000s. Such procyclical responses are, however, scarcely observed when the current data is included in the sample period, or when earnings inequality across all households is considered. We also find that, transmission of income inequality to consumption inequality is minor even during the period when procyclicality of income inequality was pronounced. Using a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model with attached labor inputs, we show that labor market flexibility is the central to the dynamics of income inequality after monetary policy shocks. We also use the micro-level data of households' balance sheet and show that distributions of households' financial assets and liabilities do not play a significant role in the distributional effects of monetary policy."

The national accounting identity dictates that GDI should be equal to GDP and also Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE). However, in reality, as in the case of the United States where GDI is estimated using taxation data, this identity may not hold because of differences in data sources, timing, and estimation methods. Our estimate of GDI also deviates from GDP: it exceeds the officially published GDP significantly as it does GDE. Though we have been unable to fully explain where this discrepancy emerges and admittedly there is ample room for further improvements in our approach, the results seem to suggest that there is a certain merit to estimating GDI based on taxation data in order to shed further light on what is going on in Japan's economy."

Financial institutions can monitor the actual business conditions of borrower firms by evaluating the firm's asset value using purchase order information. A combination of traditional firm monitoring using financial statements and high-frequency monitoring using purchase order information enables financial institutions to assess the business conditions of borrower firms more precisely and efficiently.

 """,2016.,TIPS: The Trend Inflation Projection System and Estimation Results,"16-E-18, Bank of Japan.","In practice, trend inflation is often defined as a common factor extracted from observed inflation rates by removing cyclical effects from business cycles as well as other transitory distortions. Trend inflation can also be interpreted as the infinitely long-term inflation rate expected by private economic agents. If we assume that the central bank's inflation target policy is fully credible, trend inflation will converge to the target inflation rate in the long run. In the short run, however, trend inflation and the target rate can differ due to adaptive, or backward-looking, expectations and changes in the extent to which the inflation target is credible. Based on these considerations, this paper proposes a simple new methodology for projecting trend inflation, labelled the Trend Inflation Projection System (TIPS), where trend inflation is expressed as the weighted average of two components: an adaptive component, where a common trend is extracted from several core inflation measures, and a forward-looking component, namely the target inflation rate. In addition, the weights are allowed to vary over time to capture changes in the degree to which economic agents believe in the inflation target. The estimation results show that trend inflation in Japan increased dramatically in the first quarter of 2013, when the BOJ raised the target inflation rate, and has continued to rise gradually since then. However, since the second half of 2014, medium- to long-term inflation expectations have shifted downward, meaning that inflation expectations may be formed in a more adaptive manner than in the model. Furthermore, decomposition of the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) based on the estimated model indicates that although CPI inflation rose from the beginning of 2013 due to the increase in trend inflation, it has decreased again since the second half of 2014 due to transitory factors such as the decline in oil prices."

In particular, expected future oil supply shocks are more than twice as important as realized and expected aggregate demand shocks or financial factor shocks in accounting for the oil price developments. Second, focusing on a recent large drop in oil prices since 2014, the analysis reveals that expected future oil supply shocks were the dominant driver of oil price falls from January 2014 to January 2015, while expected and realized aggregate demand shocks played a major role in oil price falls from June 2015 to February 2016.

In this exercise, we consider hypothetical scenarios assuming that QQE and subsequent easing measures had not been introduced, and conduct counterfactual simulations to examine how the Japanese economy and prices would have evolved under these scenarios. In this setting, we estimate the policy effects as the difference between the actual data and the counterfactual paths. We use two different starting points for the simulation: the introduction of QQE in Q2 2013, and the quarter before the introduction of QQE, when the Bank introduced its inflation target and markets may have anticipated a major policy change. Moreover, for each of the two different starting points, we consider two different cases in terms of what is regarded as part of the monetary policy shock brought about by QQE and subsequent policy measure. Specifically, in the first case, the monetary policy shock includes only the decline in real interest rates, and changes in exchange rates and stock prices are regarded as consequences of the policy shock only to the extent that they are explained within the model. In the second case, it includes all the changes in exchange rates and stock prices (beyond those predicted by the model). The simulation results indicate that in three out of the four scenarios, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) would have stayed negative or close to zero percent without the introduction of QQE and subsequent policy measures."

In this paper, we document the emergence of the new drivers of CIP deviations taking the place of banks f creditworthiness and assess their roles. We first provide theoretical evidence to show that monetary policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and other central banks widens CIP deviations, and that regulatory reforms such as stricter leverage ratios raise the sensitivity of CIP deviations to monetary policy divergence by increasing the marginal cost of global banks f USD funding. We then empirically examine whether the data accords with our theory, and find that monetary policy divergence has recently emerged as an important driver that boosts CIP deviation. We also show that regulatory reforms have brought about dual impacts on the global financial system. By increasing the sensitivity of CIP deviations to various shocks, the stricter financial regulations have limited banks f excessive gsearch for yield h activities resulting from monetary policy divergence, and have thereby contributed to financial stability. However, the impact of severely adverse shocks in the asset management sector is amplified by the stricter financial regulations and is transmitted to the FX swap market and beyond, inducing non-U.S. banks to further cut back on their USD-denominated lending."

Our empirical results indicate that while the launch spreads on EM corporate bonds properly reflect firm-specific factors as structural credit models suggest, they are also affected by those market-wide factors that describe the primary market environment at issuance (hereafter ""time effects""). During the 2004 to 2008 and 2010 to 2015 periods, the time effects clearly lowered the launch spreads to a level well below the long-term average prior to the global financial crisis of 2008, which indicates that the primary market environment for EM USD-denominated corporate bonds was favorable by historical standards during these periods. In addition, we find that the more accommodative the Fed's monetary policy is, and the more stable U.S. financial markets are, the lower the launch spreads on EM USD-denominated corporate bonds are. This finding is in line with the view that the accommodative and stable financial conditions in the U.S. contributed to improving USD funding conditions for EM companies since 2010."

While the model has multiple equilibria with different levels of inflation (positive or zero), the equilibrium selection in line with global games implies that the economy with a high natural interest rate, i.e., high expected productivity growth, tends to move into the equilibrium with positive inflation. The policy analyses indicate that monetary policy measures such as an increase in the target inflation rate and a decrease in the lower bound of nominal interest rates can prevent the economy from moving into the zero inflation equilibrium even in the face of low expected productivity growth."

With ever greater frequency, central banks communicate to the market through the forecasts of prices and output with the purposes of reducing uncertainty; at the same time, central banks generally rely on a publicly stated medium-term inflation target to help anchor expectations. This paper aims to document how much the release of the forecasts of one major central bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), has influenced private sector expectations of inflation, and whether the degree of influence depends to any degree on the adoption of an inflation target (IT). Consistent with earlier studies, we find the central bank's forecasts to be quite influential on private sector forecasts. In the case of next year forecasts, their impact continues into the IT regime. Thus, the difficulties of aiming at an inflation target from below do not necessarily diminish the influence of the central bank's inflation forecasts."

We conduct an empirical analysis based on microdata constructed by matching a business survey for inflation expectations and corporate financial data. Our empirical results demonstrate that firms' short-term and medium- to long-term inflation expectations have significantly increased after the Bank of Japan introduced a price stability target of two percent and quantitative and qualitative monetary easing in 2013. During this period, dispersions of distributions of inflation expectations increased temporarily and then shrank again. These changes vary across business attributes, such as the size of a firm. Therefore, differences in business attributes might result in the heterogeneous reaction of inflation expectations to monetary policy shocks. Furthermore, an empirical analysis using the data from 2004 to 2016 shows that (a) both wages and short-term inflation expectations tend to increase along with medium- to long-term inflation expectations and (b) both wages and operating profits tend to decrease when only short-term inflation expectations increase. The result implies that a balanced economic growth between prices and wages can be achieved when there is an increase in a wide range of firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations."

 """,2016.,Does a Higher Frequency of Micro-level Price Changes Matter for Macro Price Stickiness?: Assessing the Impact of Temporary Price Changes,"16-E-9, Bank of Japan.","Even though prices at the macro level in Japan, like in Europe and the United States, are sticky, individual prices as measured in micro data change frequently. The reason for this puzzle, it has been argued in the context of the United States, is the presence of temporary price changes due to sales and other promotions. In other words, the impact of temporary price changes on the inflation rate is negligible, since some price cuts during sales are cancelled out by other price rebounds from the previous sale prices. The hypothesis thus is that what affects macro-level inflation is not temporary price changes but changes in regular prices, which change only infrequently and hence are responsible for sticky prices at the macro level. We investigate this hypothesis using the micro data underlying Japan's consumer price index (CPI) and find that, in general, that the hypothesis is supported in Japan's case. Unlike in the United States, however, the frequency of temporary price changes has trended upward since the 1990s, so that the impact of temporary price changes on the inflation rate has gradually increased. If this development were to continue, it could lead to greater elasticity of the inflation rate in the future."

Specifically, a combined core indicator is constructed by applying an econometric method based on dynamic model averaging as a weighted average of individual core indicators. The combined core indicator has time-varying combination weights reflecting changes in the predictive performance of each individual core indicator on a real time basis. Thus, the combined core indicator has the potential to adapt to changes in the nature and sources of price movements. Empirical evidence indicates that the combined core indicator firmly outperforms the individual core indicators over time. In addition, the combination weights for the exclusion-based indicators (e.g., the CPI excluding fresh food) tend to be high when aggregate shocks drive the overall inflation. In contrast, combination weights for the distribution-based indicators (e.g., trimmed mean) tend to be high when idiosyncratic shocks are dominant."

Based on our analysis, wage expectations increased moderately among wider range of employees after the introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE). Real wage expectations also recovered recently, although it declined soon after the introduction of QQE, reflecting larger increases in inflation expectations compared with wage expectations. Increases in inflation expectations produced the positive effect on consumer spending on the whole since the positive effect of declines in real interest rates was larger than the negative effect of declines in real wage expectations. Wage expectations were generally influenced by wage perception and business performance outlook. This suggests that improvement in wage expectations needs to associate higher expectations about business performance outlook and realization of wage increases."

Applying hedonic regressions with time dummies to large granular data sets obtained from Kakaku.com, the most popular price comparison website in Japan, we find out that sellers tend to raise product prices more than those justified by quality improvements to ensure the profitability at product turnover. A glance at the pricing patterns reveals that the prices of new products decrease gradually with the elapse of time, however, the pace of falling in prices varies considerably among commodities. The quality improvement ratio, which measures the contribution of quality growth to the price difference between matched pair of a new product and an old one by commodities, exhibits a unimodal distribution slightly fat-tailed to the right. The mode value of the distribution is about 0.5-0.6 for home electrical appliances and about 0.6-0.7 for digital consumer electronics. Those results provide an empirical support to the existing quality adjustment method in the field of the price index, so-called 50% rule, which has been implemented by some statistical agencies. Our findings bring significant implications for improving quality adjustment methods under uncertainty of quality evaluation and lead to the better understanding of the firms' price setting behavior."

Using a simple mean-variance model of bank portfolio selection subject to the value-at-risk (VaR) constraint, we make theoretical predictions on two transmission channels through which lower long-term interest rates increase loan supply: (i) the portfolio balance channel and (ii) the bank balance sheet channel. We construct a unique and massive firm-bank loan-level panel dataset for Japan spanning the period 2002-2014 and test our theoretical predictions to find the following. First, an unanticipated reduction in long-term interest rates increased bank loan supply, which lends support to the existence of the portfolio balance channel. Second, banks that enjoyed larger capital gains on their bond holdings due to a decline in interest rates significantly increased their loan supply, which lends support to the existence of the bank balance sheet channel. Further, the bank balance sheet channel was stronger in the case of loans to smaller, more leveraged, and less creditworthy firms, which suggests that a stronger balance sheet leads banks to increase their loan supply to credit-constrained and riskier firms."

The analysis reveals three key findings. First, information rigidities are determinants of cross-sectional disagreement among not only households but also experts. Second, survey data indicate dissonance regarding the long-run forecasts of inflation rates between the central bank and economic entities, despite the adoption of a 2% inflation target in January 2013 and the introduction of an unconventional monetary policy (QQE) in April 2013. While short- and mid-term inflation forecasts by households are generally close to the 2% target rate, long-term forecasts fail to converge to the target level. Finally, under the two types of disagreements, the private sector's perception about a monetary policy stance does not significantly differ before and after the introduction of the inflation target and QQE. These findings suggest that the policy regime of the monetary policy dose not abruptly change on basis of perception; that is, there is no upheaval in the agents f perception about a monetary policy stance enough to induce a regime change."

This is because, in contrast to short-term interest rates, macroprudential instruments are regarded as particularly precise tools that act only on the area of concern. In this paper, we conduct an empirical examination to determine if this is the case by studying relevant areas of the Japanese economy from the 1970s to 1990s. We focus on a policy instrument called Quantitative Restriction (QR) implemented by the government. QR explicitly required banks to curb their lending to the real estate industry and related activities, and was used in the wake of the credit boom. We construct shocks to QR using narrative records of the government, and estimate their impact on the macroeconomy. We find that QR affected the aggregate economy as well as the real estate sector and land prices. In order to see why QR was a ""blunt"" instrument, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis using individual bank data and disaggregated industry group data. We find evidence that shocks to QR affected the aggregate economy by damaging the balance sheets of banks and non-financial firms.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

In addition to labor productivity, labor input, and inflation rates, our analysis shows that the fiscal balance, national burden ratio, and current account balance (= domestic savings) influence nominal long-term interest rates. The elasticity of nominal long-term interest rates to the fiscal balance vary, depending on the levels of government debt outstanding, which are thought to affect perceptions of fiscal sustainability in the future. This implies that the elasticity of nominal long-term interest rates to the fiscal balance is non-linear depending on the levels of government debt outstanding. We also find that a low national burden ratio nurtures future expectations of fiscal consolidation and thus keeps long-term interest rates at low levels. In addition, non-traditional monetary policy measures in recent years are found to keep nominal long-term interest rates at low levels."

This paper calculates these disequilibrium factors included in the dollar, euro, and yen, and shows empirically the developments of the currency premiums from the mid-2000s. The result indicates that the euro was growing to become a world currency next to the US dollar toward the late 2000s, and then the yen was preferred as a safe haven while the US and European capital markets were under stresses."

The analysis indicates that long-term expectations are immune to actual price developments, while short-term expectations are easily affected by actual inflation. The paper also investigates to what extent household inflation expectations have been influenced by the Bank of Japan's policy stance. The analysis shows that the price stability target and the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, introduced by the Bank in 2013, contributed to strengthening the anchor of inflation expectations. Nonetheless, the anchor still needs to be improved so that household expectations are invulnerable to any disturbances in actual inflation rates."

A multivariate GARCH model with dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) is then fitted to the return data of these sample portfolios independently. The estimation results show that the correlation matrices change over time in a way that depends on the sample portfolios; further, the DCC parameters are significantly different between them. Then, the time series of the maximum eigenvalues of the correlation matrices are calculated to observe the changes in correlation intensity. A higher level of correlation intensity is observed during crisis periods, namely after both the Lehman shock and the Great East Japan Earthquake. We also examine the impact of correlation changes on the risk of sample portfolios by using a numerical simulation, with the results showing non-negligible positive impacts.

Previous studies using data from European countries have presented a number of common findings, including that banks with a high proportion of relationship lending tend to set lower pass-through. In this respect, we have obtained similar results using a dataset for Japan going back to the early 2000s. We further examine the influence of borrowing firms' balance sheet characteristics on loan interest rate pass-through, and find that these factors are also important determinants for pass-through dispersion. However, we also find that after the recent global financial crisis, even banks with a high proportion of relationship lending have largely lowered loan interest rates by raising pass-through, and that pass-through has not necessarily been determined in accordance with borrowing firms' balance sheet characteristics. These results differ from those of recent studies on European countries. Possible background factors explaining this change are that (i) pressure to lower loan interest rates has risen due to extensive monetary easing and greater lending competition among banks, while Japan's banking system as a whole has maintained its resilience in the post-crisis period; (ii) demand for bank loans has increased substantially due to disruptions in the market for alternative funding sources, such as commercial paper and corporate bonds; and (iii) public measures to increase bank loans have been broadly introduced in Japan."

The natural yield curve extends the idea of the natural rate of interest defined at a single maturity to one defined for all maturities. If the actual real yield curve matches the natural yield curve, the output gap will converge to zero. An empirical analysis using data for Japan shows that past monetary easing programs expanded the gap between the actual real yield curve and the natural yield curve mainly for short and medium maturities and led to accommodative financial conditions. By contrast, the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policy has expanded the gap for long maturities as well as short and medium maturities. The natural yield curve is expected to provide a useful benchmark in the conduct of both conventional monetary policy and unconventional monetary policy aiming to influence the entire yield curve."

We take a two-pronged approach. First, we estimate the exchange rate pass-through into domestic prices using time-varying parameter estimation. Second, we decompose the estimated exchange rate pass-through into the responsiveness of marginal costs to the exchange rate and the responsiveness of inflation to marginal costs. The estimation results show that the rates of exchange rate pass-through into the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index have been increasing since the late 2000s. Evidence from international input-output tables suggests that the import-intensity of Japan's manufacturing sector has increased considerably over the last decade. We find that although the increasing dependence on imports in production (as well as in the retail sector) accounts for part of the rise in exchange rate pass-through, a larger part of the rise is due to greater responsiveness of inflation to marginal costs. This finding hints at a structural change in firms' pricing behavior since the late 2000s."

Recognizing these challenges, this paper formulates a set of new liquidity indicators using transaction data of the markets related to Japanese government bonds (JGBs), including futures, cash, and special collateral (SC) repo, thereby examining market liquidity from various angles. Traditional liquidity indicators of the JGB futures market such as the bid-ask spread and the daily price range to transaction volume ratio suggest that liquidity in the JGB market has not declined significantly, even after the expansion of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in October 2014. However, the indicators newly formulated in this paper -- the volume of limit orders at the best-ask price, the impact of a unit volume of transactions on the market price in the JGB futures market, the divergence in quotes offered by dealers in the JGB cash market, and the lending fee of JGBs in the SC repo market -- all suggest that liquidity in the JGB market has been declining since fall 2014. While this may be a temporary phenomenon following the rapid decline in the long-term yield observed after the expansion of QQE as well as the short- and medium-term yields turning negative, it may also reflect other factors such as the massive purchases of JGBs by the Bank of Japan, structural changes in the markets, and regulatory changes. These findings underscore the need to monitor liquidity in the JGB market continuously and from many sides, using various indicators. In addition, it is important to enhance dialogue with market participants, thereby carefully monitoring the market's view on liquidity, which does not show up in the aforementioned indicators."

Based on the estimated structural parameters, we show that a decline in capital-skill complementarity in the non-manufacturing sector can provide a consistent explanation for the following aspects of the Japanese data at both the aggregate and industry levels: (i) a decline in the skill premium, (ii) widening of the sectoral wage gap due to a rise in manufacturing wages and decline in non-manufacturing wages, and (iii) an increase in the unskilled labor share in the non-manufacturing sector.

Also, more workers switch to industries with which their previous industry had larger transactions, although it affects earnings changes only marginally.

When participants in bond markets lose confidence in their outlook for future interest rates, their investment decision depends heavily on the developments of market prices. This often leads to herding behavior among traders and destabilizes market prices: demand fuels further demand, or supply fuels further supply. This study develops a theoretical model and employs it for stochastic simulations to show that volatility of bond prices and trading volumes is affected by a number of factors, such as investors' confidence in the financial environment, the usefulness or value of information available in the market, and the market liquidity of bonds. In addition, the model is fitted to actual data to specify the driving forces underlying the changes in long-term interest rate volatility observed in 2013. The analysis shows that the key to understanding the developments in long-term interest rates during this period lies in how traders interpreted information flows in the market, especially the announcement by the Bank of Japan regarding its policy change, and in capturing the extent to which their confidence was weakened or strengthened by those information flows. The findings of the analysis highlight the importance of formulating a communication strategy as part of the conduct of monetary policy and the challenges in implementing such a strategy."

This paper demonstrates that the more rapid increase in the number of college graduates in Japan than in the US explains about one-third of these contrasting trends. A simulation indicates that if the supply in the US had followed that in Japan, the return to college would have increased by 0.15 point instead of the actual 0.23 point.

In this paper, using a firm-level dataset of Japanese listed companies covering the period 2000-2011, we show that FDI by service sector firms has had positive effects on their domestic employment growth. These results are obtained controlling for spurious correlation arising from reverse causality such as the fact that firms that are successful in the domestic market are more likely to invest abroad. The positive effects are clearest in the retail, construction, and personal and business services industries. This is probably because FDI by firms in these industries does not substitute for their domestic business activities but requires that they strengthen administrative and other support functions in their domestic headquarters. A positive employment effect of outward FDI is also observed in the wholesale and transportation industries. This result may reflect the effect that firms' strengthening of their international networks helps to attract stronger demand. In contrast, in the information and communications technology industry, FDI appears to be associated with a reduction in domestic employment, possibly because IT workers at overseas affiliates substitute for domestic ones. Overall, our results suggest that for the service sector as a whole, outward FDI has been beneficial for Japan's economy from the viewpoint of domestic job creation."

We use intangible assets such as firms' technological capability and the qualifications of senior management, for which numerical data from each firm are available. The results are as follows: (1) intangible assets have statistical explanatory power for firms' default rates in addition to financial data; (2) a model that incorporates intangible assets has greater accuracy in estimating default rates than one that incorporates only financial data, and the difference in the accuracy is statistically significant; and (3) the impact of changes in intangible assets on firms' default rates is comparable with that of changes in financial data. Based on our analysis, it may be effective to take into consideration intangible assets to enhance the accuracy in estimating firms' default rates. Therefore, in assessing firms' credit risk, it is important to enhance the information on intangible assets to objectively assess these assets."

The daily log returns of the Nikkei-225 stock index are modeled by a truncated stable distribution. The VaR and ES values of the fitted distribution are regarded as benchmarks. The fitted distribution is also used as a sampling distribution; sample returns with different sizes are generated for the simulations of the VaR and ES calculations. Two parametric methods: normal distribution and generalized Pareto distribution and two non-parametric methods: historical simulation and kernel smoothing are selected as the targets of this analysis. A comparison of the simulated VaR, ES, and the ES/VaR ratio with the benchmarks at multiple confidence levels reveals that the normal distribution approximation has a significant downward bias, especially in the ES calculation. The estimates by the other three methods are much closer to the benchmarks on average, although some of them become unstable with smaller sample sizes and/or at higher confidence levels. Specifically, ES tends to be more biased and unstable than VaR at higher confidence levels."

We study empirically how the spillover effects of such shocks have changed as a result of the recent deepening of global integration. We consider shocks to the Federal Funds rate and examine how domestic production in a number of advanced, Latin American, and Asian countries were affected by these shocks during the 1990s and 2000s. We show that contractionary U.S. monetary policy shocks reduced domestic production in most of the sampled countries during the 1990s. During the 2000s, by contrast, the adverse effects were moderated. To explore the reasons behind the weakened spillover effects, we construct a DSGE model and examine the theoretical implications of the recent changes in economic structure, including global integration. In addition, we estimate response of trade and financial variables as well as policy instruments to U.S. monetary policy shocks. Our model combined with the empirical exercises suggests that, despite being enhanced by deepened trade integration, spillover effects may be decreasing due to a decline in the relative importance of the U.S. economy, and to regime switches in domestic monetary and exchange rate policy in non-U.S. countries. Though we empirically find a sign of short-run financial contagion during the 2000s, its effect upon the real economy was minor, possibly reflecting its low persistence."

The results of the Kahn test indicate the existence of strong downward rigidity in households' price expectations. One consequence of this downward rigidity is that survey answers strongly react to shocks to inflation expectations in a high inflation environment, but only weakly in a low inflation environment. Furthermore, this downward rigidity may hide potential links between inflation expectations and other economic indicators and may produce spurious correlations between them. To overcome these problems, this paper adjusts the distribution of survey answers on inflation expectations for downward rigidity. Using this adjusted distribution, the paper examines the relationships between households' inflation expectations and their views on various economic issues. The main results are as follows. From the end of 2005 onward, a negative correlation between households' inflation expectations and their outlook for economic conditions can be observed. Regarding the activities of the Bank of Japan, the following relationships can be observed from 2006. First, the more strongly households are interested in the Bank's activities, the more stable are their inflation expectations. And second, the more confidence households have in the Bank, the more tightly are their inflation expectations anchored."

The approach relies on a static factor model comprising a number of indicators that have a simultaneous relationship with GDP.

Under the PPP hypothesis, inflation expectations in one country are equal to inflation expectations in another country plus the expected depreciation rate of the nominal exchange rate. Exploiting this formula, we calculate Japanese inflation expectations from the break-even inflation rates (BEI) and FX forward spreads for five countries (United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and Sweden). The resulting PPP-based measure of inflation expectations follows a trend that largely coincides with long-run developments in the Japanese BEI. However, we find that both levels of and variations in the new measure differ across the reference countries, and that a recent gap between the new measure and the Japanese BEI is not negligible from a short-run perspective. Consequently, there remain several issues that need to be addressed to assess the usefulness of this new formula."

To examine the background to this, we apply the structural factor analysis developed by Foerster, Sarte, and Watson (2011) and decompose variations in Japan's IP into aggregate and sectoral shocks taking input-output relationships between sectors into account. We find that aggregate shocks explain most of the fluctuations in Japan's IP and are highly correlated with variations in overseas economic growth, especially since the early 2000s. However, we find a large increase in the relative importance of sectoral shocks when focusing on the more recent increase in the volatility of IP. Specifically, our analysis suggests that the intersectoral spillovers brought about by the disruptions of supply chain network in the wake of Great East Japan Earthquake and the declines of domestic production (or production capacity) in some sectors as a result of a deterioration in global competitiveness or the shift to overseas production have contributed to the recent fluctuations of Japan's IP."

The Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan (Tankan) enjoys a high response rate thanks to the cooperation of the enterprises it covers. Nevertheless, each survey inevitably includes items with missing values. When there are incidences of missing values in quantitative data items, such as sales and fixed investment, the current practice is to compile the survey result by imputing the missing value with the ""previous fiscal year's value obtained from the non-responding enterprise."" This imputation method is thought to be appropriate when the economic environment is stable, as the change in the values between the previous term and the current term is relatively small. On the other hand, during a phase of sharp changes in the economic environment, the result of the compilation may diverge somewhat from the real perception of business conditions, as the previous term's value, which does not appropriately reflect the change during the period, is used without modification. Given the fact that in recent years, there has been a dramatic economic change, such as the one brought about by the Lehman shock, it is worth examining if there are imputation methods which produce a higher degree of accuracy. Against this backdrop, this paper has compared the degrees of statistical accuracy of the current method of missing value imputation of the Tankan and its alternative methods, conducting simulations based on the data for the period from 2004 to 2010. As a result, it was found that for all of the major survey items (i.e., fixed investment, sales and current profits), ""there are alternative methods whose degree of accuracy is higher than or about the same as the imputation method now in use."""

We empirically analyze Japan's monetary policy to illustrate the proposed approach for modeling regime-switching between conventional and unconventional monetary policy periods, and find that the proposed model is preferred over a nested standard time-varying parameter VAR model.

We also show that in the present circumstances, the stockholding ratios of most financial institutions in Japan are higher than the levels calculated from the model. It is suggested that when the market is exposed to severe stress such as a surge in stock price volatility or reversal of the correlation between the interest rate and stock prices, the stockholding ratios would be even more excessive than the levels obtained from the model."

The results indicate that the global-common factor explains 36.4 percent of volatilities in overall cross-border banking flow, suggesting that the international propagations of shocks through global banks are quantitatively important.

Generally speaking, yields on financial instruments can be decomposed into elements such as risk-free rate, (credit and/or market) risk premium, and liquidity premium. The reference rate is not exceptional. In developing a model, given that in times of crisis, liquidity dried up in interbank markets where reference rates are calculated, we use a search-based asset pricing model by Duffie, Garleanu, Pedersen (2005, 2007) to consider a situation in which market transactions are sporadic. In evaluating asset prices, we also combine this model with the robust control method, a technique for incorporating model uncertainty (e.g., a situation in which market participants lose confidence in their own pricing models and market prices during crises). The results suggest a jump in the liquidity premium to the level exceeding the risk premium based on the fundamentals, while being amplified by uncertainty. Given that reference rates are broadly used in deciding lending rates for a number of financial contracts and the prices of derivatives, it may be economically inefficient to use interest rates that include premiums which have risen due to a temporary surge in uncertainty. Thus, an expert judgment could be allowed to some extent in order to remove these premiums."

We show that a noise-free reference rate based on a sufficient number of sample transactions can help to make the market interest rate less volatile, whereas the stabilizing effects of the reference rate are significantly reduced if the reported interest rates contain some noisy components. Nevertheless, by increasing the number of sample transactions reflected in the reference rate, the adverse effects of the noise can be mitigated (or eliminated) provided the noise is idiosyncratic to individual transactions. However, if the noise is common to multiple transactions, then the adverse effects of the noisy reference rate cannot be reduced simply by increasing the number of sample transactions.

In this study we explore the macroeconomic impact of population aging using a full-fledged overlapping generations model. Our model replicates well the time paths of Japan's macroeconomic variables from the 1980s to the 2000s and yields future paths for these variables over a long horizon. We find that Japan's population aging as a whole adversely affects GNP growth by dampening factor inputs. It also negatively impacts on GNP per capita, especially in the future, mainly due to the decline in the fraction of the population of working-age. For these findings, fertility rate decline plays a dominant role as it reduces both labor force and saver populations. The effects of increased longevity are expansionary, but relatively minor. Our simulations predict that the adverse effects will expand during the next few decades. In addition to closed economy simulations, we examine the consequences of population aging in a small open economy setting. In this case a decline in the domestic capital return encourages investment in foreign capital, mitigating the adverse effects of population aging on GNP."

We confirm that in addition to inflation expectations and the labor productivity growth rate, which influences the natural rate of interest, fiscal conditions, foreign borrowing, and demographics significantly influence long-term yields. The following are our main findings. First, for fiscal conditions, stock variables have greater explanatory power than a flow variable (primary balance). For stock variables, net government debt has greater explanatory power than gross government debt. Second, for foreign borrowing, net foreign debt, a stock variable, has greater explanatory power than current account balance, a flow variable. When an increase in government debt is financed entirely by borrowing from external sources, the increase in the forward rate is approximately twice that when financed domestically. Third, aging contributes to lowering yields. This appears to reflect elderly people's strong demand for financial assets, particularly for safety assets. Using the parameter values estimated by the panel data analysis, we decompose the forward rates of Japan and the US into the contributions of each independent variable. In Japan, while the increase in government debt has exerted upward pressure on yields, the outlook for rapid aging resulting from the retirement of baby boomers and the increase in net foreign assets have contributed to lowering yields. In the US, since 2000, aging resulting from the retirement of baby boomers has been reflected in bond prices, which has exerted downward pressure on yields."

In this paper, we investigate the causes and consequences of such changes in banks' behavior by introducing banks' asset portfolio decision into an otherwise standard New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. In our model, banks construct their portfolios under the value at risk constraint, which requires banks to repay their debt regardless of the return on their assets or whether the maximum loss on their assets materialized. As a result, the maximum loss on assets and banks' net worth affect banks' balance sheet and asset portfolio allocation by changing their risk taking capacity. For instance, an increase in downside risks or a deterioration in banks' net worth reduces their risk taking capacity, and results in a contraction of their balance sheets as well as rebalancing of their portfolios toward government bonds, thus dampening output and inflation. We estimate the model by Bayesian estimation and find that such portfolio decisions played an important role in the accumulation of government bonds and deflation in Japan since the latter half of the 1990s."

However, there is a positive correlation between employment protection and replacement rates implying that the net effect of the systematic difference in these institutional variables could be ambiguous. I then show that modern macroeconomic models with search and matching frictions are broadly consistent with the stylized fact: the models predict that higher firing costs and/or lower replacement rates raise the wage volatility relative to that of unemployment. I find that this result is robust to alternative setups of non-labor markets. Finally, I find that the effect of the above institutions on inflation is minor."

 """,2002.,Forbearance Lending: A Case for Japanese Firms,"Research and Statistics D, Bank of Japan.","After the collapse of the asset price bubble, Japanese banks are said to have been reluctant to write off bad loans, even in cases where there is little prospect of borrower firms being able to repay the loans extended. This phenomenon is known as forbearance lending. We illustrate this using a simple model in which a bank is shown to have an incentive to engage in forbearance lending to a borrower firm whose debt-asset ratio exceeds a certain threshold as its liquidation value (or net worth) is eroded. Then, using corporate panel data, we test for non-linearity between loans and debt-asset ratios: i.e. whether loans were apt to increase to a firm whose debt-asset ratio was above a certain level. It is found that, after the bubble burst, this non linearity became evident for non-manufacturing firms, especially those in the construction and real estate industries. Furthermore, an increase in loans to highly indebted firms in these industries is found to lower their profitability. These findings are consistent with the view that forbearance lending certainly took place in Japan, and that it suppressed the profitability of inefficient non-manufacturing firms."

To address this question, we develop a Heterogeneous Bank New Keynesian (HBANK) model that incorporates oligopolistic competition among banks in both loan and deposit markets into an otherwise canonical New Keynesian model. We calibrate model parameters for the cost structure and demand for loans and deposits using data of the 170 largest banks in the U.S. Differences in the parameter values reflect differences among banks in the size of duration risk they take, markups of loan rates, and markdowns of deposit rates. Based on simulation exercises, we show that aggregate lending becomes more responsive to monetary and productivity shocks in our HBANK model than in a Representative Bank New Keynesian model (RBANK), primarily because of heterogeneity in duration risk and the responsiveness of loan markups among banks."

Asymmetries are sizable when measured by the coefficient of skewness, a measure that is highly affected by outliers. In contrast, robustly measured asymmetries to outliers often disagree in sign or size, implying that much of the asymmetries measured by the coefficient of skewness can be attributed to extreme observations. Asymmetries in many government bonds returns are only statistically significant according to tests based on the coefficient of skewness. On the contrary, only tests based on robust measures indicate statistically significant asymmetries in the exchanges rates of Japanese Yen, a major funding currency for carry trades, as well as in New Zealand Dollar and Australian Dollar, major investing currencies for carry trades. This observation suggests that sources of asymmetry in carry trades and in government bond returns can be fundamentally different."

The other is the IMF's multi-region ""GIMF (Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal)"" model (Kumhof et al., 2010) calibrated to data for Japan and other countries. The government consumption multiplier calculated from the former model is larger than that from the latter, mainly because the negative effects of the resulting increase in the interest rate are larger in the latter model. In both models, however, the effect of a positive government consumption shock on real GDP becomes substantially smaller when the government targets a fiscal surplus by raising tax rates. The effectiveness of endogenous adjustment of the tax policy in response to non-fiscal shocks is not so much different between the two models and is not much affected by changes in the interest rate."

This paper constructs an abstract model about emergent liquidity lending by using global game techniques.

With this setup, it is shown that: (1) creditors' aggregate behavior operates as a signal to the policy maker about borrower's solvency, (2) the policy maker's optimal strategy is to help only illiquid but solvent borrowers, (3) whenever the liquidity lending facility is utilized, optimal lending rates are strictly positive, and (4) the optimal lending rates are ""conditionally punitive"" in the sense that they take the highest level possible under the restriction that the rates enable solvent but illiquid borrowers to survive."

The anticipated monetary policy disturbances are identified by estimating a medium-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with the term structure of interest rates, using the U.S. data that includes bond yields. The estimation results show that the Fed made its future policy actions unanticipated for market participants until the mid-1990s, but thereafter, the Fed tended to coordinate market expectations about future policy actions. This finding suggests that the changes in the Fed's communication strategy are consistent with the rise of the academic views on central banking as management of expectations. The inclusion of bond yields in the data for estimation is indispensable to the finding because the yields contain crucial information on the expected future path of the federal funds rate. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the presence of bond yields data generates a substantial contribution of monetary policy disturbances to business cycles."

This model is estimated by Bayesian methods with data including the relative price of investment and credit growth. We show that, in both Japan and the U.S., the main driving force of output fluctuations is neutral technology shocks, and financial shocks are at least as important for investment fluctuations as technology shocks. We also show that a sharp decline and a subsequent hike in the external finance premium, caused by shocks to this premium, induced the boom and bust cycles of investment via the financial accelerator mechanism during the late 1980s and the 1990s in Japan and since 2004 in the U.S."

In the""Money view"" based on the quantity theory of money, it can be interpreted that Japan's low inflation results from the low growth of money. However, the time-series correlation between money growth and inflation rate in advanced countries including Japan has declined since the mid 1990s. Furthermore, during this period, a strong positive correlation between the potential growth rate and the long-term inflation expectation is observed in Japan, and these facts are not consistent with the Money view. Japan's potential growth rate declined sharply in the past two decades in contrast to other advanced countries, and as a result expectations for future economic growth also declined, which may possibly have caused deflation in Japan. In the""Expected Burden view"" based on the fiscal theory of the price level, growth expectations affect the price level as follows: 1) the decline in growth expectations increases the future fiscal burden on the private sector; 2) the private sector then cuts its expenditures to increase savings for the future burdens; 3) as a result, the aggregate demand decreases and hence the aggregate price level falls. This paper examines whether such a mechanism has indeed worked in Japan or not, comparing the inflation developments in the US and the euro area."

The framework employs a hypothetical DSGE model in which the nominal interest rate can be lowered below zero because, for instance, the central bank can impose a 'carry tax' on currency. We call the model's nominal interest rate the 'shadow rate.' When the shadow rate is positive, it is observed as the actual nominal interest rate set by the central bank. When it is negative, however, it deviates from the actual nominal interest rate which remains at its lower-bound of zero. In the model, it is not the actual nominal interest rate but the shadow rate that affects the economy when the two rates deviate. The hypothetical DSGE model can be fit to data using a version of particle filters, and the historical movements of the shadow rate can be estimated. As an application, we estimate a small New Keynesian model using Japanese data. The results suggest that the shadow rate was well below zero during the period when the nominal interest rate was zero in the early 2000s."

The paper shows that Japanese banks are likely to offer high interest rates to CC investors, reflecting the economic and balance-sheet conditions of individual banks in Japan. The paper suggests that in order to draw much advantage from CC, regulators should avoid placing excess restrictions on the design of CC. By doing so, regulators can encourage banks to look for the ways to lower the interest rate of CC, some of which are illustrated in the paper. A minimum set of regulations, however, must be imposed on the design and issuing conditions of CC; otherwise, CC may disrupt the functioning of financial markets. In addition, the likelihood of bank failure is not necessarily reduced by replacing subordinated bonds with CC. Furthermore, the optimal combination of CC and subordinated bonds is extremely sensitive to economic conditions, such as the expected growth rate. All these issues are relevant when considering whether or not to allow banks to issue CC."

Under the current population estimate method, if one of the data which greatly diverges from the rest of the data (the so-called ""outlier"") does not represent the population, the estimates could also greatly diverge from the real value for the population. Since the real picture of the population when the outlier occurred is unknown, it is difficult to choose the optimum method through empirical analyses. Considering 1) the accuracy of Tankan, 2) the maintenance of its ""easy to understand"" quality, and 3) the reduction of its work load, we assume that outliers in Tankan are those which have extremely large impact on the rate of change from the previous year or the rate of revision from the previous survey of the estimated values for the population. The method of detecting and treating outliers is suitable for the characteristics of Tankan through empirical analyses of actual Tankan data. Specifically, detection method is based on the adjusted ""range edit"" method, which uses 1 percentile and 99 percentile, so that it can be applied to non-parametric data, for which the incidence of ""0"" (zero) is very high.

We find that the past absolute revisions to the annual growth rate of labor productivity often went beyond 1 percentage point. Second, the annual growth rate of labor productivity has been revised upward by 0.4 percentage points on average. We show that part of its upward revisions reflects an underestimation of employment through an increase in 'non-response people,' people who do not respond in the Population Census. Third, revisions to source data such as the Population Census and the Employment Status Survey are helpful to predict revisions to labor productivity growth. Our regression results suggest that labor productivity is likely to be revised upward during expansions or with low real-time estimates of value added. We conclude that the three findings indicate that labor productivity during the 2000s will experience substantial revisions in the future. This conclusion takes into account the fact that the SNA after 2000 has experienced at most one comprehensive revision. The upcoming revisions to labor productivity can be positive rather than negative."

First, we attempt to reorganize the variety of policy proposals for enhancing financial sector regulation. In light of the broad perspective of the prudential policy framework, we discuss the role of bank capital in enhancing banking-sector resilience. Second, with our perspective in mind, we lay out an early warning system (EWS) to predict a financial crisis where the role of capital and liquidity are explicitly captured. In the EWS, the estimation results confirm two-fold evidence: (i) capital and liquidity are imperfect substitutes for each other against the probability of crisis. And, on top of the liquidity on the asset side of the banks' balance sheet, (ii) liability-side liquidity has a statistically significant predictive power for a potential financial crisis a few years ahead. Then, we apply the EWS as a component of a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to gauge the benefit from raising capital and liquidity requirements, as more stringent regulations are expected to reduce the probability of financial crisis. On the other hand, financial-sector regulations should come along with certain costs. To quantify the cost, we employ some existing macroeconomic models to estimate the cost of raising capital and liquidity requirements. Combining the EWS (for benefit calculation) with the macroeconomic models (for cost calculation), we provide a full-fledged CBA framework that can determine the optimal levels of capital that strike the right balance between the costs and benefits of the financial-sector regulation. The main results indicate that the optimal level of bank capital would considerably vary depending on the level of liquidity indicators both on the asset and liability sides of banks' balance sheets as well as macroeconomic conditions, typically represented by housing market inflation. Finally, the CBA framework suggests that banks could stand in a better shape with a counter-cyclical capital buffer to be well-prepared for a prospective distress."

We also demonstrate that investment fluctuations are mainly driven by shocks to investment adjustment costs. Such shocks represent variations of costs involved in changing investment spending, such as financial intermediation costs. We then find that the estimated investment adjustment cost shocks correlate strongly with the diffusion index of firms' financial position in the Tankan (Short-term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan). We thus argue that the large decline in investment growth in the early 1990s is due to an increase in investment adjustment costs stemming from firms' tight financial constraint after the collapse of Japan's asset price bubble."

Using this concept in the microeconomic framework, we can describe the behavior of banks as an optimal choice of a gearing ratio and an asset quality index. We derive theoretical implications from this model and compare them with the data on the G10 and Asian commercial banks.

Using aggregated data, VAR suggests that the increased exports to China had a strong positive impact on Japanese manufacturing production but had an insignificant impact on small firms and non-manufacturing production during the last decade. It also shows that the increased imports from China had no significant impact on Japanese production. However, using firm-level data, we find that various connections with China improved the performance of small and medium size manufacturing firms and those in wholesale and retail industries. At the micro level, imports from China improved growth of sales in manufacturing firms and both profits and growth of sales in wholesale and retail firms in the early 2000s. Exports to China, which had no significant impact in the early 2000s, came to improve both profits and growth of sales of Japanese firms after the mid 2000s.

We found little evidence that producers switched to energy-saving technical change by the end of 2008 in response to the recent surge in energy prices. As a result, rising energy prices under the energy-using technical change have contributed to a slowdown in TFP growth. Meanwhile, the labor-saving technical change has made large positive contributions to TFP growth and labor productivity growth. In our models of individual industries, the biases of technical change for energy have been small since the 1980s and those for materials have been substantially materials-saving in many industries."

 """,2009.,Financial Constraints and Firms' Pricing Decisions,"09-E-4, Bank of Japan.","This paper empirically examines the impact of financial constraints on Japanese firms' pricing behavior. In spite of a large swing in demand in the bubble era and the lost decade, aggregate prices did not fluctuate much in these periods. Such price rigidity can be explained by customer market theory, which suggests that firms invest in the customer stock, i.e., market share, by charging low prices in booms, while they do not cut their prices for locked-in customers in recessions. This theory implies that the pricing decision is an investment problem, and opens the possibility for financial factors to affect the pricing decision. The estimation results show that financial positions affect the pricing behavior of large firms, but not that of small firms. The impact of financial positions on large firms' prices is counter-cyclical, and this characteristic is clearly observed in the industries that produce differentiated goods such as advanced machines. In contrast, small firms whose product brand is not well established in the market cannot lock in customers, and hence financial constraints do not affect their pricing decisions."

We find that the domestic production inducement coefficients of China's material and machinery industries have declined while the import coefficients of these industries have risen. This indicates that China has strengthened its position as ""the factory of the world"", in which it imports parts and materials, processes or assembles them, and then ships the final products. It also indicates that China's resource-securing activities have increasingly intensified because of the increasing demand for resources and energy associated with its high economic growth. We then calculate the degree of China's income dependence on foreign demand, which shows a dramatic rise, especially after 2002, shortly after China joined the WTO and embarked on liberalizing a wide range of markets including those of both goods and services. Lastly, it is shown that the labor input inducement coefficient for the agriculture sector is by far the largest and that the rates of labor input inducement differ significantly by industry depending on whether they are labor intensive or not. Labor input inducement coefficients have also been on the decline in most of the industries reflecting the improvement of labor productivity. Behind this trend is the migration of rural workers to urban areas and increased capital equipment especially in the manufacturing sector."

This paper describes a framework for macro stress-testing on credit risk currently used at the Bank of Japan (BOJ). That framework takes account of changes in borrowers' creditworthiness over the business cycle, thereby enabling us to examine the robustness of loan portfolios for major banks and regional banks against a severe economic downturn. The simulation results, taken from the September 2008 issue of the BOJ's Financial System Report, show that the framework successfully replicates the asymmetric responses of credit risk between deep recession and subsequent economic recovery by using the combination of borrowers' transition between rating classes and different sensitivity of transition probabilities to economic fluctuations across rating classes."

When inflation target is observable and credible to the public, markets provide the bank with information about the aggregate state of the economy, and hence the bank can stabilize inflation. However, when inflation target is unobservable or less credible, the public updates their perceived inflation target and the information revealed from markets to the bank becomes less perfect. The degree of uncertainty facing the bank crucially depends on how two-way communication works."

We consider labor market search and examine the role of the extensive margin for inflation dynamics by estimating three models with distinct labor adjustments. Our Bayesian estimation result shows that the model with only the extensive margin is superior to that with only the intensive one in terms of marginal likelihood. This suggests that the extensive margin may be more important for inflation dynamics in Japan. We also show that introducing the intensive margin into the extensive margin model further improves marginal likelihood. Moreover, we find that real marginal costs in these models with the extensive margin are highly correlated with the Bank of Japan's estimates of the output gap."

This paper examines the relationship between IT and productivity gains by employing the ""augmented"" growth accounting framework for Japanese industry-level data from 1975 through 2005. In particular, we estimate ""purified"" technology change at industry level by accounting for cyclical mismeasurement of inputs. We find that the post-2000 increase in overall TFP growth does indeed appear to arise from an increase in technological change. Furthermore, the pickup in technology growth has occurred not only in the production of IT but also in the industries that use IT intensively. Our results suggest the possibility that stories of IT as a general purpose technology (GPT) could apply to Japan as well as to the United States."

(2002) argued that deflation could have been avoided in Japan if the BOJ had lowered short-term interest rates by a further 250 basis points at any time between 1991 and early-1995 as ""insurance against deflation."" That study raised interesting questions on how the central bank could offer ""insurance against deflation"" when the inflation rate is close to zero. However, the simulation by Ahearne et al. (2002) has some drawbacks: it assumes the central bank's commitment to permanent downward shift of the policy reaction function when policymakers are not sure what would happen, which is neither feasible nor credible. In this paper, we show alternative policy frameworks of ""insurance against deflation"" that can be feasible and credible even under uncertainty. The simulation using the Japanese Economic Model (JEM), a large-scale macroeconomic model of the Research and Statistics Department of the Bank of Japan, suggests that what is important is not large cuts in interest rates at an early stage; rather, the central bank would commit to cut interest rates aggressively in the future, if the risk of deflation increases."

Notwithstanding this progress, the liquidity of Asian foreign exchange markets continues to be undermined by foreign exchange controls. For Asian currencies other than HKD and SGD, non-residents account for a relatively small share of activity and FX swap markets are still in their infancy. Offshore non-deliverable markets have developed in response to controls, causing trading activity to fragment. Furthermore, Herstatt risk remains high in Asian foreign exchange markets. Almost all transactions between Asian currencies are executed via the US dollar so, for those trades not cleared through CLS Bank, each leg is settled at significantly different times."

 """,2008.,Endogenous Nominal Rigidities and Monetary Policy,"08-E-4, Bank of Japan.","Recent empirical literature suggests that the degree of nominal rigidities varies over monetary policy regimes. This implies that monetary policy analysis with exogenously given nominal rigidities is subject to the Lucas critique. In a Calvo-style sticky price model, we endogenize nominal rigidities and examine their implications for monetary policy. While some previous studies stress that the frequency of price adjustment changes with a central bank's inflation target, we focus on how this frequency varies in response to changes in policy coefficients of the Taylor rule with a fixed inflation target. We find that a central bank's more aggressive policy response to inflation makes firms less likely to reset their prices. The resulting New Keynesian Phillips curve contains a flatter slope and a smaller variance of disturbances, as observed during the Volcker-Greenspan era. We also find that a central bank's aggressive policy response to inflation can stabilize both inflation and the output gap by exploiting the feedback effects of the bank's policy response on firms' price setting. This supports the good policy hypothesis about the Great Moderation. Finally, we show that changes in the policy coefficients dramatically affect the inflation weight of the social welfare loss function, since this weight increases nonlinearly with the frequency of no price adjustment. To reduce social welfare loss, it is crucial for central banks to take into account that the inflation weight changes endogenously with their policy stances."

Using a pair of unique firm-level datasets, we come to two major conclusions. (1) The selection mechanism in the Japanese credit market is efficiency-improving in that lower quality firms with higher borrowing costs are more likely to default. (2) The massive credit guarantee program implemented by the Japanese government in the late 1990s did result in the increased availability of funds to SMEs, and to the greater profitability of creditworthy firms. Moreover, interest rates do not decrease among program users indicating that government interest payment subsidies are not attributed fully to borrowers."

Thus, interdependencies between Asia-Pacific economies in terms of global production networks deepened further from 2000 onwards through increases in trade in intermediate products. In particular, China plays a more important role than ever as the main production center in the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, the degrees of income dependence between these countries are examined.

These features of production at different frequencies cannot be explained by changes in the sales process and cost-shock process. Instead, improved business practices----such as the adoption of the just-in-time technique----played a direct role in stabilizing the business cycles, while increasing output volatility at high frequencies."

The network now has higher connectivity, a shorter average path length, a higher average degree, and a higher clustering coefficient than in the past. In particular, we observe that such tendency has never been hampered by any disturbances or crises in international financial markets (such as the East Asia currency crisis in 1997 or the LTCM near-default event in 1998). We see both costs and benefits from these developments in the cross-border bank exposures. On the one hand, systemic risk in international financial markets is likely to increase because of the more direct and more widely spreading spillover effects of a crisis in one country once it occurs. On the other hand, efficiency of international financial markets is expected to further improve in terms of capital and risk allocation."

We are also interested in the estimation of the macroeconomic structure based not only on macroeconomic data but also on market interest rate information.

 """,2007.,"Credit Rating Gaps in Japan: Differences between Solicited and Unsolicited Ratings, and ""Rating Splits""","07-E-11, Bank of Japan.","Credit ratings have become an indispensable part of the fundamental information infrastructure of credit markets. Credit ratings cover a wide range of issuers including governments, governmental organizations, municipalities, nonfinancial companies and financial institutions, and also cover securitized products. For users, credit ratings are readily available tools to grasp the credit quality of securities (or issuers), as they rank, in the simple form of letter symbols, the ability of issuers to repay creditors in a timely manner in accordance with contractual obligations. It is necessary to fully understand the credit rating criteria, policies, and characteristics of rating agencies when users refer to credit ratings in making investment decisions or for other purposes. This paper attempts to clarify the current status and facts behind the two types of ""rating gaps,"" which must be taken note of by users of credit ratings. These are (1) differences between solicited and unsolicited ratings, and (2) differences in ratings assigned to the same securities or issuers by different rating agencies, i.e., the ""rating splits."" We focus on the credit ratings of Japanese corporations; i.e., B6nonfinancial companies and nonbank financial companies, excluding banks and other types of financial institutions. While these differences have often been qualitatively discussed, this paper places emphasis on quantitative and objective analyses. In the analyses, although we use data of specific rating agencies, our focus is purely on the ""differences,"" and we do not intend to rank the appropriateness of individual credit ratings. With regard to differences between solicited and unsolicited ratings, our results show that unsolicited ratings tend to be lower than solicited ratings, concurring with general views, and that such differences have been narrowing and are on average less than one notch recently. We calculate the differences, based on several assumptions, using credit ratings assigned by Standard and Poor's Ratings Services and Rating and Investment Information, as they disclose the distinctions of solicited and unsolicited ratings. The backdrop of such rating gaps may include disparity in the level of information available to rating agencies as well as cherry picking actions by the issuers. Some point out that solicited-unsolicited gaps are narrowing due to improvements in corporate disclosure among other factors, and the results of our analyses are consistent with such view. In addition, looking at the practices of credit rating usages by investors, they do not seem to distinguish solicited and unsolicited ratings in many cases. However, strong and deep-rooted concerns over the reliability of unsolicited ratings remain especially among issuers. In this respect, the issue of differences between solicited and unsolicited ratings deserves further analyses from various perspectives. In regard to rating splits, the findings are that on average a three-notch difference exists for a certain issuer between the highest rating assigned by one rating agency and the lowest rating by another rating agency. The existence of rating splits may indicate that the same credit rating symbols may signify dissimilar credit qualities by each rating agency, in other words rating scales may differ. In many cases, investors, in using credit ratings, seem to make necessary adjustments considering rating splits. We believe comparison against default rates is the ultimate test of rating splits, and assessments using data currently available suggest that differences stay within a certain range. Further analyses are also required in this respect, however, because data constraints, such as available amount of data for default rates and lengths of the sample period, are still large in Japan."

Reflecting this change, the fee business expansion did not increase the variability of their ROA in recent years. Moreover, it contributed to an enhancement in their management stability through increasing net profits. These findings suggest that if changes in the Japanese financial environment or other factors restore the positive correlation between the two types of incomes, the variability of Japanese commercial banks' ROA will increase. Whether this will lead to decreasing their management stability depends on to what degree they can enhance ROA due to increases in fee business income, and on how they use the increased income in the context of capital adequacy management. It is of note whether Japanese commercial banks' expanding the fee business contributes to securing the stability of their management without excessively increasing the variability of their profitability."

In many cases, we find the cointegrating relationships between the weighted-average land price indicators and the discounted present value of land calculated based on the macro economic fundamentals indicators. We also find that the demographic factor has impacts on real land prices. The error-correction analysis using the cointegrating relationships shows that not only the changes in the discounted present value of land, but also the changes in the demographic factor and bank lending have an influence on the fluctuations of real land prices. Based on the analysis, the recent change in the trend of land prices in Japan is explained by the increase in the discounted present values of land in the accommodative monetary environment, the convergence of the actual land prices to the long-term equilibrium level, and the changes in bank lending."

A strong emphasis is put on measuring the degree of spatial correlation of land prices, the phenomenon whereby one area's land prices are correlated with another area's land prices just because the two areas are adjacent to each other. To explore this issue, we compile regional data on land prices in the 47 prefectures in Japan and in the 23 wards in Tokyo. Japanese land prices are shown to display a high degree of spatial correlation not only at the ward level, but also at the prefecture level. We also investigate the plausibility of the claim that price formation in the Japanese land market has become more dependent on economic fundamentals since the asset bubble burst in the early 1990s. We show that although this claim may hold in commercial areas in Tokyo, there is no robust evidence that it holds for the rest of Japan."

We focus on protracted economic stagnation after the bursting of the asset price bubble, and the subsequent recovery in economic activity and restoration of financial system stability. We use the intersectoral differences in relative factor prices as an indicator for the real distortion, and use the gap between the actual and benchmark loan portfolios, based on the mean-variance approach to maximize risk adjusted returns from loan portfolios, as an indicator for financial distortion. We show that both distortions sharply deteriorated in the late 1990s and improved in the 2000s. In addition, we conduct panel data analyses using data at individual bank level as well as at industry level to examine the interaction between the two distortions: the interaction was negative in the late 1990s, but reversed to positive in the 2000s."

We use a model that belongs to the class of so-called structural models for corporate bond pricing originally developed by Merton (1974) and extended by Longstaff and Schwartz (1995) among others. Our empirical results indicate that credit spreads in Japan are negatively correlated with the risk-free interest rate and with corporate financial conditions (which stand proxy for the market valuations of firms). The magnitude of such correlations increases as the credit ratings of the bond issuers decline. These results are consistent with the implications of structural models and with the related literatures in the U.S. and Europe. We also find that credit spreads in Japan are positively correlated with the implied volatility of interest rates. In other words, an increase in uncertainty about future interest-rate contributes to the widening in credit spreads."

Then, we show that the Ramsey-optimal inflation rate of the CPI is positive while that of the PPI is negative. In addition, the efficient allocation cannot be achieved under the productivity gap.

Most academic literature on this topic concurs that the optimal currency area conditions seem to be met by subsets of Asian countries although the ultimate success of an Asian currency union hinges crucially on such factors as the historical and political backgrounds, robustness of institutional set-ups, degree of regional convergence in developmental stages, and track record of sound macroeconomic policy in constituent countries. It is also a valid concern whether the transition toward a currency union could be susceptible to speculative currency assault. The experience with the ECU suggests that a successful Asian currency unit requires preconditions including the firm political commitment, market-wide expectations of the eventual currency unification, and existence of well-functioning financial markets as well as cross-border payment/settlement systems. We can learn further from the fact that the ECU was handicapped by a lack of cash currency, which led to its limited use in commercial transactions, and inadequacies of settlement arrangements. The ECU as a divergence indicator was also rarely focused on, despite the fact that the exchange intervention thresholds were defined in relation to the ECU."

Neglecting the idiosyncratic risks in the latter subportfolio, an approximation of value-at-risk for the entire portfolio is obtained in a short time. The new method is tested using sample portfolios of nongranular 5,000 exposures. The technique provides accurate credit value-at-risk with a computation time about one-fifteenth of ordinary Monte Carlo simulation. In addition to the improved computational efficiency, the method can also be used to specify the range of a subportfolio where idiosyncratic risks do not contribute to the value-at-risk of the entire portfolio. This may serve as important information when senior credit managers review the appropriateness and efficiency of internal risk management systems from the viewpoint of obligor's risk contribution."

The basic motivation is to explore whether the substitution hypothesis still holds even under serious financial turbulence. Our main results suggest that the substitution hypothesis held in Japan when the banking sector was healthy, but broke down during the banking crisis. More precisely, both bank loans and trade credit contracted simultaneously during the crisis. Deteriorated bank health might have been primarily responsible for the widespread declines of credit to small and medium size firms in Japan during the banking crisis."

Our method boasts three distinctive features. The first is the use of intermediate variables that describe aspects of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. We use these to create a monetary policy proxy, which is able to approximate the policy stance of the monetary authority for a whole range of different policy measures. Second, we identify monetary policy shocks by imposing sign restrictions on the impulse response functions of the monetary policy proxy and nominal exchange rate to monetary policy shocks. Thirdly, we use the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate the date of any structural change in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. We show empirically that the effects of monetary policy on prices and output weakened in the 1990s. The decline in the impact of Japanese monetary policy is partly attributable to the non-negativity constraint on nominal short-term interest rates as well as to stagnant financial intermediation due to non-performing loans in the banking sector. Our analysis, however, identifies two further obstacles to monetary policy that were still more significant. First, households and entrepreneurs suffering from balance-sheet problems-the other side of the non-performing loan problem-were hesitant about aggressively expanding consumption and investment even amid ultra-loose monetary conditions. Second, the propagation mechanism in the private sector, through which economic activity prompts further economic activity, failed to function properly."

First, expenditures that should be recorded under other components in the balance of payments statistics are being increased. Second, a small amount of expenditures are not covered. Third, although the review of BPM5 under discussion requires Japan's current data collecting method to be changed, Japan will not be able to cope with the revision that may emerge from this review.

A popular method is to identify technology shocks by the long-run restriction that those solely have permanent effects on labor productivity in the system consisting of labor productivity growth and hours worked. While it has an advantage of not using Solow residuals which tend to accompany measurement errors, it potentially misidentifies nontechnology shocks, which permanently affect capital-labor ratio such as a capital tax shock, as technology shocks. We show that such shock brings nonstationarity of nominal investment-output ratio and identify it through the additional restriction that it permanently affects real investment-output ratio. Data indicate that the shock works importantly in not U.S. but Japan. In the system for Japan with the shock added, hours worked responses to technology shocks become insignificant. Furthermore the technology shock loses the dominant role in Japan's lost decade. We also study an appropriate treatment of lower-frequency movements in Japan's hours worked due to inter-sectoral labor movements and working hours reductions."

The survey confirms a clear effect whereby the commitment to maintain the QEP fostered the expectations that the zero interest rate would continue into the future, thereby lowering the yield curve centering on the short- to medium-term range. There were also phases in which an increase in the current account balances (CABs) held by financial institutions at the BOJ bolstered this expectation. While the results were mixed as to whether expansion of the monetary base and altering the composition of the BOJ's balance sheet led to portfolio rebalancing, generally this effect, if any, was smaller than that stemming from the commitment. When viewing the QEP's impact on Japan's economy through various transmission channels, many of the analyses suggest that the QEP created an accommodative environment in terms of corporate financing. In particular, the QEP contained financial institutions' funding costs from the market and staved off financial institutions' funding uncertainties. The QEP's effect on raising aggregate demand and prices was often limited, due largely to the then progressing corporate balance sheet adjustment, as well as the zero bound constraint on interest rates."

Owing to the effects of monetary easing and the recovery of the global economy, disinflationary pressures had diminished in the end of 2003 and the SNB started to unwind its expansionary policy in the latter half of 2004. This paper investigates the monetary policy conduct of the SNB during this period and the accompanying financial market reactions, to derive implications for monetary policy conduct. Our main conclusions are twofold. First, estimation of the monetary policy reaction function suggests that the aggressive easing of the SNB from 2001 to 2003 was in line with optimal reaction in the presence of a zero bound on the nominal interest rate. Second, the policy actions taken by the SNB in the easing phase did affect the expectation of market participants on future economic development and monetary policy conducts, while those in the unwinding process of 2004 did not. This fact is consistent with the view that the SNB had taken enough time to have market participants sufficiently expect the near future interest rate hike prior to the actual unwinding process. Such prudent policy conduct was compatible with the robust control in monetary policy, because the SNB judged that the outcome of the low-probability risk of a return to disinflation would be the more serious concern than the possible adverse consequence of a rise in inflation."

Nevertheless, over the same period, inflation persistence has been observed from the year-on-year percent changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). How can we interpret this micro and macro information consistently? Motivated by this question, this paper applies a Generalized Dynamic Factor Model to individual CPI item data to examine if it is possible to identify any representative price revision patterns, and if so, to investigate their basic features. Our findings indicate that in Japan there is a highly representative common component among the item data which means there is the high degree of consistency in the timing of price revisions that is a distinctive feature of Japan, in comparison with the U.S. and the euro area. Also, the common component has the feature of a long period of time between shocks and price reactions. Furthermore, our findings indicate that Japanese price revisions tend to be implemented in specific months rather than having any fixed period between shocks and subsequent price revisions. Finally, comparative analyses dividing the 25 years of time series data from 1980 to 2005 into two terms indicate that in recent years price stickiness has been lowering for goods. However, they also indicate that price stickiness has been heightening for services, and the overall price stickiness has not been weakening. This suggests that the increasingly active price adjustment behavior revealed at the microeconomic level may be limited to certain goods only."

 """,2006.,Estimating Continuous Time Transition Matrices From Discretely Observed Data,"06-E-7, Bank of Japan.","A common problem in credit risk management is the estimation of probabilities of rare default events in high investment grades, when sufficient default data are not available. In addressing this issue, increasing attention has been paid to the use of continuous time Markov chains for modeling transition matrices. This approach incorporates the possibility of successive downgrades leading to defaulting in such a way that a very slight probability of default can be captured. In banking applications, however, the approach faces a problem with data limitations, since it requires continuously observed rating data to estimate intensities for transition matrices. In reality, the data frequency of internal rating systems for individual banks is either annual or bi-annual. To make the approach more applicable, the estimation methodology based on discretely observed rating data needs to be examined from a practical perspective. Against this background, the paper discusses and compares the small sample performances of the five estimation methods designed for discrete time observations -- diagonal adjustment, weighted adjustment, quasi-optimization approach, expectation maximization algorithm and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation -- by measuring differences in default probabilities of investment grades and several matrix norms. Monte Carlo experiments reveal that the MCMC gives the most accurate finite-sample performance, both in terms of the estimated default probabilities and the matrix norms. Moreover, a case study to examine the impact on the loss distribution of a hypothetical investment grade portfolio shows that differences in these estimation methods have the potential to yield significantly different estimates of economic capital."

These facts motivate our investigation into the sources of Japanese TFP variations. We consider Japanese and U.S. data that is filtered to retain medium cycle events such as the productivity slow down in the 1970's. An investigation of Japanese medium cycles reveals an important role for the diffusion of business ideas from the U.S. to Japan. U.S. R&D leads Japanese TFP by four years and accounts for as much as 60% of the variation in medium term cycle Japanese TFP. Japanese R&D, in contrast, is coincident with Japanese TFP. Simulations designed to isolate the roles of Japanese and U.S. R&D suggest that the diffusion of knowledge from the U.S. is a key driver of Japanese medium cycles. Interestingly, our theory also accounts for Japan's experience in the 1990s. Slow growth during this period was preceded by a sharp and persistent decline in U.S. R&D."

Workers' remittances to developing countries exceed the amount of official aid and are comparable in amount to the inflow of foreign direct investment for those countries. As such, workers' remittances constitute an important factor in the economic development of developing countries. However, a review of workers' remittance data as recorded in balance of payments statistics points to several significant problems. Specifically, because of inadequate data coverage and narrowness of the scope of workers' remittances, the statistics do not fully meet users' needs. In light of this situation, the need to improve statistics on workers' remittances was brought up at various international meetings, such as the Sea Island Summit and G-8 meetings. Data on workers' remittances in Japan's balance of Payments do not fully reflect the flow of remittances because the reporting threshold is set at a high level. Furthermore, workers' remittance data by country and region, which serve as the source data for the computation of current transfers, are not completely accurate because they are estimated based on the number of foreign residents in Japan. To resolve these problems, it is desirable to promptly improve the source data by lowering the reporting threshold and by collecting remittance data by country and region. Workers' remittances are narrowly defined as ""current transfers by migrants who are employed in new economies and considered residents there."" Ongoing discussions in international meetings aim to revise the definition to cover all remittances made between households. Consideration is also being given to adopting a broader concept of ""personal remittances"" that would include other related transactions, such as compensation of employees and other household-to-household capital transfers. Japanese authorities should participate in these discussions and actively take part in the formulation of guidelines. Once such guidelines have been established, Japanese authorities should act to improve the usefulness of workers' remittance related data by reviewing the transaction codes in its present balance of payments data reporting system."

 """,2005.,Trade Patterns in Japan's Machinery Sector,"05-E-15, Bank of Japan.","This paper analyzes trade patterns in Japan's machinery sector using disaggregated data of export and import commodities. It is found that the vertical intra-industry trade--the two-way trade of products differentiated by quality--with Asian countries expanded in the 1990s. According to the results of the empirical study, this trade pattern is closely related to differences in the capital/labor ratio between Japan and its trading partners, and to Japan's foreign direct investments. It suggests that the development of Japan's trade in the machinery sector in the 1990s is explained by traditional trade theory, i.e., that trade patterns depend on the difference in factor endowment between trading partners. Japan's foreign direct investment, too, has played an important role."

Theoretically, we consider the conditions for the positive average slope of nominal term structure, and show that the slope of a real one is positive. We then calibrate the model to find the following results. First, term premia represents compensation for risk of time-variation in IS shock rather than cost-push and monetary policy shocks. Second, a small slope of the Phillips curve is needed for a positive slope of the term structure. Third, the term structure of the inflation premium is downward on average. Finally, a less aggressive response to output gap in the monetary policy rule leads to lower term premia. The implication for the recent low long rate is also discussed."

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how various measures of bank health and how defaults of major trading partners affected the probability of bankruptcy among medium-size firms in Japan. Using probit models, we examine the causes of bankruptcy for unlisted Japanese companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The environment and events in Japan provide a ""natural experiment"" that allows the empirical test. We find that several measures on bank-specific financial health have significant impacts on a borrower's probability of bankruptcy, even when observable characteristics relating to these borrower's financial variables are controlled for. In particular, a close bank-firm relationship--which usually reduces the probability of bankruptcy--exacerbates the impacts of a financial crisis, which substantially damages other bank health measures as well."

According to the results of our empirical study, which used the major groups of Japan's manufacturing panel data from the 1988-2003, it is clear that the increase in the relative demand for university graduates is closely related to the R&D expenditures ratio (SBTC) and the import ratio from the East Asian countries or the foreign production ratio (globalization). This suggests that there has been a demand shift toward highly educated workers in Japan's manufacturing sector due to both SBTC and globalization."

We provide the results of basic empirical analyses on inflation mechanisms in China. In the context of the relationship between the output gap and the conventional Phillips curve, we find that the output gap proxied by electricity consumption per unit of capital is a better measure of inflation pressure than another alternative. Based on our analysis of the relationship between input and output prices, we show that wage growth is a substantial determinant of inflation. The estimation of the long-run equilibrium relationship between money, output and prices clearly indicates that the money gap (i.e., the gap between the actual and long-run equilibrium levels of money) Granger-causes consumer price inflation. Based on these empirical results, we assess current inflation and the outlook for inflation in China and draw policy implications."

For this purpose, we estimate a Japanese financial accelerator model, which is a modified version of Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist [1999]'s model, and identify the historical exogenous shocks affecting the evolution of firms' net worth. As a result, we confirm that the estimated parameter on the corporate balance sheet channel is statistically significant. We also find that the identified net worth shocks, which change the amount of firms' debt holdings relative to their total values, produced a large and persistent impact on Japan's output and prices. This result strongly suggests that the negative financial accelerator effects were indispensable to explain the mechanism behind Japan's long stagnation during the 1990s and early 2000s, as well as indicating that the deflation of general prices since the late 1990s has been at least partly attributed to the same cause."

In particular, we focus on the effects of the zero interest rate commitment and of quantitative monetary easing on medium- to long-term interest rates in Japan. In the study we apply a version of the macro-finance approach, involving a combination of estimation of a structural macro-model and calibration of time-variant parameters to the yield curve observed in the market. This enables us to decompose interest rates into expectations and risk premium components and simultaneously to extract the market's perception of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ's) willingness to carry on its zero interest rate policy. In the analysis we make clear the counterfactual policy that would have been practiced in the absence of the actual policies followed by the BOJ since 1999. From this analysis, we tentatively conclude that the BOJ's monetary policy since 1999 has functioned mainly through the zero interest rate commitment, which has led to declines in medium- to long-term interest rates. We also find some evidence that, up until the end of 2003, raising the reserve target may have been perceived as a signal indicating the BOJ's accommodative policy stance although the size of the effect is not large. The portfolio rebalancing effect -- either by the BOJ's supplying ample liquidity or by its purchases of long-term government bonds -- has not been found to be significant."

Since the start of the quantitative easing policy, the Bank has raised the target level of current account balances several times. As the target level has far exceeded the level of required reserves, the adoption of the quantitative easing policy means that the Bank has had to provide additional funds to financial institutions that do not have incentives to hold a large amount of excess reserves. Such a policy has been unprecedented for any central bank. Thus, the achievement of the target has been a great challenge to the Bank. Under this policy, the Bank has taken various measures to achieve the target, facing occasional difficulties. Therefore, it would serve as a useful reference for other central banks, market participants, and academics to review the Bank's experiences of monetary policy implementation. In this paper, as staff of the Open Market Operations Desk, we focus on the technical aspects of open market operations from the viewpoint of a practitioner rather than on the academic aspects, such as the effects of the quantitative easing policy on economic activities and prices. Before discussing our experiences with open market operations aimed at achieving the target under the quantitative easing policy in section 4, we will briefly explain the outline of the policy in section 2 and the basic characteristics of open market operations in Japan in section 3."

 """,2005.,The Promotion of Foreign Direct Investment into Japan - The Measures' Impact on FDI Series,"05-E-2, Bank of Japan.","At the occasion of delivering the fiscal year 2003 policy speech, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi proposed to double foreign direct investment (hereafter, FDI) stock into Japan within five years to revitalize the Japanese economy. Against this background, various measures aimed at promoting FDI into Japan have been investigated and implemented by the government and concerned ministries. A number of significant measures implemented in the most recent years to improve the investment environment include introducing a cross-border equity swap scheme and the Japanese version of the limited partnership (Japanese LPs). Consequently, there is a growing interest in examining how these measures could support a growth of FDI into Japan. The first scheme, cross-border equity swaps, involves using shares of a foreign company. This scheme implies that an existing foreign affiliated company operating in Japan initially acquires the shares of a foreign company (for instance, a foreign parent company). These shares will be used to pay for acquiring a Japanese company through either a triangular merger or through the creation of a subsidiary company. According to the IMF Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5), the acquisition of the shares of a foreign parent company by a subsidiary is identified as a ""reverse investment."" This transaction is recorded as an offsetting transaction to inward FDI received from the foreign parent company. For this reason, the likely result of cross-border equity swaps would record contraction of inward FDI flow series. In the second scheme, Japanese LPs combine the advantages of being free from the two-stage taxation and assuring limited liability. For this reason, Japanese LPs could be actively used in the future as an investment vehicle in the cases where investors would be unable to effectively assess the business situation and performance of investee companies in industries requiring the large initial investments, such as technology and R&D. The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Law (Foreign Exchange Law) provides the statutory basis for the compilation of Japan's Balance of Payments (BOP) and International Investment Position (IIP), and the collection of data sources. Within this legal framework, investments by non-residents into Japanese LPs, which are not legal persons, are not defined as FDI into Japan. As a consequence, investments by non-residents into Japanese LPs are excluded from inward FDI flow and stock series. The current statistical treatment implies the following issues. [1] Because investments and collections of investments into Japanese LPs are not included in FDI into Japan, the impact of the introduction of this investment vehicle will not be accurately reflected in FDI series. [2] While this will depend on the volume of investments, strictly speaking, international comparisons with countries including investments into LPs in FDI series and Japan are difficult. Against this background, statistics compilers in Japan could possibly consider the inclusion of investments into Japanese LPs under FDI series within the current framework of the Foreign Exchange Law, provided that the capital participation is 10 percent or more. While giving due consideration to the reporting burden, statistics compilers in Japan should examine how to collect adequate data and reflect it in FDI series."

Specifically, we assume a small structural model composed of the IS and AS curves with both forward-looking and backward-looking agents, and estimate the model using Japanese economic data. Based on the results, we investigate which monetary policy rule is superior, in terms of minimizing social loss, among various policy rules which take the zero lower bound constraint into account. We assume a simple Taylor-type monetary policy rule estimated using the data before the zero interest rate policy was adopted as the baseline policy rule. We then modify this policy rule by adding a policy commitment whereby if deflation occurs the zero interest rate policy will be maintained until the rate of inflation rises beyond a specific level. The analyses indicate that such policy rules can be effective if the contents of the commitment -- that is, the conditions for maintaining the zero interest rate policy -- are set appropriately based on the economic conditions when the commitment is implemented. We also find that monetary policy rules with a nonlinearity, whereby preemptive monetary easing is appropriately implemented as the nominal interest rate approaches zero, perform well if they are regarded as credible, even without any explicit policy commitment."

Our main findings are as follows. First, the trade-off theory provides an appropriate framework to assess this issue after controlling for various variables as proxies for other hypotheses including governance structure, the pecking order theory, and market timing hypothesis. Among such variables, profitability as a proxy for the pecking order theory has significant explanatory power. Second, governance structure significantly influences the speed at which firms adjust their leverage ratios toward optimal ones. In particular, the higher the shareholding ratio of overseas investors, the more quickly market-value leverage ratios adjust. Third, implied excess leverage ratios show a marked contrast between the firms in good credit standing and others. Reduction of excess leverage by highly-rated firms has substantially progressed so far, while others still have a long way to go."

 """,2004.,Listing Change and Stock Price: Impact of Shareholder Diversification and Changes in Liquidity,"04-E-15, Bank of Japan.","When a firm switches its listing venue, there is often a significant increase in the number of shareholders and the trading activities. According to Merton [1987], an increased shareholder base improves diversification of risk, which has a positive impact on the stock price. Amihud and Mendelson [1986] state that improvement in liquidity also has a positive impact on stock price. Most existing research dealt with cases where NASDAQ-listed stocks migrated their listing to the New York Stock Exchange or other exchanges in the U.S.; however, in these cases, it is difficult to extract the pure impact resulted from the increase in the shareholder base because the switching trading mechanisms occur simultaneously. On Japan Securities Dealers Association automated Quotation (JASDAQ) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), analyzed in this study, most of stocks are traded under the same order-driven mechanism in either exchanges, and therefore we don't have any effects originated from difference of trading mechanism. This study measured cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) over the period between the listing change announcement date and the actual date of listing migration for stocks that moved from JASDAQ to the TSE from 1999 to 2002. Our findings confirmed a correlation between CARs and the effect of shareholder diversification. However, this relation is seen only in the stocks transferred to TSE Section I; such relation with the effect of shareholder diversification was not really evident for the stocks transferred to TSE Section II. For stocks transferred to TSE Section I, yen-based trading volume increased noticeably following announcement of listing change, suggesting that such a change is an important factor in stimulating trading that is consistent with current understanding. Also, relatively low abnormal returns were observed for stocks stocked by firms that carried out a public offering or secondary distribution concurrently with listing change in order to satisfy the required number of shareholders. This result shows that changes in abnormal returns and volume are not simply a result of the shift of listing from JASDAQ to the TSE, but are also stimulated by both the transfer process itself and post-transfer trading performance. Empirical results of this study regarding the application procedure for listing change show that public offering/secondary distribution immediately before listing change tends to have a negative impact on the stock price and volume. This suggests the need for appropriate consideration of such impact when making an application for listing change without satisfying the required number of shareholders."

However, the compilation of accurate data based on FCS may prove difficult; Japan and a large majority of other countries/regions have not yet adopted FCS. Consequently, the coverage of indirectly owned enterprises varies across countries, giving rise to the following significant issues: (1) international comparison of statistical data is hindered, (2) when indirectly owned enterprises are not adequately covered, statistical data do not appropriately reflect direct investment activities of enterprises. The IMF, as well as other international organizations and national agencies in charge of statistics are currently working of the revision of the BPM5. Among a large number of issues to be tackled in the revision process, the way of applying FCS is one of the most important issues to be discussed. The ongoing discussions have focused on reviewing the chain of direct investment enterprises without over-simplifying the reality of corporate activities. Major countries of continental Europe, which have not yet adopted FCS similarly to the case of Japan, are currently reviewing their data collection systems for statistical compilation. This indicates that the coverage of direct investment enterprises in the direct investment statistics of these countries might be expanded in the future. Against this background, it is relevant that statistics compilers in Japan consider introducing statistical reporting and compilation methods, as soon as possible, which include indirectly owned enterprises in direct investment enterprises. The suggested study covers the feasibility collecting data on indirectly owned enterprises and adopting concrete measures to include such data in direct investment statistics. This needs to be balanced with reporting burden."

Second, we examine the response of long-term interest rates or an implied forward curve to FOMC's policy changes by employing a version of the new IS/LM model. The result shows that the observed financial market response to the FOMC's statement released in August 2003 can be no less consistent with an effective change in the expectation of the degree of interest rate inertia than a failed policy commitment. Our simulation suggests that we cannot conclude that the Fed's commitment was ineffective during the recent phase of stagnation."

A series of impulse response analyses indicate an important transmission channel across countries, namely the output-multiplier effect, that has been overlooked in models using only bilateral trade relationships.

This causes term spreads to react to inflation shocks, which proves useful for prediction.

Our main findings are as follows. First, if the no-arbitrage conditions for both domestic and foreign banks' foreign currency funding costs between the foreign currency market and the FX swap market hold, then the yen funding costs for foreign banks in the FX swap market can be written as the sum of (i) the yen risk- free interest rate, (ii) the credit risk premium for foreign banks, and (iii) the difference in the credit-risk premium for domestic banks between the yen and the U.S. dollar markets. Second, the recent negative yen funding costs for foreign banks result from the fact that the credit-risk premium for domestic banks is higher in the U.S. dollar market than in the yen market. Third, the difference in credit-risk premium between the yen and the U.S. dollar markets has existed at least since the beginning of the 1990s. As the yen risk-free interest rate has declined under the quantitative monetary easing policy, however, the difference in credit-risk premium has become marked, yielding the negative funding costs. Finally, the yen funding costs are expected to return to zero percent if foreign banks could invest in the risk-free Bank of Japan's current account balances without limits. In reality, however, the yen funding costs have remained below zero percent since foreign banks face credit lines, which limit the holdings of the current account balances."

With skewness, risk premium can be expressed as a weighted average of beta-risk under the orthodox beta-CAPM and gamma-risk arising from skewness. We call the pricing model with gamma-risk gamma-CAPM. The weight between beta-risk and gamma-risk is determined mainly by the degree of relative risk aversion. Empirical results using Japanese data show that (i) specification tests tend to accept gamma-CAPM, rejecting beta-CAPM, and (ii) the estimated values of the degree of relative risk aversion are significantly positive on the whole, but become negative when BBB-rated corporate bonds are included in the sub-sample estimation, which covers the period after the adoption of the zero interest rate policy by the Bank of Japan. Also, empirical results using U.S. data show that (iii) the estimated values of the degree of relative risk aversion are much higher than the values estimated by Japanese data, and (iv) the average weight of gamma-risk is 10.7 percent in the U.S., compared with 3.2 percent in Japan. This means that gamma-risk is priced in U.S. corporate bonds to a larger degree than in the Japanese corporate bonds. These findings imply that Japanese investors have taken excessive credit risk, particularly in BBB-rated corporate bonds under the low interest rate environment."

Japan's balance of royalties and license fees had remained consistently in deficit since statistics were first compiled until a surplus was registered for the first time in 2003. This reflects growth in royalty receipts from the overseas subsidiaries of Japanese companies (non-resident corporations) resulting from the globalization of manufacturing activities, which in turn has been promoted by such developments as the avoidance of trade friction by Japanese manufacturing industries, countermeasures to combat loss of price competitiveness due to the appreciation of the yen, and declining market-entry costs pursuant to expanding WTO membership. A review of current developments identifies the following major contributors to the emergence of a surplus. By industry, transportation equipment has played a leading role, and by region, receipts from North America have been critical. Overseas production of automobiles by Japanese companies is expected to increase over the coming years in North America and Europe, while manufacturing in Asia is now taking off. Consequently, the outlook is for the surplus in royalties and license fees to continue growing in the years ahead. On the other hand, in the area of software, the competitive position of Japanese companies remains weak (as evidenced by continued deficits in copyright-related payments). Moreover, the recent surplus can be essentially attributed to intra-firm trade in specific industries, such as transportation equipment and electrical machinery. Thus, it cannot be said with any finality that the competitive position of Japanese companies in the area of intellectual property has improved significantly. In its progress toward a truly technology-based economy, it would be a desirable option for Japan to boost receipts from extra-firm transactions in both software and hardware by achieving higher levels of technology and maturity."

This paper analyzes the ""network"" structure of financial transactions, using the logged data of financial transactions through the BOJ-Net (Current Account of the Bank of Japan), which became obtainable after the introduction of RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) in 2001. This study uses recently developed methods of statistical physics. This field of study provides an analytical framework that treats the complex structure of financial institutions as a structure of elements, or ""nodes,"" that are connected to one another, through ""links."" Our study shows that the ""network"" of financial transactions between financial institutions possess fractal structure, similar to that observed in network structures in the natural world (such as river basins) or the structure of the Internet. We also find that financial institutions situated in the middle of the network structure hold more links than those institutions on the periphery of the network, implying that the formed structure is a result of the pursuance of ""efficiency"" rather than ""stability."" We should pay enough attention to the dynamic nature of the network structure in order to evaluate its stability, since the network structure of financial transactions is not static in nature(the network is not based upon hardware like cables, as in the case of the Internet).

This is achieved by embedding a mechanism within which ""short-run dynamics,"" basically captured by a vector autoregression model, eventually converge to a ""short-run equilibrium,"" which is defined using a dynamic general equilibrium-type model."

To do so, we estimate nonlinear land investment functions using micro panel corporate data, and calculate the partial q for land assets taking account of their collateral role. The land investment functions reveal that firms, in particular those in the real estate related industries, have been net sellers of land in the 1990s, mainly in response to the decline in sales and the deterioration in financial conditions after the bursting of the bubble. Moreover, manufacturing firms have also sold land because of the hike in the overseas production ratio. Partial q shows that the market price of land held by the real estate related industries has exceeded its shadow price since the latter half of the 1980s. For other industries, market land prices declined to the level of their shadow prices around the middle of the 1990s. However, since then market prices have once again found themselves above their shadow prices, in the face of the pessimistic expectations revealed by distressed share prices after 1997."

The results are, firstly, to confirm, in the face of these demographic changes, (1) the increasing difficulty of maintaining the current social security system, (2) the decrease in the number of workers, and (3) the gradual decline of the household savings rate. Secondly, calculations based on a simple model show a reduction in the labor input and a slowdown in the accumulation of capital, indicating that the potential macroeconomic growth rate will also undergo a decline. Furthermore, in order to compensate for the decrease in the number of workers that accompanies such demographic changes, we include in the model some extreme conditions on rates of employment for the elderly and for women as well as on immigration and fertility rates. Even under such extreme conditions, it still proves difficult to completely neutralize the negative demographic effects on the potential growth rate."

 """,2003.,Output Composition of the Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism in Japan,"03-E-9, Bank of Japan.","In this paper, I investigate the output composition of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Japan. The predominant channel via which monetary policy affects output in Japan is usually thought to be the investment channel, namely the process whereby a change in the interest rate alters the cost of capital and therefore investment. In the United States, however, the consumption channel, which works through intertemporal substitution, is commonly considered the more significant of the two. The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) based on analysis using VAR and DSGE models, to understand which of the two channels; the consumption channel or the investment channel, plays the more important role in the transmission of Japanese monetary policy; and 2) to contribute to the research on what Angeloni, Kashyap, Mojon and Terlizzese (2003) term the ""Output Composition Puzzle,"" referring to the fact that whereas in the United States the predominant driver of output changes is the consumption channel, in the Euro area it is the investment channel. The results obtained from the Japanese models are consistent with our intuition that the investment channel is more important."

He insists that the central bank can thus reduce the social costs brought about by negative shocks to the economy. This line of argument, however, does not explicitly consider the social costs arising from the positive inflation rate itself, but emphasizes only the benefits of a reduced risk of hitting the nominal interest rate bound. In this paper, I consider both the benefits and costs of maintaining a positive ex ante inflation rate as a way of circumventing the discomfort imposed by zero bound constraints. I show that this trade-off between the costs and benefits broadly determines the desirable rate of positive ex ante inflation that the central bank should pursue. By using simple model simulations, I conclude with these two points. Firstly, there in fact exists a desirable rate of positive ex ante inflation whose benefits exceed its costs. By parameterizing the model with average values from past Japanese experience, this finding is also shown to have been applicable to Japan. Secondly, this desirable level of the inflation rate largely depends on the degree of forward-lookingness in the economy, and the size and persistence of shocks generated."

These recessions are commonly attributed to nominal interest rates coming up against the zero bound and to the delay in achieving necessary structural changes. However, since these two factors had not yet appeared in the early 1990s, there must also have been other factors acting to weaken the effectiveness of monetary policy. In this paper, we employ Japanese data to conduct an empirical analysis of changes in the effect of monetary policy on the real economy. We find that monetary policy effects vary depending on the phase of the business cycle (measured in terms of the rate of change in real output) and the lending attitudes DI. More precisely, policy effects are larger in recession but diminish in extreme recession, and monetary policy is more effective when lenders' attitudes are severe but less effective when they are excessively severe."

Having been designed to foster growth, the postwar financial system did contribute to Japan's rapid economic expansion. As such, it served an instrumental role in bringing about what was termed the ""Japanese Miracle.""

With the mounting burdens of non-performing loan that ensued, the financial system has since been remained as an issue of concern in the Japanese economy's ""lost decade."" As recent research indicates, an economic system that is successful within one set of environmental conditions could lead to failure if those conditions change. Such environmental changes need not be purely external. The overall institutional arrangements surrounding the system may misfit with the changing environment and ultimately make the original system somewhat incompatible or obsolete. The financial system of postwar Japan has been described as a classic example of this phenomenon. This paper looks back to the key development of Japan's postwar financial system, and then makes some conclusions about the main features of Japan's system."

One important motivation for this policy arises from the idea that utilizing modern financial tools, i.e., securitization, can be a possible way to solve the overconcentration or excess accumulation of credit risks in the banking sector, albeit it would be a rare move for central banks to buy private debt. The outright purchase is expected to restore the monetary transmission mechanism by helping diversify credit risks in the financial sector among other economic agents including the BOJ. The other motivation of the new policy is to increase fundraising options for SMEs. For example, the BOJ will purchase ABS backed by accounts receivable. The use of accounts receivable as collateral is not a popular fundraising method for SMEs in Japan. SMEs can take advantage of the BOJ's policy to utilize quality assets which have not been effectively used as collateral in the past. SME external financial sources can be multi-tracked, thereby reducing their heavy reliance upon traditional financial intermediation. Thus, through the implementation of ""traditional"" monetary policy tools to purchase ""untraditional"" financial assets, the policy is expected to strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. The spirit of this policy is to effectively improve SME access to financing through accelerating the development of ABS markets, without causing distortions in the ABS markets. The scheme is carefully designed to avoid any moral hazards and to contribute to the removal of obstacles to SME financing through enhancing financial disintermediation."

Under the ZIRP, particularly the short-term and medium-term interest rates are so low that we face difficulty applying traditional yield curve models such as the Vasicek model to them. This circumstance motivated us to model the expectations of market participants on the duration of the ZIRP by regarding it as one of the risk factors of a yield curve. To be specific, we constructed a yield curve model with the following two interest-rate generating process by maturity zone: (i) the short-term interest rate zone follows the traditional Vasicek model augmented by incorporating the probability of policy duration as one of the risk factors, and (ii) the long-term interest rate zone is determined by risk prices perceived in markets. By taking these steps, we significantly improved the fitting of the yield curve model under the ZIRP."

First, we build an intertemporal decision-making model under uncertainty in the presence of transaction costs. This setting enables us to shed light on the investors' option to delay investment. A comparative analysis shows that an increase in uncertainty over the expected rate of return on mutual funds has a negative impact not only on market participants' buying behavior but on their selling behavior. Also, a several percent increase in front-end loads and redemption fees is likely to change the optimal holding ratio of mutual funds in investors' portfolios, by up to 10 percent. Second, we empirically examine the theoretical implications using daily transaction data of selected equity mutual funds in Japan. By estimating a panel data model, we conclude that for the sample period, from August 2000 to July 2001, investment behavior has been rational in light of our theoretical model. Our results suggest that investors are likely to rationally postpone their purchases of equity mutual funds under the present circumstances of low expected returns, high degree of uncertainty, and high trading costs."

This method is equivalent to estimating the total for the stratum population by filling in missing values with the stratum mean. However, in Tankan survey, the variance within each stratum is comparatively large, so that we must consider the possibility of large deviations between the stratum mean and the true values of nonrespondents.

The purpose of this paper is to construct a macro-econometric model for the Asia-Pacific area, including Japan, the United States, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, Hong Kong, and China. The model captures international specialization among regional neighbors in a simple way and enables us to quantify how their deepening interdependence affects economic activities in the area. Our main findings are as follows: (i) A Japanese recession may cause recession in East Asia and thereby rebound on Japanese exports. (ii) The depreciation of the Japanese yen favors its exports, but has a ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" effect on the East Asian economies. (iii) Foreign-demand shocks affect Japanese exports differently, depending on whether the shocks come from, say, the US or Asia. Moreover, the model includes policy rules (interest rate policy, exchange rate policy, and capital controls) to reflect the differing monetary policies observed in individual countries. These make it possible to simulate a change in a country's adopted policy rule and to quantify the effects of such a change, both on other countries and on itself. Using this model structure, we investigate which currency regime is most favorable for the East Asian economies. Our simulation results imply that (iv) it may be more desirable than the current policy regime or the US dollar peg that all the East Asian economies adopt the currency basket policy in order to preserve economic stability against turbulence arising inside or outside the East Asian economies."

We show theoretically that this inflation-neutral potential rate of growth is determined by three factors: the rate of technological progress, the growth rates of the production factors, and the shift in the NAIRU. We conduct empirical analysis for Japan since the latter half of the 1980s and show that all three factors have contributed to the lowering of the Japanese potential rate of growth since the early 1990s. In particular, we discover that it was the shift in the NAIRU that caused the protracted period of slowdown in Japanese potential growth around the midst of the 1990s. Furthermore, we show that since 2000, with the strengthening of East Asian international competitiveness, Japan has been driven to substantial reform of its old economic structure, and this may have brought about an acceleration of the shift in the NAIRU. We also point out that the NAIRU estimate and its relationship with the inflation rate are subject to various kinds of uncertainty, and thus care should be taken in their evaluation and interpretation."

However, such techniques cannot avoid running into the possibility of misspecification, which will occur should there be some error in the assumptions underlying this economic structure. Even when diagnostic tests have been easily cleared, a small change in the way this structure is set up can induce large differences in the forecast value. In other words, the researcher's subjective choices in setting up the model can have a substantial influence on the estimated forecast. In this paper, in which we concentrate upon inflation forecasting, we present a statistical forecasting method (SFM) that stresses statistical relationships among time series data, and that makes no structural assumptions, other than to set up the underlying variables. When putting together a forecast, this SFM first builds a number of VAR models from combinations of the underlying variables; it then automatically ranks these, based upon their performance. Furthermore, it has the additional property that it produces forecasts not merely by looking at the movements of the forecast themselves over time, but by taking into account the uncertainty in both the model and the forecast value captured in the forecast distribution (and illustrated in the fan charts). We also carry out analysis that looks just at the question of whether future inflation will move upwards or downwards, attempting to produce a qualitative forecast of this movement."

In our search model, the Central Limit Theorem implies that the multiplier is a non-linear function of the aggregate level of bank assets. Thus when banks have little capital, there emerges an inefficient equilibrium where the production level is low and unemployment exists.

This phenomenon is known as forbearance lending. We illustrate this using a simple model in which a bank is shown to have an incentive to engage in forbearance lending to a borrower firm whose debt-asset ratio exceeds a certain threshold as its liquidation value (or net worth) is eroded. Then, using corporate panel data, we test for non-linearity between loans and debt-asset ratios: i.e. whether loans were apt to increase to a firm whose debt-asset ratio was above a certain level. It is found that, after the bubble burst, this non linearity became evident for non-manufacturing firms, especially those in the construction and real estate industries. Furthermore, an increase in loans to highly indebted firms in these industries is found to lower their profitability. These findings are consistent with the view that forbearance lending certainly took place in Japan, and that it suppressed the profitability of inefficient non-manufacturing firms."

Based on the Bank's ample experiences of compiling the CSPI, this paper has introduced the actual methods of quality adjustment to compile the CSPI and the results of quality adjustment in 2000. The Bank has been endeavoring to adjust the quality as much as possible by using various methods as well as to introduce many newly expanding service items at the time of revising the base year and collect as many samples as possible in compiling the CSPI. The small degree of declines in prices estimated from quality adjustment successfully indicates the features of the services industries--that is, their low productivity. Still, such quality adjustment has faced many obstacles that are connected to how the output of services should be defined. Technological innovation induced by the progress of information technology and heterogeneity of services accelerated by deregulation and supplemented by information technology have become the two biggest recent changes and these changes have complicated quality adjustment in service prices. These obstacles are not confined to Japan only; rather, they should be considered as applicable to service prices worldwide. This paper has drawn out the many limitations involved in capturing the quality of services concretely, and has suggested directions toward expanding varieties of quality adjustment methods. As for services of which output can be determined by the amount of labor inputs and capital inputs, the existing production cost method is still valid, but wider application of the hedonic regression method should be developed. On the other hand, as for services for which it is difficult to use production functions and of which the output is determined by the behavior of demand, inventing econometric models that comprise the concept of saving or consuming time by using services, and utilizing survey data on customer satisfaction should be developed. Furthermore, when the assumption of perfect competition does not hold, inventing other econometric models that take account of the monopolistic behavior of service producers is necessary. Based on the above features of services, all of these new approaches focus on the demand side of services, not the producer side. It is important to continue to develop and utilize quality adjustment methods more positively and to further improve the accuracy of quality adjustment."

Service prices are the most problematic areas in capturing actual price trends according to our ample experience in compiling this index. Capturing service prices has attracted many concerns of statistics organizations and users worldwide. Telecommunications services, especially, are an area of focus; they are characterized by rapid growth, by being driven by information technology, and by being advanced by government deregulation.

We find that (i) during the 1990s, the amount of sectoral credit shifts declined significantly, which was responsible for---in conjunction with effects from falls in land prices and aggregate outstanding loans---the stagnated real growth; and (ii) the decline in the credit shifts in the 1990s reflected weakened financial intermediation rather than a decrease in the size of sectoral shocks. These results are consistent with the view that financial intermediation was weakened by the exacerbated non-performing loan problems after the collapse of the asset price bubble, and thus prevented credits from shifting to relatively efficient sectors."

Given that some taxes are not lump-sum but subject to the proportional/progressive tax schedule, and that taxes are levied on nominal income instead of real income, an increase in the inflation rate has a distortional effect because it raises the effective tax rates. This paper tries to estimate that effect by taking Japan's institutional background fully into account and by applying the general equilibrium framework of Abel [1997]. The current costs of the higher inflation are found to be larger in Japan compared with those in other industrial countries, because of the lower rate of corporate capital return."

It is probable that such movements would see further progress in the future, involving more member economies (the members of already existing international organizations, regional members, members at different stages of economic development) and applying different schemes (fund lending, currency swaps, currency swaps by currency). The role of central banks in such an environment is likely to be an issue as well. Thus, having considered the situation, I believe it indispensable to thoroughly evaluate the importance of liquidity provision as well as the role that should be played by central banks. In this paper, as background material for such discussion, I have surveyed the theories and empirical analyses put forward to explain the outbreak of past currency crises, the aggravation of crises, and the mechanism that leads to a drop in total output of a crisis-hit country. As for the scope of the survey, I have mainly focused on the Asian currency crisis (1997), which shares the closest relation with our economy."

Here we define the potential output as the non-accelerating-inflation level of output (NLO). The NLO is not a mere trend of the actual output, but rather is a critical level of output with the following property: If the actual output is at this level, the inflation rate is neither accelerated nor decelerated. Applying our method to the data on the G7 countries, we estimate the NLO and Phillips curves and investigate their properties. It is shown that during the 1980s and 1990s, the output gap measured from the NLO was negative on average, reflecting the worldwide trend of disinflation. We also point out that the output gap has moved in accordance with corporate sentiments, and thus serves as an indicator of business conditions. In Japan, however, after the potential rate of growth dropped between 1 and 2 percent in the mid-1990s, the output gap was too volatile to allow for accurate evaluation. As for Phillips curves, a cross-country comparison shows that Japan's responsiveness of inflation to the output gap is relatively weak."

In Japan, prices have been stable since the 1990s, although some declining phases have also been observed. Under these conditions, lively discussions are emerging regarding the ""actual trend""of prices while focusing on the accuracy of price indexes. Hayakawa and Yoshida (2001) present the idea that the problems surrounding price indexes are not limited to how statisticians confront technical problems of price indexes. Moreover, they insist that the problems are how they grasp the prices of a good or service, and furthermore they are connected to more fundamental issues of how price stability should be defined. In fact, from the viewpoint of the statistics section compiling the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Corporate Service Price Index (CSPI), we regularly face such problems as how to grasp the prices of goods and services and thus more or less agree with this opinion. Even if we limit the topic to price indexes compiled by the Bank of Japan, concerns still abound. These include the extent to which the WPI incorporates productivity growth represented by Information Technology (IT) as the Japanese economy undergoes rapid change through IT, and the question of whether the CSPI accurately reflects the progress in services and permeating effects of IT on nonmanufacturing. Furthermore, by taking these discussions into account, there is the issue of how effectively the price indexes reflect the balance between supply and demand. To provide price indexes that reflect the actual conditions of the economy as accurately as possible in response to such discussions, quality adjustment of price indexes has become the most essential issue among the many difficulties of price indexes. This paper will discuss in detail some ideas from the viewpoint of statistics compilers on how important quality adjustment is for price indexes when grasping prices. It will also attempt to clarify some issues concerning the use of price indexes obtained from previous studies. In line with this, the paper will highlight problems that cannot be solved even by using various quality adjustment methods and will, we hope, provide some insights for future domestic and international research."

 """,2001.,Insights into the Low Profitability of Japanese Banks: Some Lessons from the Analysis of Trends in Banks' Margins,"Bank Examination and Surv, Bank of Japan.","Developments in overall margins of Japanese banks have shown no major change during the last twenty years: a slight contraction in the early 1980s, followed by a discrete expansion during the bubble period, have only served to highlight their extreme stability. Meanwhile, net overall margins after considering loan-losses have been negative since fiscal 1993 as overall margins failed to respond to soaring loan-losses. By dividing overall margins into the lending spread and the fund-raising spread, we find that the fund-raising spread contracted considerably from the 1980s to the 1990s while the lending spread expanded considerably during the same period. The change in fund-raising spread is attributable to two factors: a decline in so-called ""rent"" owing to deregulation of deposit interest rates since the middle of the 1980s and a fall in market interest rates to close to zero. Meanwhile, the change in lending spread is partly attributable to a rising consciousness of credit risk among banks since the early 1990s. The expansion of lending spread, however, has only offset the contraction of fund-raising spread and stopped short of covering loan losses, suggesting that banks regarded soaring credit costs since the early 1990s as temporary losses to be covered by capital, not as current losses to be covered by overall margins."

An efficient government bond market is indispensable from the standpoint of financial policy operations in order (1) to secure reliable information which reflects market participants' outlook on interest rates, and (2) to carry out smooth market operations using government bonds. However, there are various problems with respect to the government bond markets, related to both market structure and the behavior of market participants, and thus they are vulnerable to stress. The experience of summer 1999, where a widespread decline in market liquidity was observed in the government bond markets prompted in part by a shock which materialized in the repo market, is still fresh in our minds. In this paper, we explore various developments in Japanese government bond markets, focusing on the connection between the behavior and incentives of market participants and the effect they have had on market liquidity.

 """,2000.,Effects of Measurement Error on the Output Gap in Japan,"Research and Statistics D, Bank of Japan."," Potential output is the largest amount of products that can be produced by fully utilizing available labor and capital stock; the output gap is defined as the discrepancy between actual and potential output. If data on production factors contain measurement errors, total factor productivity (TFP) cannot be estimated accurately from the Solow residual (i.e., the portion of output that is not attributable to labor and capital inputs). This may give rise to distortions in the estimation of potential output and output gap. The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss theoretically how measurement errors and quality changes in production factors affect estimates of potential output and the output gap. The main results are (i) that effects of quality changes in production factors can be left in the Solow residual for correct estimation of potential output and the output gap, but (ii) that measurement errors in utilization of capital stock and labor should be removed. Estimation of Japan's output gap, in particular, may be distorted by the absence of data on capacity utilization in non-manufacturing sectors. To resolve this problem, we consider two definitions of output gap and compare their performance. The first definition (the conventional output gap) assumes capacity utilization to be 100% in non-manufacturing sectors. Then we fit a certain trend to the Solow residual and define the trend as TFP and the regression residual as capacity utilization in non-manufacturing sectors. The second definition (the new output gap) uses data on electricity consumption to directly estimate capacity utilization in non-manufacturing sectors. In this case, we can take the Solow residual to be TFP. Next, we compare the performance of the two definitions of output gap in terms of their consistency with reference dates of business cycle and with various DIs in Short-term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan published by the Bank of Japan, including business conditions DI. We show that the ""new output gap"" is superior to the ""conventional output gap."" Furthermore, when the new output gap is used in a Phillips curve, estimates of parameters are more stable than when we use the conventional output gap. These results suggest that the new output gap is a suitable measure of slackness in the Japanese economy."

 """,2000.,Predicting the US Real GDP Growth Using Yield Spreads of Corporate Bonds,"International Department,, Bank of Japan."," In general, the yield spread between long- and short-term bonds contains useful information for future economic activity and inflation. Particularly, it usually reflects market participants' expectations of future monetary policy and credit demand. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to extract such information from the yield spread of government bonds in the US because of the impact of the so-called ""flight to quality"" where investors seek refuge in risk-free government bonds during a financial crisis, and also because of a reduction in the new issue of such bonds. This paper examines the power of the yield spread of corporate bonds as a substitute for government bonds in predicting economic activity. From empirical studies, we find that the yield spread of corporate bonds is a more effective predictor than government bonds for economic activity. Since the mid-1990s, the US fiscal balance has rapidly improved. As a result, the risk premium stemming from accumulating public debt has decreased, leading to the structural narrowing of the yield spread. After excluding the impact of the improved fiscal situation, we find that the yield spreads of both corporate and government bonds provide more useful information for future economic activity. Considering the relatively stable credit risk premium observed in corporate bond yields, more attention should be paid to the information contained in the yield spread of corporate bonds for future economic activity. Our estimation indicate that the current level of yield spread of corporate bonds predicts the strong continuous expansion of the U.S. economy extending into the near future."

Among them was the Internal Risk Based (IRB) approach, in which individual banks' internal loss data would be effectively taken into account while the structure of the scheme would be kept relatively simple and comparable compared to the structure of ""full model"" type approaches. IRB approach can bridge the gap between a basic approach and a more advanced approach, providing a clear and evolutionary path that leads banks to more sophisticated approaches on a business line by business line basis.

The momentum of economic recovery is expected to increase backed by stronger domestic demand in 2000. The Consensus Forecasts indicate higher growth in most countries in 2000. However, the high growth in the pre-crisis period has not yet been resumed especially in ASEAN-4 because stock adjustment in the construction sector will continue as a result of the negative legacy inherited from the real estate bubble, and also because capital inflows will remain subdued reflecting balance sheet problems in the financial and corporate sectors."

 """,1999.,Does Japan Save Too Much? Or Do Other Major Countries Save Too Little? International comparison of savings rates from the modified golden rule approach,"Research and Statistics D, Bank of Japan."," The purpose of this paper is to examine whether Japan's savings (investment) rate is higher than the optimal level in the neoclassical framework and if so why. Our first finding is that Japan saves optimally when the rate of time preference is assumed to be zero while it over-saves when the real interest rate is used to approximate the rate of time preference. Meanwhile, major Western countries except Germany save close to the optimal level when the real interest rate is assumed to be the rate of time preference while they under-save when the time preference is set to be zero. We also calculate the implicit rate of time preference, assuming that the actual saving rate is equal to the optimal level and found that Japan and Germany have a low and stable time preference throughout the period while the other major countries show a rapid rise in the rate of time preference after the late 1970's. Regarding European countries except Germany, we make a case that the household sector, which is supposed to have a higher time preference than the other sectors, became more sensitive to the capital returns gained by the corporate sector since the end of the 1970s when capital's share of income had started to rise. This increasing sensitivity of the household sector to capital returns led to contain corporate sector capital expenditure and to stimulate instead household consumption. Based on these analyses, we conclude that Japan's savings are not too high for the purpose of maximizing long-term economic growth. The low and stable rate of time preference may reflect the fact that the Japanese corporate sector has not been exposed to stricter corporate governance or more intense pressures from institutional investors. As a result, the corporate sector has been able to make investment decisions based on its own time preference. These factors for the low and stable time preference in Japan, however, have started to fade out gradually as Japanese capital markets go through the same experience seen in Europe during the 1980s. This implies that Japan's savings rate is likely to decline, and, consequently, the investment-savings gap ratio over GDP may start to diminish in the near future."

Among the three Japan premiums, the relationship that ""the Japan premium in the dollar currency market = the Japan premium in the yen currency market + the Japan premium in the dollar/yen swap market"" generally holds. However, in the autumn of both 1997 and 1998, there were times when this relationship did not hold. Possible reasons for the divergence of the swap rate from the theoretical value derived from its underlying assets (dollar interest rate, yen interest rate, dollar/yen spot rate) are two-fold: First, the price of underlying assets might not fully reflect risk premium implicitly existing in the market. Second, the widening of the information gap (asymmetry) concerning the creditworthiness of Japanese banks among market participants could have a bearing. The results support the possibility of both. When information concerning the creditworthiness of domestic banks in foreign and domestic markets widens, the foreign exchange swap market may function more as a foreign currency funding market than the foreign currency cash market. Based on these understandings, it is important to carefully monitor the foreign exchange swap market as well as to make efforts to improve its functioning. Information gaps between domestic and foreign market participants should be narrowed in order to reduce risk premium attached to the foreign currency funding cost of domestic banks."

 """,1998.,The Yield Spread as a Predictor of Japanese Recessions,"Research and Statistics D, Bank of Japan.","Economists have used various financial economic indicators to forecast economic activity. For example, the information contained in the term structure of interest rates has long been regarded as useful for predicting future economic activity. And recently, this topic has received renewed attention as a result of the increasing importance of bond markets behavior for monetary policy and real economic activity in developed economies. Estrella and Mishkin (1996a, b) have found that the yield spread the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates contains useful information for predicting recessions in the U.S. economy by employing the Probit type estimation. They have also found that the yield spread outperforms the stock prices and other leading economic indicators in predicting recessions over forecasting horizons longer than a quarter. In this article, we apply the Estrella-Mishkin analysis to the Japanese economy. The results are somewhat tentative, given the relatively short duration of the period of free interest rate movements, that is, the period since the late 1970s. Nonetheless we find that (1) The yield spread does predict Japanese recessions, based on the Probit model. (2) Other financial variables also predict recessions. The monetary aggregates predict recessions well, but they are also close to a coincident indicator. The stock price is a leading indicator of real economic activity, but is a noisy indicator. Among the three, the yield spread seems to be the best leading indicator of recessions. On the other hand, (3) The predictive power of the yield spread in the Japanese financial markets, however, is not so strong as that in the U. S. markets. For example, in simple OLS regressions of indicators of economic activity on the yield spread, the yield spread is insignificant at a quarterly frequency, though it is significant at a monthly frequency.

 """,1998.,Searching for the Long-Run Relations between Monetary Aggregates and Other Macroeconomic Variables in Japan: A Vector Error Correction Approach,"Research and Statistics D, Bank of Japan.","This paper proposes a vector error correction model of five economic variables in Japan: money, income, general price, land price, and interest rate. Following Johansen's procedure, we find three unique cointegrating vectors, which are accepted by hypothesis testing. From the viewpoint of long-run economic relations, these three vectors are interpreted as equations determining the equilibrium levels of general price, money, and land price respectively. When controlling the effect of land price, the long-run income elasticity of M2+CDs is estimated to be near unity and fairly stable over time. On the other hand, the long-run relation between M2+CDs and the GDP deflator is found not so simple as can be represented by one to one correspondence, although these two variables are to some extent positively linked with each other. Tests for weak exogeneity and application to forecasting are also implemented."

By using time series cross section data on wages from the Japanese Wage Census, we find that wages do not exhibit serious downward rigidity. They do decline when macro labor market conditions worsen even in periods of low inflation rate. Japanese wages per man-hour, however, do not respond to micro shocks. Firms have avoided large employment adjustments in response to micro shocks by changing overtime hours worked. We tentatively conclude that there is no long-run trade off between the goal of stable prices and low unemployment in Japan."

In this paper, we examine the developments in Japan's energy intensity, a measure of energy efficiency, and their background at the aggregate and sectoral levels. The main results are as follows. Energy efficiency in Japan improved considerably between the 1970s and the 1980s, mainly due to the progress in energy-saving technical changes in the business sector. Although the pace of improvement decelerated on the whole from the 1990s to the first half of the 2000s, Japan's energy efficiency has returned to a moderate improving trend, particularly in the household sector, in recent years. Our estimate using a simple model of the household sector shows that the recent improvement in aggregate energy efficiency may reflect households' purchases and utilization of energy-saving goods produced by the business sector. Further efforts are expected to be made in each sector to achieve carbon neutrality."

 ""","""undated"".",Inflation in Japan: Changes during the Pandemic and Issues for the Future,"22-E-18, Bank of Japan.","As the impact of COVID-19 pandemic eased and economic activity resumed, prices have risen sharply in the U.S. and Europe, partly due to the impact of rising commodity prices. Although not to the same extent as the U.S. and Europe, in Japan inflation rates have also been rising, especially for goods prices. In order to further develop the discussion on the nature of these recent price developments in Japan and their outlook, this paper (1) summarizes the characteristics of inflation dynamics in Japan before the spread of COVID-19, mainly using the framework of the Phillips curve, (2) confirms the recent changes and characteristics of price developments, and (3) summarizes the issues for the future. Based on the fact-finding of this paper, we conclude it is important to accumulate analyses on the stickiness of service prices, nominal wage rigidity, and uncertainty in inflation expectations, which are characteristic of Japan, in order to further deepen the discussion on these recent price developments."

However, many issues remain unclear, such as what kind of households have increased their online consumption and whether the increase in online consumption is temporary or highly persistent. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of online consumption trends during the pandemic, using (i) granular tailor-made data from the Survey of Household Economy by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and (ii) aggregated figures computed from transaction data from ""Money Forward ME,"" the personal financial management service provided by Money Forward, Inc. Our empirical results based on these datasets up to December 2020 show that online consumption in Japan increased among a wide range of age and income groups, that many households engaged in online consumption for the first time during the pandemic, and that most of these households continued to engage in online consumption. While it should be noted that the results are based on a limited observation period, they suggest that the increase in online consumption likely is highly persistent. If such changes in household behavior are indeed highly persistent, they may have important implications for Japan's economy."

 ""","""undated"".",Labor Market of Regular Workers in Japan: A Perspective from Job Advertisement Data,"23-E-7, Bank of Japan.","We analyze labor market tightness and wages for regular workers in Japan, using online job advertisement big data from 2015 to 2022 (approximately 5.8 million samples). The analysis reveals several aspects of the labor market which cannot be captured by official statistics. First, the ratio of job postings matched to job applicants (job-filling rate) has been declining, which suggests that firms may be facing greater difficulties in hiring workers than indicated by macro indicators such as jobs-to-applicants ratio. Second, the decline in the job-filling rate is in part driven by an increase in skill requirements of firms. This is related to the observed acceleration in the accumulation of intangible assets, which has a complementary effect in raising demand for high skilled workers. Third, posted wages are clearly rising under tightening labor market conditions, driven by an increase in demand for high skilled workers. Fourth, an increase in posted wages spills over to average wages of regular workers with some time lag. As for this spillover mechanisms, our empirical results support the existence of (1) a channel in which firms raise wages in order to retain workers as it becomes easier for them to move to higher paying jobs, and (2) a channel in which firms raise wages for fairness consideration as newly hired workers are paid high wages within a firm."

Using alternative data that become timely available, this paper aims to capture developments in Japan's private consumption at the macro level earlier than existing statistics. We construct the ""Alternative Data Consumption Index"" (ALC) by combining three types of alternative data: (1) credit card transaction data (JCB Consumption NOW); (2) point-of-sale (POS) data (METI POS and GfK); and (3) spending records obtained from a personal financial management service (Money Forward). We nowcast the Consumption Activity Index (CAI), which is compiled and released by the Bank of Japan, using the ALC. With respect to timeliness, the ALC has a significant advantage over the CAI; the ALC for the month is available in the middle of the following month, approximately 3 weeks earlier than the release of the CAI. Our findings show that the ALC is generally accurate in nowcasting the CAI and thus aggregate consumption developments. It also accurately captures the substantial changes in consumption activities caused by the spread of COVID-19 since spring 2020. Overall, the results suggest that alternative data can capture macro level consumption activity promptly and accurately, making them a powerful tool for understanding economic conditions."

The Effects of Work from Home on Gender Attitudes and Household Production,"22-E-2, Bank of Japan.","One of the more substantial changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic has been the work from home (WfH) movement. However, as countries now prepare to move beyond the pandemic, the longevity of WfH remains unclear, as it involves not only the operations of businesses but of households as well. A further question is whether this pandemic-induced behavioral change might lead to more long-lasting societal effects such as a shift in gender norms. This study draws on an original panel survey dataset in Japan covering the periods before and after the onset of the pandemic to explore how engagement in WfH affects a couple's allocation of household production, work hours, and attitudes toward traditional gender norms. We find that husbands who adopt WfH increase their share of household production and also form more gender-neutral views of traditional gender roles. We also discuss the potential impact of this shift in gender attitudes on the future of WfH and the labor market."

First, focusing on the possibility that the number of customers in service industries can be estimated using mobility data, we develop indicators to capture economic activity in amusement parks, shopping centers, and food services. We show that using GPS mobility data, it is possible to nowcast economic activity in the service industries, in real time, with a high level of precision---something which conventional statistics are largely unable to assist. In addition, by using statistical methods such as clustering, we can construct an indicator with even better nowcasting performance. Second, in the manufacturing sector we identify the locations of relatively large factories using panel data from the Economic Census for Business Activity and by utilizing hourly and daily mobility patterns such as a daytime ratio. We then construct indicators for nowcasting production based on the population in the specified areas. We find that we can nowcast production with a high level of precision for some labor-intensive industries including the transportation equipment and production machinery industries. These results suggest that mobility data are a useful tool for nowcasting macroeconomic activity in a timely manner."

Developments in these market-based systemic risk measures suggest that the reforms have led to a larger decline in the systemic risk contribution of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) than of other banks. The systemic risk measures also suggest that the larger the systemic risk associated with a G-SIB, the more the reforms have led to a decline in its systemic risk. These findings are consistent with the objectives of the reforms and are validated by statistical analyses, including quantile panel regressions. We also highlight the importance of using data for a subset of financial institutions to adjust for the increase in data coverage when using popular estimates of SRISK. Furthermore, SRISK may overestimate systemic risk in recent years by ignoring the role of total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC)-eligible bonds."

What has driven the TFP down, however, remains a puzzle. To address this question, we develop a New Keynesian sticky price model that is designed to investigate two suspects behind the TFP slowdown other than regression of technology; (i) malfunction of financial intermediation, and (ii) inter- and intra-sectoral misallocation of resources. Namely, our model consists of two goods producing sectors and financial intermediation and non-technology shocks endogenously alter the observed TFP through these channels. We use an estimated model based on the data from the 1980s to the 2010s to demonstrate that exogenous deteriorations of balance sheets of financial intermediaries and firms contributed a sizable portion of TFP decline by hampering financial intermediation. We also show that such shocks play the dominant role in generating persistent deflation during the lost decades.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"
