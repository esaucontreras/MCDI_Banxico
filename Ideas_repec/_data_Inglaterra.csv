 """,2025.,Modelling income risk dynamics in the UK: a parametric approach,"1129, Bank of England.","This paper uses rich, administrative-quality data on earnings in the UK from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) to provide a detailed analysis of income risk and its patterns across individuals and over time. We develop a model of income dynamics that accounts for the broader state of the economy and successfully captures key features of the UK earnings growth distribution, including: a cyclical variance, procyclical skewness (more frequent negative earnings shocks during recessions), and a distribution that combines sharp peaks with long, heavy tails. The model is simple enough to be integrated into broader macroeconomic frameworks, such as heterogeneous agent models, and could be used to support policy scenario analysis."

 """,2025.,The positive neutral countercyclical capital buffer,"1128, Bank of England.","We reconcile theory and recent evidence on the benefits of building releasable bank capital buffers when there is headroom for doing so by building a quantitative macro-banking model that provides a rationale for static bank capital requirements and dynamic capital buffers due to externalities arising from bank risk failure and collateral constraints. Optimal dynamic capital buffers gradually build in response to expected upward shifts in bank net interest margins. In the absence of pecuniary externalities due to collateral constraints, such capital buffers are ineffective. The model also captures previous empirical findings such as the negative effect of a capital requirement tightening on short-term lending and the optimality of setting static bank capital requirements at relatively conservative levels. We present an application of our quantitative analysis in the form of a simple framework for calibrating the so-called ‘positive neutral counter-cyclical capital buffer’ (PN-CCyB)."

 """,2025.,Improving text classification: logistic regression makes small LLMs strong and explainable ‘tens-of-shot’ classifiers,"1127, Bank of England.","Text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis are common in economics and finance. We demonstrate that smaller, local generative language models can be effectively used for these tasks. Compared to large commercial models, they offer key advantages in privacy, availability, cost, and explainability. We use 17 sentence classification tasks (each with 2 to 4 classes) to show that penalised logistic regression on embeddings from a small language model often matches or exceeds the performance of a large model, even when trained on just dozens of labelled examples per class – the same amount typically needed to validate a large model’s performance. Moreover, this embedding-based approach yields stable and interpretable explanations for classification decisions."

 """,2025.,Investors as a liquidity backstop in corporate bond markets,"1126, Bank of England.","Investors act as a liquidity backstop in the corporate bond market. By providing liquidity, investors help ease dealers’ balance sheet constraints, especially during market stress. During the March 2020 Dash-for-Cash, in bonds where investors stopped providing liquidity, transaction costs rose by 38%. We find the composition of types of liquidity providers – rather than just their presence – shapes trading costs. Dealers relying on flexible-mandate investors, such as hedge funds, are more resilient to liquidity shocks. Dealers offer discounts to investors for past liquidity services to maintain liquidity provider networks. These discounts represent two thirds of relationship discounts."

 """,2025.,Food prices matter most: sensitive household inflation expectations,"1125, Bank of England.","We construct a novel data set to investigate the sensitivity of household inflation expectations to personal experienced inflation, testing whether households weigh price changes differently across items in the consumption basket. Across households of all age, income, gender, work status, UK region, and house tenure groups, food prices matter significantly more for inflation expectations dynamics than other components, including energy. In particular, households’ expectations are sensitive to changes in food price-driven inflation at short, medium and long horizons, and this association is persistent, non-linear and asymmetric. Our results imply that the risk of household expectations contributing to persistent inflationary dynamics are greatest following large and inflationary shocks to, specifically, food prices. Moreover, our findings can rationalise a number of empirical regularities related to household expectations: their upwards bias relative to actual inflation; cross-sectional heterogeneity across demographic groups; and their ‘supply-side’ oriented view of the economy."

 """,2025.,It is all about demand and supply: a dualistic view of the euro area business cycle,"1124, Bank of England.","What drives business cycle fluctuations in the euro area (EA)? To answer this question, we build a rich, high-dimensional dataset of quarterly time series covering both EA aggregates and its major member countries. We find that just two shocks account for the bulk of the EA’s cyclical dynamics, and that they map cleanly onto standard demand and supply disturbances, consistent with textbook macroeconomic theory. Beyond this aggregate result, we uncover a high degree of synchronization in how member states respond to these shocks, highlighting the presence of a shared underlying cycle across the region. We also provide a historical decomposition of key EA macro variables based on the identified demand and supply components, with a particular focus on the recent inflation surge. Our findings show that supply-side factors dominated the initial phase of inflation through mid-2022, while demand-side pressures intensified and became increasingly important from mid-2022 onward."

 """,2025.,Relationship lending and monetary policy pass-through,"1123, Bank of England.","This paper investigates the link between bank‑firm lending relationships and monetary policy pass‑through, focusing on episodes of low interest rates. Using administrative tax and bank supervisory data ranging from 1997 to 2019, we track the entirety of bank‑firm relationships in Norway. Our analysis shows that when the central bank’s policy rate is relatively low, firms that have maintained a long‑term relationship with their bank experience a lower pass‑through of further policy rate cuts. Specifically, we find that when the policy rate is around 1%, each additional year of relationship decreases the pass‑through of a rate cut by 2.7 percentage points. We propose a theoretical model to rationalise our empirical findings, where state‑dependent differential pass‑through results from the presence of firms’ switching costs and banks’ leverage constraint. The model highlights that the composition of relationship lengths in the economy matters for aggregate monetary policy pass‑through. The proportion of long‑term relationships in the Norwegian economy significantly increased after the global financial crisis. Using the model, we calculate a counterfactual aggregate pass‑through for 2017, a period of monetary easing in a low‑rate environment, assuming this proportion had remained at its pre‑crisis level."

 """,2025.,Agent-based modeling at central banks: recent developments and new challenges,"1122, Bank of England.","Over the past decade, agent-based models (ABMs) have been increasingly employed as analytical tools within economic policy institutions. This paper documents this trend by surveying the ABM-relevant research and policy outputs of central banks and other related economic policy institutions. We classify these studies and reports into three main categories: (i) applied research connected to the mandates of central banks, (ii) technical and methodological research supporting the advancement of ABMs; and (iii) examples of the integration of ABMs into policy work. Our findings indicate that ABMs have emerged as effective complementary tools for central banks in carrying out their responsibilities, especially after the extension of their mandates following the global financial crisis of 2007–09. While acknowledging that room for improvement remains, we argue that integrating ABMs into the analytical frameworks of central banks can support more effective policy responses to both existing and emerging economic challenges, including financial innovation and climate change."

 """,2025.,Do portfolio companies learn from their peers? Evidence from venture capital funding,"1121, Bank of England.","We investigate the impact of ‘learning from peers’ on the fundraising abilities of start-up companies. Employing data on the financing rounds of privately owned portfolio companies, we find that companies observe the round amounts of their most successful peers and learn to negotiate higher round amounts with venture capital investors. We further show that the number of common directors or venture capital firms between portfolio companies and their most successful peers has a positive impact on the round amounts of these portfolio companies, which supports the existence of conversational learning. Moreover, observational learning from peers is higher in hot markets, where investors rely on less costly information on peers. Our findings confirm that both observational and conversational learning allow portfolio companies to be in a better negotiating position, thus enhancing their ability to secure funding and invest in their growth."

 """,2025.,Weathering the storm: sectoral economic and inflationary effects of floods and the role of adaptation,"1120, Bank of England.","This paper investigates the impact of floods on economic output and prices at the sectoral level for local authorities in England using highly granular climate and economic data. We use precipitation z-scores as an instrument for floods to deal with endogeneity stemming from adaptation capital and we obtain dynamic impulse responses to the shock on GDP and inflation with a local projection approach (LP-IV). We find significant heterogeneities across sectors in terms of size, timing and sign, with sectoral output (prices) declining (increasing) up to 20% (250 basis points) following an increase in the number of floods. This evidence explains well the response of aggregate GDP and inflation found in the literature. Our estimates suggest that reduced investment can only partially explain the decline in output, and only in manufacturing. The response of the number and value of real estate market transactions is instead consistent with a wealth effect that is line with the demand side behaviour in wholesale and retail trade. To shed more light on the interaction among sectors, we use input-output tables and show that flood shocks propagate through the production network. Finally, using local authority expenditure on flood defences and a proxy for adaptation capital, we find that investments in adaptation strongly reduce the likelihood of flooding, but are less effective at mitigating economic damages once a flood hits. Our analysis highlights the importance of disentangling the economic impact of climate change at the sectoral level and the need for adaptation investments."

 """,2025.,Insurers monitor shocks to collateral: micro evidence from mortgage‑backed securities,"1119, Bank of England.","This paper examines how insurance companies monitor and react to cash‑flow shocks in commercial mortgage‑backed securities (CMBS). Using detailed micro data around the onset of the Covid pandemic, we show that lease expiration predicts commercial real estate mortgage delinquency, particularly for offices due to lower demand. Insurers monitor these risks and sell more exposed CMBS – mirrored by a surge in small banks holding CMBS. This monitoring effort also affects insurers’ trading in other assets, indicating limited risk assessment capacity. Our findings reveal that institutional investors actively monitor underlying asset risk and can even gain informational advantages over some banks."

 """,2025.,Geopolitical risk shocks: when size matters,"1118, Bank of England.","In this paper, we investigate the economic effects of geopolitical risk (GPR) shocks, with a focus on non‑linear transmission mechanisms. Using a VARX framework, we show that larger positive shocks have a disproportionately greater impact, pointing to the existence of an amplification channel driven by rising uncertainty. Large GPR shocks trigger precautionary behaviours, leading to sharp declines in consumption and equity prices. In contrast, prices react positively but the responses are overall muted due to offsetting forces from reduced demand and heightened uncertainty. We further show that GPR shocks linked to anticipated geopolitical threats exhibit pronounced non‑linearities, significantly increasing oil prices and inflation expectations, thereby exerting upward pressure on domestic prices."

 """,2025.,Monetary policy along the yield curve: why can central banks affect long-term real rates?,"1117, Bank of England.","This paper presents theory and evidence to advance the notion that very persistent policy‑induced interest rate changes may have only weak effects on activity. This arises when consumption‑savings decisions are not primarily driven by intertemporal substitution, but also by life‑cycle forces. The small impact of persistent rate changes results when intertemporal substitution and asset valuation effects are offset by interest income effects, which affect asset demand. In our framework, knowing the exact location of r* becomes less critical to central banks, as interest rates can be kept away from this level for prolonged periods of time, allowing monetary policy to unconsciously drive trends in real rates. This perspective offers an explanation to a set of puzzles, including why long‑term real rates often move quite closely with short‑term policy rates."

 """,2025.,Local Projections vs. VARs for structural parameter estimation,"1116, Bank of England.","This paper conducts a Monte Carlo study to examine the small sample performance of impulse response (IRF) matching and Indirect Inference estimators that target IRFs that have been estimated with Local Projections (LP) or Vector Autoregressions (VAR). The analysis considers various identification schemes for the shocks and several variants of LP and VAR estimators. Results show that the lower bias from LP responses is a big advantage when it comes to IRF matching, while the lower variance from VAR is desirable for Indirect Inference applications as it is robust to the higher bias of VAR-IRFs. Overall, I recommend the use of Indirect Inference over IRF matching when estimating Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models as the former is robust to potential misspecification coming from invalid identification assumptions, small sample issues or incorrect lag selection."

 """,2025.,Monetary transmission through the housing sector,"1115, Bank of England.","The simultaneous rise in housing rents and interest rates over 2022–24 brought scrutiny to the interaction between monetary policy and the housing market. We start by providing evidence on this interaction using data from the United Kingdom and a high frequency identification. Our main empirical finding is that house prices and rents do not move together after an increase in interest rates. House prices fall strongly but gradually, reaching their trough after one year, while nominal rents are stable for one to two years, before eventually falling. Next, we develop a quantitative Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian model that includes housing and rental sectors. In particular, we model individual landlords as the marginal providers of rental housing. We use the model to examine the housing channel of monetary policy where we find: (1) the housing channel is large and falls disproportionality on mortgagors; (2) deviations from rational expectations mean landlords largely fail to pass on mortgage costs and act more like wealthy hand to mouth; (3) these behavioural biases dampen the potential trade-off between prices and output induced by the rental market; and (4) that it may be optimal for monetary policy makers to look through and accommodate housing supply shocks."

 """,2025.,"Liquidity, monetary policy and the commodity futures market","1114, Bank of England.","This paper explores a novel directional liquidity-based transmission channel of monetary policy, which explains the heterogeneity in the response of commodity future prices to monetary policy. Employing an event-study analysis with a high-frequency instrumental variable estimator, we find that the trading volume of our sample of commodity futures declines following FOMC announcements. Further, we find that more traded commodities are also more exposed to monetary policy surprises, suggesting a significant role for trading activity in the transmission of monetary policy shocks to commodity markets. Lastly, we show that the direction of the target rate change matters to this transmission mechanism of monetary policy."

 """,2025.,"Dealers, information and liquidity provision in safe assets","1113, Bank of England.","In this paper, we empirically study the role of information in safe asset liquidity crises, using the 2022 UK LDI crisis as a laboratory. Contrary to traditional adverse selection models, which predict higher liquidity costs due to the presence of informed traders, we find that dealers initially reduce liquidity costs for informed investors, and subsequently raise costs and reduce liquidity for the broader market. We interpret this as evidence of dealers seeking to learn from informed investors and then restricting liquidity as they process this information. We also document that dealers exploit their informational advantage in anonymous interdealer markets and that similar dynamics are present in other crises. These patterns reverse when central bank interventions restore market liquidity, thereby mitigating the effects of dealers’ information chasing and their liquidity reallocation."

 """,2025.,Bouncing back: how mothballing curbs prices,"1112, Bank of England.","We investigate the macroeconomic impacts of mothballed businesses – those that closed temporarily – on sectoral equilibrium prices after a negative demand shock. First, we introduce a new establishment-level data set derived from Google Places. We confirm the importance of temporary closures during the Covid-19 pandemic. Data on establishment reviews also suggests that preventing productive businesses from permanently exiting could support employment. Second, we embed these findings into a model of heterogeneous firm dynamics. By maintaining productive capacity during downturns, temporary closures initially support employment and subsequently reduce price pressures. Our results suggest that pandemic fiscal support for temporary closures may have eased inflationary pressures."

 """,2025.,The anatomy of a shock to residential real estate: the role of lending,"1111, Bank of England.","What is the role of lending in transmitting shocks to residential real estate? We consider this question by examining an adverse and salient shock to a segment of the property market in England and Wales. This shock, arising from a tragic event which resulted in significant loss of life, affected high-rise properties.1 Using comprehensive administrative data on all residential mortgage and property transactions, combined with property‑level rent data, we study responses in these markets. Consistent with the idea of credit being a ‘financial accelerator’, we document a decline in mortgage originations following the shock, with the sharpest contraction observed among first‑time buyers. We also highlight the role of cash buyers and lender size in dampening the overall impact of the shock. Additionally, the paper provides a conceptual framework that integrates multiple administrative data sets to understand how salient shocks, including those related to climate risks, may affect the property market. It offers valuable insights for financial policymakers on how these shocks propagate through credit and housing markets."

 """,2025.,The Bank of England’s statutory monetary policy objectives: a historical and legal account,"1110, Bank of England.","The Bank’s monetary policy objectives are among the most significant statutory objectives bestowed by Parliament on any UK public authority. The objectives make the Bank responsible for maintaining price stability and, subject to that, for supporting the government’s economic policy, including its objectives for growth and employment. When granted in 1998, the objectives were a watershed moment in the three centuries‑old history of an institution that had long‑resisted having its role prescribed or, as Bank officials at the time saw it, constrained by, law. Yet the Bank quickly embraced the benefits of having greater clarity in its legal mandate, and the objectives have proved remarkably resilient in directing the Bank’s monetary response over the past 25 years. This paper offers an in‑depth historical and legal account of the Bank’s statutory monetary policy objectives; it explores the relevant statutory provisions in the Bank of England Act 1998 and the debates that surrounded their drafting, as well as their application and interpretation in practice."

An empirical analysis for the United Kingdom,"1109, Bank of England.","This paper studies how monetary policy impacts inflation expectations in the United Kingdom. Using higher moments of the distribution of inflation expectations, I construct a summary measure of expectations for households, firms, professional forecasters and financial markets. In a Bayesian VAR identified using a high frequency-identified monetary policy shock series, I find that a monetary policy tightening causes significant variation in the response of inflation expectations across groups: firms’ and financial market median expectations fall, while households’ inflation expectations rise. I document that monetary policy decisions act as a stabilisation mechanism by reducing the dispersion of expectations 12–18 months following a shock."

 """,2025.,QT versus QE: who is in when the central bank is out?,"1108, Bank of England.","We analyse the role of preferred habitat (PH) demand in the transmission of quantitative tightening (QT) and quantitative easing (QE) programmes. For this, we combine granular data from Bank of England QT and QE auctions with secondary market bond level transaction data. We find that when dealers traded on behalf of pension funds and insurance companies, their bidding at QE auctions was less elastic, in line with PH demand theory. In contrast, during QT auctions, there is no evidence of significant PH demand pressures. To account for the observed asymmetric demand effects during QE and QT, we build on and extend the constant elasticity demand model by Vayanos and Vila (2021), so that the PH demand elasticity can depend on available bond supply. We show that the decreased role of the PH demand channel during QT is consistent with the increased government bond issuance post the Covid-19 pandemic."

 """,2025.,How curvy is the Phillips curve?,"1107, Bank of England.","Macro data suggest a convex relationship between inflation and economic slack, but identifying causality in this setting is challenging. Using data from large panel surveys of UK and US firms we show that the response of prices to demand shocks is also convex at the firm level. We obtain similar results using three different empirical exercises examining: the impact of Covid demand shocks, the response to sales shocks, and hypothetical shocks from a survey question. This convexity is strongest in firms and industries with higher inflation, disappears in horizons beyond two years, and is also present in response to cost shocks. We rationalise these findings in a menu cost model with positive trend inflation and decreasing returns at the firm level, which replicates firm and aggregate Phillips curve convexity. The non‑linearity emerges from trend inflation pushing firms closer to their price increase thresholds."

 """,2025.,The effect of mortgage brokers on banks’ business models,"1104, Bank of England.","We study the effects intermediaries have on the UK mortgage market by exploiting the strong increase in broker intermediation between 2013 and 2020. Our findings indicate that this rise coincided with more households choosing mortgages with a short fixed term, due to brokers steering households towards these mortgages to increase fees from repeat business. Increased broker intermediation also enabled smaller lenders to reach more customers by geographically diversifying their mortgage portfolios, which gave smaller lenders the opportunity to specialise their mortgage portfolios, concentrating on long fixed-term and high LTV mortgages."

 """,2024.,Monetary policy and sentiment-driven fluctuations,"1106, Bank of England.","Sentiments, or beliefs about aggregate demand, can be self-fulfilling in models departing slightly from the complete information benchmark in the New Keynesian framework. Through its effect on aggregate variables, the policy stance determines the degree of complementarity in firms’ production (pricing) decisions and consequently, the precision of endogenous signals that firms receive. As a result, aggregate fluctuations can be driven by both fundamental and non-fundamental shocks. The distribution of non-fundamental shocks is endogenous to policy, introducing a novel trade-off between stabilising output and inflation. Both strong inflation targeting and nominal flexibilities increase the variance of non-fundamental shocks, which are shown to be suboptimal. Moreover, the Taylor principle is no longer sufficient to rule out indeterminacy. Instead, an interest rate rule that places sufficiently low weight on inflation eliminates non-fundamental volatility and thereby the output-inflation trade-off."

 """,2024.,When refinancing meets monetary tightening: heterogeneous impacts on spending and debt via mortgage modifications,"1105, Bank of England.","This study examines how UK mortgagors adjusted their spending and saving habits in response to the post-2021 monetary tightening, highlighting the interplay between collateral‑driven borrowing and the cash-flow channel of monetary policy. Unlike in markets with long-term fixed-rate mortgages, UK mortgagors face heightened exposure to interes rate shifts due to periodic refinancing requirements. By combining transaction-level data from a financial app with loan-level records, we create a detailed and representative view of UK mortgagors’ monthly balance sheets from 2021 to 2023. This allows us to explore how mortgage modifications – particularly equity extraction and term extensions – shapes household responses to rising borrowing costs. Our findings reveal stark heterogeneity: households leveraging equity extraction, enabled by nominal house price appreciation, offset higher mortgage payments and maintain or increase discretionary spending while reducing unsecured debts. Conversely, households unable or unwilling to adjust loans face significant spending cuts in response to higher rates. These results suggest that collateral-driven debt, amplified by rising property values and mortgage term extensions, can partially compensate for the cash-flow channel in driving consumption and financial behaviour during tightening cycles. This highlights the dual role of loan modifications: while mitigating immediate consumption declines, they may affect monetary policy transmission for some groups and contribute to more persistent borrowing."

Based on firm‑level net currency derivatives exposures, we find that UK and EU pension funds, investment funds, insurers, and non‑financial corporations use FX derivatives primarily for hedging purposes, with dealer banks accommodating these clients’ hedging needs. In contrast, hedge funds predominantly utilise FX derivatives to speculate, with their trading activity consistent with carry trade, momentum, and macroeconomic news investment strategies. Lastly, the paper documents many novel facts that should motivate theoretical models."

 """,2024.,Forbearance lending as a crisis management tool: evidence from Japan,"1102, Bank of England.","Credit market interventions have become a widespread policy tool deployed by governments around the world to support their corporate sectors following shocks like the global financial crisis and the pandemic. Among those policies, forbearance programmes allowed firms to temporarily stop making payments on certain debt obligations or obtain debt forgiveness. However, the impact of these policies is not fully understood. In particular, forbearance lending is generally believed to keep unviable firms alive and contribute to the zombification of the corporate sector. To inform this debate, we examine the effects of Japan’s small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Financing Facilitation Act, which encouraged banks to offer loan forbearance to troubled SMEs. We develop a framework to quantify the aggregate impact of the policy using a difference-in-differences approach combined with back‑of‑the‑envelope counterfactual exercises. Our evaluation indicates that, when coupled with business restructuring plans, forbearance lending can temporarily boost output without contributing to the widespread zombification of the corporate sector. Forbearance is more effective when credit market disruptions impede the reallocation of capital."

Motivated by the decline in transactional cash usage and the increase in online sales in the UK, this paper provides a theoretical framework to study the underlying drivers of these trends and the welfare implications of introducing an unremunerated retail CBDC. I develop a cash credit model with physical and digital retail sectors, endogenous entry of firms and directed consumer search. Calibrating to UK data between 2010 and 2022 the model suggests that there are positive welfare gains from introducing an unremunerated retail CBDC, but these have likely declined over time."

This paper provides new evidence on US non-financial firms and a novel non-parametric framework based on random forests. The key advantage of the methodology is that it does not impose any assumptions on how the effect of shocks varies across firms thereby allowing for general forms of heterogeneity in the transmission of shocks. My estimates suggest that there exists a threshold in the level of firm risk above which monetary policy is much less effective. Additionally, there is no evidence that the effect of policy varies with firm risk for the 75% of firms in the sample with higher risk. The proposed methodology is a generalisation of local projections and nests several common local projection specifications, including linear and nonlinear."

Using administrative data for Germany from 1997–2016, we identify mass layoffs and estimate the trajectory of earnings and employment of observationally similar migrants and natives displaced from the same establishment. Despite similar pre-layoff careers, migrants lose an additional 9% of their earnings in the first five years after displacement. This gap arises from both lower re-employment probabilities and post-layoff wages and is not driven by selective return migration. Key mechanisms include sorting into lower-quality firms and depending on lower-quality coworker networks during job search."

We show that competitive deregulation will not arise if the relatively growth-focused regulator becomes even more growth focused, but it becomes more likely if the relatively stability-focused regulator becomes more growth focused. We also demonstrate that domestic nonregulatory inducements to retain banks (eg tax, labour laws) create an externality on the global equilibrium of regulatory stringency chosen by financial regulators with a growth objective."

Based on these estimates, a fully unanticipated announcement that mimics the Bank’s first annual QT programme would raise 10-year yields by 20 basis points under low market stress, with the impact from passive unwind broadly equivalent to that from active sales."

Over half of firms expect climate change to have a positive impact on their investment in the medium term, with around a quarter expecting a large impact of over 10%. Around two thirds of these investments are expected to be in addition to normal capital expenditure, with some firms investing less elsewhere. Climate investments are expected mainly in switching to green energy sources and improving energy efficiency, and firms expect to finance these mainly using internal cash reserves. Climate investment will be driven by larger firms as well as those in more energy‑intensive sectors. Although firms are expecting to invest more resources in adapting to climate change, under reasonable assumptions, these investments are still not sufficient to meet the estimated targets implied by the UK Net Zero Pathway."

Over 60% of households report that their inflation perceptions are heavily influenced by food prices and display a stronger association between their inflation expectations and perceptions. We complement this finding with a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) analysis, illustrating that food price shocks have a larger and more persistent effect on expectations compared to a ‘representative’ inflation shock.

While monetary policy easing shocks compress credit spreads more for higher-EBP (riskier) firms, lower-EBP firms’ investment responds more. Further, credit supply shocks replicate monetary policy’s heterogeneous effects, whereas credit demand shocks elicit homogeneous firm responses. A model with financial frictions in which lower-EBP firms have flatter marginal benefit curves for capital rationalises firms’ price and quantity reactions to these three shocks. In contrast, previously examined channels, while complementary, are inconsistent with our more comprehensive set of empirical moments."

Further, we examine the role of direct versus indirect, and foreign versus domestic, channels in transmitting these shocks. Results indicate that tariffs and conflicts impact the composition of gross production by changing its intermediate input component, and these changes are driven predominantly by indirect and foreign channels. Trade protectionism in high‑income countries dampens low‑income countries’ global supply chain (GSC) network participation, but not that of middle‑income countries. Further, it increases their domestic input contribution to output, at the expense of developing nations. On the other hand, trade liberalisation in low and low‑middle‑income countries increases their level of GSC involvement, with the adjustment taking place in high‑income countries through an increase in their use of foreign intermediates."

 """,2024.,"Reallocation, productivity, and monetary policy in an energy crisis","1091, Bank of England.","This paper introduces a New Keynesian multi-sector industry model that integrates firm heterogeneity, entry, and exit dynamics, while considering energy production from both fossil fuels and renewables. We investigate the effects of a sustained increase in fossil fuel prices on sectoral size, labour productivity, and inflation. A hike in the price of fossil resources results in higher energy prices. Due to ex-ante heterogeneity in energy intensity in production, the profitability of sectors is impacted asymmetrically. As production costs rise, less efficient firms leave the market, while new entrants must display higher idiosyncratic productivity. While this process enhances average labour productivity, it also results in a lasting decrease in the entry of new firms. A central bank with a strong anti-inflationary stance can circumvent the energy price increase and mitigate its inflationary effects by curbing rising production costs. This policy entails a higher impact cost in terms of output and lower average productivity, but leads to a faster recovery in business dynamism. Thus, our results suggest that monetary policy faces a trade-off between stabilising aggregate activity and business dynamism."

Because banks disburse loans through deposit creation, they never face financing risks (being unable to fund new loans), only refinancing risks (being unable to settle net deposit withdrawals in reserves). Permanent quantitative tightening, while reducing the equilibrium real interest rate, has significant negative effects on financial and real variables, by increasing the cost at which reserves-scarce parts of the banking sector create money. Temporary net deposit withdrawals, which affect the funding cost and loan extension of one part of the banking sector at the expense of another part, have highly asymmetric financial and real effects. The quantity and distribution of central bank reserves, and the extent of frictions in the interbank and reserves markets, critically affect the size of these effects, and can matter even in a regime of ample aggregate reserves. Countercyclical reserve injections can help to smooth the business cycle. We find that countercyclical reserve quantity rules can make sizeable contributions to welfare that can reach a similar size to the Taylor rule."

Balance sheet segmentation and operational issues slowed equity injections into LDIs by well‑capitalised pension investors, leading LDIs to instead sell gilts. This effect was most pronounced for pooled LDIs, which invest on behalf of multiple pension schemes, because of co‑ordination problems between pensions.

The transmission of GDP fluctuations also differs across the income distribution. Changes to hours worked and employment explain the majority of the labour earnings response in the bottom half of the distribution, whereas changes to the hourly wage are more important in the top half. In a further decomposition, we show that the changes to employment are largely due to fluctuations in the employment to unemployment transition rate.

Our approach enables us to distil the contribution of initial economic shocks and the feedback and amplification mechanisms to extreme tail events. Overall, we find that, since the Covid pandemic (2020–21), the UK financial system has experienced an improvement in both profit expectations and tail losses. Comparing sectoral losses in an extreme stress scenario, we find that insurers are more affected than banks by economic credit and traded risk losses, while fire sale losses affect banks more than insurers."

For a general set of estimators, we show that this two-step ‘shock-first’ approach can be problematic for identification and inference relative to a one-step procedure which simply adds appropriate controls directly in the outcome regression. We show this analytically by comparing one and two-step estimators without assumptions on underlying data-generating processes. In simple ordinary least squares (OLS) settings, the two approaches yield identical coefficients, but two-step inference is unnecessarily conservative. More generally, one and two-step estimates can differ due to omitted-variable bias in the latter when additional controls are included in the second stage or when employing non-OLS estimators. In monetary-policy applications controlling for central-bank information, one-step estimates indicate that the (dis)inflationary consequences of US monetary policy are more robust than previously realised, not subject to a ‘price puzzle’."

Regarding the effects of monetary policy, our results point to transmission via inflation expectations possibly having played a bigger role than attributed to it in the forecast. We also provide a more classical evaluation of forecast errors – finding inflation forecasts to have been unbiased.

Following the 2016 depreciation of the pound, the share of non‑EU UK exports invoiced in the UK domestic currency decreased sharply by more than 20 percentage points. This was mirrored by an increase of similar magnitude in the share of US dollar invoicing, which by 2019 overtook the pound as the main non‑EU export invoicing currency. Relying on transaction‑level data on the universe of UK trade and employing shift‑share and event‑study identification strategies, we show that large foreign‑exchange movements can generate an aggregate transition in invoicing choices. This is driven by firms with low levels of operational hedging, that is whose exports are not denominated in the same currency as their import. We find that this currency‑mismatch valuation channel accounts for most of the transition to dollar pricing, above and beyond effects from strategic complementarities and market power. Finally, we show that such a shift in export pricing has important aggregate consequences for export pass‑through and the allocative effects of price rigidities: a US$ appreciation depresses demand for UK exports by twice as much than before this ‘dominant currency pricing transition’."

We focus on LASH risk relating to interest rate movements. Our framework implies that institutions with longer duration liabilities than assets – eg pension funds and insurers – take more LASH risk as interest rates fall, because solvency concerns rise in a low rate environment. Using UK regulatory data from 2019–22 on the universe of sterling repo and swap transactions, we measure, in real time and at the institution level, LASH risk for the non‑bank sector. We find that at peak LASH risk, a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have led to liquidity needs close to the cash holdings of the pension fund and insurance sector. Using a cross‑sectional identification strategy, we find that low interest rates caused increases in LASH risk. We then find that the pre‑crisis LASH risk of non‑banks predicts their bond sales during the September 2022 LDI crisis, contributing to the yield spike in the bond market."

We then build a model with heterogeneous firms in which exporters need to access external finance to export, in line with the evidence, and parameterise it to UK data. We use rich firm level data to inform the calibration of the financial costs facing exporting firms, and estimate the shock processes in our model with Bayesian methods. Our estimations show that global shocks to the financial costs of exporting are the main driver of UK export dynamics over the business cycle, alongside shocks to productivity.

Moreover, we find that global shocks to the financial costs of exporting played a crucial role in explaining the fall in UK exports in the early stages of the Global Trade Collapse, and slowed the recovery."

The effects of a ban on household consumption of petrol or gas depend crucially on the elasticity of substitution between different energy sources in consumption. For very low elasticities of substitution, a ban on petrol or gas usage also led households to cut down on their use of electricity, whereas for larger elasticities of substitution, households switched into electricity. Regardless of the elasticity of substitution, aggregate consumption fell on impact in response to the bans before rising over time. GDP and the gross output of non‑energy fall in response to both a carbon tax and a ban on petrol or gas consumption by households.

For the conventional model, I develop new identifying conditions which allow for risk aversion. I find that the degree of risk aversion required for truthful bidding to be approximately optimal is consistent with that found in studies that are the most similar to my setting. Second, the optimal strategy can be complicated.

When used for credit, OB promotes entry and competition by reducing adverse selection, but higher prices for costlier or privacy-conscious consumers partially offset these benefits"

A common factor based on macroeconomic data and survey variables has predictive ability above and beyond yield based factors for negative changes in expected rates during an easing cycle, but not for increases in expected rates during a tightening in monetary policy. At the same time, macroeconomic information does not have any asymmetric effect on the conditional distribution of term premia. We complement previous findings on the asymmetric predictability of expected rates by showing that monetary policy easing during crises is predictable. This is also relevant for policymakers, as the yield curve does not always provide an accurate picture of the expected future stance of monetary policy at turning points."

Peter, very sadly, passed away last year. The paper was written before the Global Financial Crisis and considers in detail the main techniques for resolving large banks and containing the systemic consequences that could arise from their failure. This paper highlights a number of issues that are of crucial importance in resolving large banks, notably the need as far as possible to avoid insolvency or – if that cannot be done – liquidation, the ways in which certain activities of a large bank may be wound down while those bank functions of systemic importance are preserved, and finally the trade-off between preserving financial stability on the one hand and limiting moral hazard on the other. Peter and his team would later work closely with HM Treasury to design the emergency legislation and special powers to address the failure of Northern Rock."

We compare the behaviour of banks that received reserves injections via QE operations to other similar banks in terms of the amounts lent and pricing. We also investigate whether leverage ratio capital requirements affected the amounts of liquidity supplied by broker-dealers and the spreads they charged. We find that QE interventions can improve liquidity provision, and that their size determines how this is attained. QE can also reduce the cost of borrowing in the repo market unless it was associated with spikes in demand for liquidity. Our findings further indicate that the leverage ratio supports the provision of liquidity during stress, as it prompts banks to become less leveraged. However, the larger capital charge repo transactions attract under the leverage ratio requirement is reflected in their spreads."

Effects of bank distribution restrictions during stress,"1053, Bank of England.","At the onset of the Covid‑19 crisis, several regulatory authorities issued a recommendation or request to banks to restrict their dividend and share buyback distributions. The purpose of this action was to increase banks’ resilience by not distributing retained earnings, and help them support the real economy given their unique role in doing so. These restrictions reflected the singular circumstances brought by Covid‑19. We evaluate the impact of these restrictions on banks’ resilience, lending and investors’ required rate of return. First, using a difference‑in‑differences analysis on an international sample of European banks, we find that restricted banks increased their available Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and resilience in every quarter while the restrictions were fully in place, before gradually reducing it once they were partly lifted. Second, using a data set on the universe of UK small and medium‑sized enterprise (SME) loans issued by nine UK banking groups, we find that restricted banks increased their lending volumes on smaller non‑government guaranteed loans throughout the implementation period. Third, using the international sample of European banks, we find that the restrictions increased shareholders’ required rate of return throughout the implementation period, with the impact on the required rate of return on capital partially offset by lower debtholders’ required rate of return. The results indicate that distribution restrictions can be an effective crisis tool to increase banks’ resilience and lending capacity."

Our paper looks at three core elements of the problems: measurement of the links that expose supply chains to disruptions, the nature of the shocks that cause the disruptions, and the criteria for policy to mitigate the impact of disruptions. Utilizing global input-output data, we show that US exposure to foreign suppliers, and particularly to China, is ‘hidden’ in the sense that it is much larger than what conventional trade data suggest. However, at the macro level, exposure remains relatively modest, given that over 80% of US industrial inputs are sourced domestically. We argue that many recent shocks to supply chains have been systemic rather than idiosyncratic. Moreover, systemic shocks are likely to arise from climate change, geoeconomic tensions, and digital disruptions. Our principal conclusion is that concerns regarding supply chain disruptions, and policies to address them, should focus on individual products, rather than the whole manufacturing sector."

We explore how firms strategically manage their labor-induced operating leverage by adjusting the composition of contracts in their workforce. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, a higher labor share is associated with increased volatility in cash flows following unexpected real shocks, indicating the presence of operating leverage through labor costs. Second, firms with a greater proportion of temporary contracts exhibit lower variability in cash flows and profits. This smoothing effect is more pronounced in firms with a higher labor share attributed to the permanent workforce. We complement our analysis by examining the 2001 labor market reform that lifted restrictions on the creation of temporary contracts. Our results demonstrate that firms, following the staggered implementation of the reform, increased their utilization of temporary contracts while reducing average labor compensation. Furthermore, we find that, only among firms with an ex-ante more rigid labor cost structure and in more concentrated labor markets, the earlier transition to a more flexible workforce composition led to a sizable increase in profit margins and a decrease in the cross-sectional standard deviation of profits."

Another important motive for dealers to give discounts to relationship clients is because these clients generate the bulk of dealers’ profits. Finally, we find no evidence that extraction of information from clients’ order flow is related to relationship discounts."

We use a difference‑in‑differences (DiD) setup to compare the behaviour of UK banks subject to the leverage ratio requirements (LR banks) to otherwise similar banks (non‑LR banks). Conceptually, introducing binding leverage ratio requirements into a regulatory framework with risk-based capital requirements induces banks to reoptimise, shifting from safer to riskier assets (higher asset risk). Yet, this shift would not be one‑for‑one due to risk‑weight differences, meaning the shift would be associated with a lower level of leverage (lower insolvency risk). The interaction of these two changes determines the impact on the aggregate level of risk. Empirically, we show that LR banks did not increase asset risk, and slightly reduced leverage levels, compared to the control group after the introduction of leverage ratio in the UK. As expected, these two changes lead to a lower aggregate level of risk. Our results show that credit default swap spreads on the five‑year subordinated debt of LR banks dropped relative to non‑LR banks post leverage ratio introduction."

We consider a network of bilateral exposures between banks in which financial contagion can spread because banks incorporate the creditworthiness of their counterparties into the valuation of their assets. Ring-fencing acts as an exogenous shock that impacts the creditworthiness of banks through leverage, depending on how assets are allocated between ring-fenced and non-ring-fenced entities. We find conditions on this allocation that leads to safer ring-fenced entities and less safe non-ring-fenced entities when compared with their groups prior to the implementation of ring-fencing. We also show that ring-fencing can make both the equity of individual banking groups and the aggregate equity of the banking system decrease.

Using data from the auctions held in June 2010 to January 2014, we find that the PMA increased welfare (defined by the difference between the spreads that financial institutions were willing to pay and the spreads that the BoE was willing to accept) by approximately 50%, or 2 basis points per loan, relative to these alternatives. We would expect larger welfare gains in a less stable period than the period studied, and simulations confirm this. Broader benefits of the auctions of reducing systemic risk, while mitigating moral hazard, informing the BoE about stress in the market, and communicating the ‘correct’ price to the market, are taken into account in our approach, to the extent that the BoE’s supply curve internalises some of these externalities. We also find that the PMA always gave the BoE more (or occasionally the same) surplus and revenue relative to if one of the alternative designs had been used. However, the effect of the PMA on aggregate bidder surplus was ambiguous. The latter result may be a property of the period studied, and of the fact that there were only two sets of eligible collateral in this period."

While we estimate that the supply of dollars from abroad is price-elastic, our results suggest that UK-resident global banks’ demand for dollars is price-inelastic. Furthermore, we show that the causal effect of banking flows on exchange rates is state dependent, with effects twice as large when banks’ capital ratios are one standard deviation below average. Our findings showcase the importance of banks’ risk-bearing capacity for exchange-rate dynamics and, therefore, for insulating their domestic economies from global financial shocks."

The states reflect four possible market conditions, defined by the direction and magnitude of deviation of the prevailing FX spot rate from its long-term trends. The model’s performance is tested for five currencies against pound sterling for various horizons. Our analysis compares the hedging outcomes of the proposed model to those of other frequently used hedging approaches. The empirical results suggest that our model demonstrates the highest level of risk reduction for the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and Turkish lira and the second-best performance for the Indian rupee. The risk reduction is significantly higher for lira, which suggests that the proposed model might be able to provide much more effective hedging for highly volatile currencies. The improved performance of the model can be attributed to the adjustability of the estimation horizon for the optimal hedge ratio based on the prevailing market conditions. This, in turn, allows it to better capture fat‑tail properties frequently observed in FX returns. Our findings suggest that FX investors tend to use short-term memory (focus more on recent price movements) during low market conditions (relative to trend) and long-term memory in high ones. It would be also useful to build a better understanding of how investor behaviour depends on market conditions and mitigate the adverse behavioural implications of short-term memory, such as panic."

What are the implications for monetary policy? We develop a small, open-economy TANK model that features labour and an energy import good as complementary production inputs (Gas-TANK). Given such complementarities, higher energy prices reduce the labour share of total income. Due to borrowing constraints, this translates into a drop in aggregate demand. Higher price flexibility insures firm profits from adverse energy price shocks, further depressing labour income and demand. We illustrate how the transmission of shocks in a RANK versus a TANK depends on the degree of complementarity between energy and labour in production and the degree of price rigidities. Optimal monetary policy is less contractionary in a TANK and can even be expansionary when credit constraints are severe. Finally, the contractionary effect of an energy price shock on demand cannot be generalised to alternate supply shocks, as the specific nature of the supply shock affects how resources are redistributed in the economy."

 """,2023.,"Open banking, shadow banking and regulation","1039, Bank of England.","We argue that open banking will create diverse banking models: competitive banks (serving depositors who adopt open banking) and monopolistic banks (serving the other depositors). In equilibrium, at the margin, the profit of competitive and monopolistic banks should be equal. Hence, the system-wide impact of any policy change cannot be judged solely by the impact on a typical monopolistic or competitive bank, the impact on relative profitability also matters since this can lead banks to move from one banking type to another. For example, an increase in capital requirements bites less on the profits of competitive than monopolistic banks. Some banks thus move to the (riskier) competitive sector which we show can increase overall risk in the system. A deposit rate ceiling dampens the impact of Bertrand competition, making competitive banks more profitable, so the (riskier) competitive sector grows. Hence, rather than making the system more stable, a marginal lowering of a deposit rate ceiling can increase risk. We also show that, in many scenarios, the regulator must choose between banks funding private sector projects or all banks being safe, the regulator cannot have both. This has implications for the optimal risk weights of sovereign debt. In our model, none of these effects are driven by the presence of unregulated assets/sectors nor on impacts on charter value, as is the case in papers that find outcomes that are the opposite of what was intended. We then introduce an unregulated, shadow banking sector into the model and show that the growth in shadow banking benefits monopolistic banks relative to competitive banks. This increases the size of the (low-risk) monopolistic sector, reducing overall risk in the system. We discuss policy implications."

Our aim is twofold: first, to provide a reference guide of the state of the art for those developing such models; second, to distil insights from this endeavour for policymakers using these models. In our view, the modelling frontier faces three main challenges: (a) our understanding of the potential for amplification in sectors of the non-bank financial system during periods of stress, (b) multi-sectoral models of the non-bank financial system to analyse the behaviour of the overall demand and supply of liquidity under stress and (c) stress‑testing models that incorporate comprehensive two-way interactions between the financial system and the real economy.

Heterogeneous polluting firms purchase capital by combining their resources with loans from banks and are hit by idiosyncratic shocks that can lead them to default. We find that financial market distortions strongly affect the performance of climate policy throughout the business cycle. The welfare cost of business cycles is substantially lower under a cap-and-trade system than under a carbon tax if financial frictions are stringent, firm leverage is high, and agents are sufficiently risk-averse. The difference in welfare costs shrinks significantly in the presence of simple macroprudential policy rules that weaken the strength of financial market distortions.

We use granular positions and transactions data in interest rate swaps, covering over 60% of overall swap activity in the world. We show that pension and insurance (PF&I) sector emerges as a natural counterparty to banks and corporations: overall, and in response to decline in rates, PF&I buy duration, whereas banks and corporations sell duration. This cross-sector netting reduces the aggregate net demand that is supplied by dealers. However, two factors impede cross-sector netting and add to dealer imbalances across maturities. (i) PF&I, bank and corporate demand is segmented across maturities. (ii) Large volumes are traded by hedge funds, who behave like banks in the short end and like PF&I in the long end. This worsens segmentation, exposing dealers to a steepening or flattening of the yield curve in addition to residual duration risk. Consistent with this, we find that demand pressure, in particular hedge funds’ trades, impact swap spreads across maturities. We also document that long-tenor pension fund trades are less likely to be centrally cleared, adding counterparty credit risk to demand imbalances."

This segmentation suggests three identification strategies – sign restrictions, granular instrumental variables, and heteroskedasticity – for the demand and supply functions of each investor type. Across the three strategies, we find that (i) prices absorb new information within three days; (ii) the supply of long-horizon inflation protection is very elastic; and (iii) short-horizon price movements are unreliable measures of expected inflation as they primarily reflect liquidity shocks. Our counterfactual measure of long-horizon expected inflation in the absence of these shocks suggests that the risk of a deflation trap during the pandemic and of a persistent rise in inflation following the energy shocks were overstated, while since Autumn of 2022, expected inflation has been lower and falling more rapidly than conventional measures."

While macroprudential policy has near-zero effects on the centre of the GDP-growth distribution, we find that tighter macroprudential policy brings benefits by reducing the variance of future GDP growth, significantly and robustly boosting the left tail while simultaneously reducing the right. Assessing a range of potential channels through which these effects could materialise, we find that macroprudential policy operates through opposing tails of GDP and credit. Tighter macroprudential policy reduces the right tail of the future credit-growth distribution (both household and corporate) which, in turn, is particularly important for mitigating the left tail of GDP growth (ie, GDP-at-risk)."

 """,2023.,The potential impact of broader central clearing on dealer balance sheet capacity: a case study of UK gilt and gilt repo markets,"1026, Bank of England.","More widespread central clearing could enhance dealers’ ability to intermediate financial markets by increasing the netting of buy and sell trades, thereby reducing the impact of trading on balance sheets and capital ratios. Drawing on trade‑level regulatory data, we study the netting benefits for UK dealers if comprehensive central clearing had been introduced to the cash gilt and gilt repo markets ahead of the March 2020 dash for cash (DFC) crisis. For the gilt repo market, we estimate that the policy would have reduced the gilt repo exposures on UK dealers’ balance sheets by 40% and, hence, boosted their aggregate leverage ratio by 3 basis points. If that policy had been accompanied by standardisation of repo maturity dates, such that they fell on the same day of the week (apart from for overnight repo), the reduction in exposures would have risen to 60% and the increase in the aggregate leverage ratio to 5 basis points. Such improvements in netting rates would in principle have allowed the dealers’ repo desks to expand their trading during the DFC by 2.5 times more than under prevailing clearing rates for each incremental unit of capital available to them. For cash gilt trades, central clearing would only have reduced unsettled trade exposures for dealers using a particular accounting treatment, but would have done so by up to 80% for that group, boosting its aggregate leverage ratio by 0.4 basis points. However, changes to the computation of the Basel III leverage ratio implemented in January 2023 would also have had these effects on cash trades."

The coefficients of high‑frequency indicators are regularised via a shrinkage prior that accounts for the grouping structure and within‑group correlation among lags. A new sparsification algorithm on the posterior motivated by Bayesian decision theory derives inclusion probabilities over lag groups, thus making the results easy to communicate without imposing sparsity a priori. An empirical application on nowcasting UK GDP growth suggests that group‑shrinkage in combination with the time‑varying components substantially increases nowcasting performance by reading signals from an economically meaningful subset of indicators, whereas the time‑varying components help by allowing the model to switch between indicators. Over the data release cycle, signals initially stem from survey data and then shift towards few ‘hard’ real activity indicators. During the Covid pandemic, the model performs relatively well since it shifts towards indicators for the service and housing sectors that capture the disruptions from economic lockdowns."

Traders’ information acquisition incentives are, however, weaker in a market with longer delays. Therefore, the equilibrium fraction of informed traders is lower if delays are longer, establishing an inverse relationship between trading delays and price informativeness. We also show that risk premia and price dispersion tend to be non-monotonic functions of the level of delays when information acquisition is endogenous.

On the other hand, banks with a local presence reduce their intragroup loans, but substitute for this by increasing direct cross-border lending to non-banks. These findings suggest that increasing services trade restrictiveness may lead global banks to reshape their business model for cross-border lending. Services trade restrictions that act on the intensive margin of lending, such as barriers to competition, appear to be the primary drivers of this substitution from ‘local’ to ‘global’ financial intermediation."

We provide a detailed account of how selling pressure in gilt markets – due to deteriorating derivative and repo positions of liability-driven investors (LDI) – led to evaporating market liquidity, especially in long-dated conventional gilts and index-linked gilts. We find that firms in the LDI-pension-insurance (LDI-PI) sector who had larger repo and swap exposure before the crisis sold more gilts during the crisis (while hedge funds were compensated for providing liquidity to the LDI-PI sector). Transaction costs in bond markets quickly soared, particularly for smaller trades, for trades at smaller dealers and for trades of non-LDI-PI investors too. The aggregate dispersion of transaction prices more than doubled in a matter of days, and price dispersion across primary dealers remained significant throughout the crisis, suggestive of tightened constraints on the intermediary sector. While the episode started with the forced selling by the LDI-PI sector, our results point to large costs on other market segments as well, consistent with the contagious nature of illiquidity."

Whereas several existing studies have typically concluded that long-term unemployment is largely immaterial for price pressures, our evidence suggests that the effect of long-term unemployment on inflation is highly state dependent. In particular, reductions in long-term unemployment are found to be significantly inflationary when aggregate unemployment is low, displaying a larger and more immediate peak effect on inflation than short-term unemployment. The explanation for our finding is a direct consequence of allowing for non-linearity in the Phillips curve together with short and long-term unemployment gaps that enter the specification separately. Variation in long-term unemployment typically arises following large recessionary shocks and the Phillips curve also tends to be flatter in deep recessions. It therefore follows that the comovement between long-term unemployment and inflation will be understated in linear regressions. In order to address this, we adopt a flexible methodology that combines non-linearity and heterogeneity in the unemployment duration distribution, enabling us to control for this confounding effect of state dependence on the identification of separate Phillips-curve slopes for short and long-term unemployment. Our results would caution against underweighting long-term unemployment in the inflation-relevant measure of economic slack, especially when unemployment is low."

We focus on the interaction between the changes in LLPs' charges (the flow channel) and stocks (the stock channel) under ECL. Our results show that, when GDP growth does not demonstrate high volatility, ECL model smooths the impact of credit losses on profits and capital resources, reducing the procyclicality of capital and leverage ratios, especially under US GAAP. However, when GDP growth is highly volatile, the large differences in lifetime probabilities of defaults (PDs) between booms and busts cause sharp increases in LLPs in deep downturns, as seen for US banks during the Covid-19 crisis. Volatile GDP growth makes capital and leverage ratios more procyclical, with sharper falls in both ratios in deep downturns under US GAAP, compared to IAS 39. IFRS 9 ECL demonstrates less sensitivity to lifetime PDs fluctuations due to the existence of loan stages, and hence can reduce the procyclicality of capital and leverage ratios, even when GDP is highly volatile."

The substitution is stronger for emerging market borrowers, riskier borrowers, and borrowers in countries subject to stronger capital inflow restrictions. Results suggest that our findings are not driven by borrower‑lender matching, zombie lending, or destabilising lending. Moreover, the credit substitution has real effects, as firms with existing relationships with nonbank lenders increase total debt, investment, and employment relative to firms without such relationships.

To identify credit supply effects, we exploit data on the universe of UK mortgages, which were outside the scope of government guaranteed lending schemes. We find that more constrained banks defended their capital surpluses to a greater extent during the pandemic, and did so by maintaining higher loan rates, lower loan values, and tighter terms on riskier lending. In contrast, banks receiving greater capital relief from the cut to the UK countercyclical capital buffer during the pandemic maintained more stable capital ratios, lending provision and risk‑taking capacity.

Using administrative data from the UK, the paper finds that the choice of fixation length tracks the life-cycle decline of credit risk in the mortgage market: the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio decreases and collateral coverage improves over the life of the loan due to principal repayment and house price appreciation. High-LTV borrowers, who pay large initial credit spreads, trade off their insurance motive against reducing credit spreads over time using shorter-term contracts. To quantify demand for long-term contracts, I develop a life-cycle model of optimal mortgage fixation choice. With baseline house price growth and interest rate risk, households prefer shorter-term contracts at high LTV levels, and longer-term contracts once LTV is sufficiently low, in line with the data. The mechanism helps explain reduced and heterogeneous demand for long-term mortgage contracts."

As part of the compromise that helped to secure abolition, the British government agreed a generous compensation package of £20 million to slave-owners for the loss of their ‘property’. The Bank of England administered the payment of slavery compensation on behalf of the British government. Using records held in the Bank’s Archive, a data set of 13,500 unique transactions has been produced which details the collection of £3.4 million of compensation awarded in the form of government stock (3.5% Reduced Annuities). We shed new light on the compensation process by deploying this data set to analyse who actually held the Reduced Annuities in the books of the Bank of England, and for how long the stock was kept. While slave-owners were the main beneficiaries of the compensation process, our analysis shows that there were also other groups who gained through their roles as intermediaries. These agents sought to profit from the business opportunity presented by the moment of compensation in the mid-1830s by facilitating the collection of compensation awards on behalf of slave-owners and charging commission fees for their services. The results show that just 10 individual account names had over 8,000 transactions totalling £2.2 million. The largest agents were partners in London banks and merchant firms that had pre-existing commercial ties to the colonies that received compensation in Reduced Annuities (Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, and the Virgin Islands). Our analysis also shows that this stock was quickly sold, meaning that compensation awards made in Reduced Annuities were converted into cash. By 1844, almost none of the £3.4 million in compensation was still held as Reduced Annuities by those to whom it had been awarded, or by those who had collected it. All of this provides further evidence for the strong links between financial institutions in the City of London, the capital generated through the transatlantic slavery economy, and the compensation process during the 1830s."

We measure financial stress using a new data set on changes in credit default swap spreads for sovereigns, banks, and corporates during the Covid Shock – the period of acute financial stress in early 2020. Then we use country-sector and country-sector-time panels to assess if these different forms of financial intermediation and internationalisation tended to mitigate – or amplify – the impact of this risk-off shock. We find that banks with a higher share of funding from non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) and that were more reliant on US dollar funding were significantly more vulnerable. In contrast, whether funding was obtained in loans (instead of debt markets) or cross-border (instead of domestically) did not significantly impact resilience. The results suggest that macroprudential regulations should broaden their current focus to take into account reliance on NBFI and dollar funding, with less priority for regulations focusing on residency (ie, capital controls). Moreover, policies directly targeting these structural vulnerabilities (ie, focused on NBFIs and USD swap lines) can have significant effects even after controlling for broader macroeconomic responses and appear more successful at mitigating stress related to these funding structures than easing more generalised banking regulations."

Importantly, we find significant changes in the composition of liquidity providers: hedge funds buy a large share of the issue outside pre-MPC windows, but they shy away from liquidity provision in pre-MPC windows, being replaced by less speculative investors such as foreign government entities and pension funds.

Leveraging a granular data set of all property transactions and flooding in England, we study the effects of a reinsurance scheme which lowers insurance premiums for at-risk properties. We document that the introduction of this scheme increases prices and transaction volumes of flood-prone properties. This fully offsets the negative direct effects of flooding on property prices, with high-income areas and high-value properties benefiting relatively more.

Our contributions are fourfold. First, we show empirically that the UK’s production network has significant asymmetries in producer centrality, varies over time, and yields an empirical size-centrality relationship that tends to be positive in and outside of steady state. Second, we set up a static multisector model with a production network which allows us to link producer size and centrality to underlying shocks in the economy. We show that as long as input substitutability is less than unitary, technology shocks tend to induce negative (positive) co-movement between real output (Domar weights) and outdegrees, unlike preference shocks which tend to induce a positive size-centrality relationship. Third, we calibrate a dynamic model featuring a production network to UK data and use it to filter out technology and demand shocks. The implied size-centrality relationship from the filtered shocks confirms the intuition from the static model. Finally, we use this model to analyse the UK’s post-2010 productivity growth slowdown from a production network perspective, distinguishing industries’ accounting contributions from the contributions of industry-specific and common shocks. We find that idiosyncratic shocks to the manufacturing sector have played a key role in driving the aggregate productivity slowdown."

Inflation responded asymmetrically to movements in demand. This helps to explain why inflation did not fall much during the negative initial pandemic demand shock. Energy prices and shortages of labor and materials account for most of the rise during the rebound. Inflation rates across firms have become more dispersed and skewed since the start of the pandemic. We find that average price inflation is positively correlated with the dispersion and skewness of the distribution. Finally, we also introduce a novel measure of subjective inflation uncertainty within firms and show how this has increased during the pandemic, continuing to rise in 2022 even as sales uncertainty dropped back."

We then examine the issue empirically with data on listed firms in the UK. Our main finding is that intangibles investment are a good proxy for productivity-enhancing investment, as they have a positive effect on TFP, and in those firms that have high debt and high levels of intangibles, these effects are even more pronounced. On the other hand, we find no consistent evidence of positive TFP effects for other uses of funds, like tangible capital expenditure or dividends and equity buybacks. The effects of debt on TFP are smaller and more tenuous, but we find no evidence of a negative TFP effect of debt in firms that have high levels of intangibles intensity."

We uncover evidence of heterogeneous responses and a strong income effect on labour supply in the left tail of the income distribution, following a monetary policy shock in the US and the UK. That is, while aggregate hours and labour earnings decline, employed individuals at the bottom of the income distribution increase their hours worked in response to an interest rate hike. Moreover, their response is stronger in magnitude relative to other income groups. We rationalize this using a two-agent New-Keynesian (TANK) model where our empirical findings can be replicated with a lower intertemporal elasticity of substitution for the Hand-to-Mouth households. This setup has important implications for the impact of inequality on the transmission of monetary policy. We unveil a novel dampening effect on aggregate demand generated by the Hand-to-Mouth substitution of leisure for consumption following a negative income shock. Therefore we show that the impact of inequality on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is highly dependent on the different layers of heterogeneity on the household side and the different combinations of nominal and real frictions. More inequality does not necessarily generate a stronger response of aggregate demand after a monetary policy shock."

We label these basic, large, capital‑intensive, cash‑intensive, and high‑leverage. Second, the initial differences between these start‑up types are persistent. Third, each start‑up type displays a characteristic life cycle in terms of productivity, employment generation, and exit rates. We feed these empirical results into an agnostic firm dynamics model to quantify how much structural policy could improve macroeconomic performance by shifting the composition of start‑ups. We find that substantial gains in aggregate employment and productivity can be made through policies that benefit high‑performance start‑ups (such as large and capital‑intensive ones) while discouraging the entry of underperforming firms (such as highly leveraged ones)."

We find that universal function approximators from the machine learning literature, including gradient boosting and artificial neural networks, outperform more conventional linear models. This better performance is associated with greater flexibility, allowing the machine learning models to account for time-varying and nonlinear relationships in the data generating process. The Shapley value decomposition identifies economically meaningful nonlinearities learned by the models. Shapley regressions for statistical inference on machine learning models enable us to assess and communicate variable importance akin to conventional econometric approaches. While we also explore high-dimensional models, our findings suggest that the best trade-off between interpretability and performance of the models is achieved when a small set of variables is selected by domain experts."

This irrelevance result has the following implications. For given steady-state trade elasticities and expenditure shares, any aggregator that is homogeneous of degree one is equivalent to the Armington aggregator at first order. Similarly, aggregators that are homogeneous of arbitrary degree are equivalent to a simple generalisation of the Armington aggregator, for given steady-state trade elasticities and expenditure shares. In models with more than two countries, alternative aggregators can play a role by allowing for steady-state differences in bilateral trade elasticities across different country pairs, which the Armington aggregator rules out."

We find strong evidence overall for the role of the local supply channel in explaining gilt yield reactions both to QE announcements ('ex ante'), as well as after purchases have begun ('ex post'). The largest impact on the yield curve through local supply seems to have been in response to the initial QE1 announcements in 2009, both in terms of total impact (the impact of the announced programme), marginal impact (the impact of a given amount of purchases) and relative impact (the proportion of the total change in yields explained).

Bank capital regulation reduces the willingness of these active traders to hold assets and thus reduces liquidity. However, trader search, holdings and intermediation respond endogenously to reduce the welfare costs of regulation by 30%.

The heterogeneous nature of this model enables us to assess the effects of such experiments on the housing, rental and mortgage markets not only in the aggregate, but also at the level of individual households and sub-segments, such as first-time buyers, homeowners, buy-to-let investors, and renters. This approach can therefore offer a broad picture of the disaggregated effects of financial stability policies. The model is calibrated using a large selection of micro-data, including data from a leading UK real estate online search engine as well as loan-level regulatory data.

We find that, first, these experiments tend to mitigate the house price cycle by reducing credit availability and therefore leverage. Second, an experiment targeting a specific risk measure may also affect other risk metrics, thus necessitating a careful calibration of the policy to achieve a given reduction in risk. Third, experiments targeting the owner-occupier housing market can spill over to the rental sector, as a compositional shift in home ownership from owner-occupiers to buy-to-let investors affects both the supply of and demand for rental properties."

Dealers’ market power is more severe in the government bond market, while trading delays are more severe in the corporate bond market. We find that the welfare loss from frictions in the government and corporate bond markets are 7.8% and 12.2%, respectively, and our decomposition implies that this loss is almost exclusively caused by trading delays in the corporate bond market, while trading delays and dealers’ market power split the welfare loss equally in the government bond market.

Instead, in the rest of the markets we find a positive relationship, consistent with the dynamic trade-off theory of corporate finance, whereby firms increase their degree of financial leverage in response to profitability improvements. Not only do firms exposed to comparatively higher degree of product substitutability make less use of financial leverage, but they also rely relatively less on long-term debt. The difference is especially attributable to the period after the great financial crisis."

 """,2022.,Identification of SVAR models by combining sign restrictions with external instruments,"961, Bank of England.","We discuss combining sign restrictions with information in external instruments (proxy variables) to identify structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. In one setting, we assume the availability of valid external instruments. Sign restrictions may then be used to identify further orthogonal shocks, or as an additional piece of information to pin down the shocks identified by the external instruments more precisely. In a second setting, we assume that proxy variables are only ‘plausibly exogenous’ and suggest various types of inequality restrictions to bound the relation between structural shocks and the external variable. This can be combined with conventional sign restrictions to further narrow down the set of admissible models. Within a proxy-augmented SVAR, we conduct Bayesian inference and discuss computation of Bayes factors. They can be useful to test either the sign or IV restrictions as overidentifying. We illustrate the usefulness of our methodology in estimating the effects of oil supply and monetary policy shocks."

This is achieved by augmenting the one sector New Keynesian model with an alternate form of labour that seeks to expand the measure of goods available to consumers. I compare and contrast the transmissions of monetary policy shocks in the one sector ‘textbook’ model relative to the augmented model in both a representative agent (RANK) and heterogeneous agent (HANK) setting that includes a fully endogenous wealth distribution. The comparison highlights the role of capital income in the transmission of monetary policy shocks in these models. When the labour share moves counter-cyclically partial equilibrium decomposition’s of monetary policy transmission show a significant contractionary role for capital income."

Models identified via a sharp upper bound on the short-run price elasticity of supply, find supply shocks to be minor drivers. In turn, when replacing the upper bound with a fairly uninformative prior, supply shocks turn out to be quite important. In this paper, I revisit the evidence with a model identified by a combination of weakly informative priors and non-Gaussianity. For this purpose, a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model is developed where the distributions of the structural shocks are modelled non-parametrically. The empirical findings indicate that once non-Gaussianity is incorporated into the model, posterior mass of the short-run oil supply elasticity shifts towards zero and oil supply shocks become minor drivers of oil prices. In terms of contributions to the forecast error variance of oil prices, the model arrives at median estimates of just 6% over a 16-month horizon."

However, if the risk-weighted requirement is the binding constraint at the group level, applying regulatory requirements at the business unit level can lead to banks selecting riskier asset portfolios as optimal.

We show that this phenomenon occurs because Fed announcements affect investors’ risk appetite. Expansionary Fed information shocks increase investors’ risk appetite and drive capital towards foreign markets in pursuit of higher yields. Conversely, contractionary Fed information shocks decrease investors’ risk appetite and drive capital towards safe-haven currencies, causing an appreciation of the dollar and safe-haven currencies vis-à-visforeign currencies.

This reinvigorated the policy debate about dampening such ‘procyclicality’ of margin requirements. In this paper, we suggest how margin setters and policymakers might measure procyclicality and target particular levels of it. This procyclicality management involves recalibrating margin model parameters or applying anti-procyclicality (APC) tools. Different options reduce procyclicality by varying amounts, and do so at different costs, which we measure using the average additional margin required over the cycle. Thus, we perform a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the different options. We illustrate our approach using a popular type of margin model – filtered historical simulation value-at-risk – on simple portfolios, presenting the costs and benefits of varying a key model parameter and applying a number of different APC tools, including those in European legislation."

These links between inequality, credit and downturns are particularly significant for recessions associated with financial crises. We also find some evidence that low bank capital ahead of a downturn amplifies the inequality increase that follows. These insights add a new dimension to policy cost-benefit analysis, at the distributional level. Newly established macroprudential regimes have been empowered with tools to safeguard financial stability by bolstering both lender and borrower resilience.

For this reason, monetary authorities should not just aim at stabilising inflation and the output gap but also mitigate the volatility of their balance sheet. In response to negative demand shocks at the zero lower bound (ZLB), the optimal monetary policy consists of a mix of forward guidance and mild adjustments in the balance sheet. The presence of balance-sheet policies reduces the optimal ZLB duration and significantly improves social welfare. Mitigating the effectiveness of forward guidance calls for a more substantial balance-sheet expansion and a shorter ZLB duration. If a central bank only aims to stabilise inflation and the output gap, welfare losses are significantly larger than under the optimal policy and balance-sheet policies only improve welfare if the weight on output-gap stabilisation is relatively large. Last, simple implementable policy rules can achieve welfare outcomes close to those under the optimal policy."

We use our model to show that standard econometric techniques that correlate central bank text with measures of news coverage in order to determine what causes central bank communication to be reported on will likely prove to be biased. We use techniques from computational linguistics combined with an event-study methodology to measure the extent of news coverage a central bank communication receives, and the textual features that might cause a communication to be more (or less) likely to be considered newsworthy. We consider the case of the Bank of England, and estimate the relationship between news coverage and central bank communication implied by our model.

We conclude that the local lockdowns did causally reduce business activity but that activity would have probably fallen substantially even in the absence of the lockdowns. During the local lockdowns, the average turnover growth for SMEs in the UK was around -20%. SMEs that were up to two kilometres inside the lockdown boundaries had 8 percentage points lower turnover growth than those up to two kilometres outside. This implies that the local lockdowns accounted for two fifths of the overall drop in business activity at most. The estimates are largest for restaurants and non-food retail (eg clothes shops), which were directly targeted by the restrictions. Costs fell by much less than turnover, reducing cash flow."

We analyse the empirically observed fat left tail of the GDP distribution by modelling three key non-linearities emphasised in the literature: 1) an effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, 2) a credit crunch in bank credit supply when bank capital depletes, and 3) deleveraging by borrowers when debt service burdens become excessive. We obtain three key results. First, our model generates a significantly fat-tailed distribution of GDP – a finding that is absent in most linear New Keynesian and RBC models. Second, we show how these constraints interact with each other. We find that an economy prone to debt deleveraging will experience significantly more credit crunch and effective lower bound episodes than otherwise. Moreover, as the effective lower bound becomes more proximate, the frequency of credit crunch episodes increases significantly. As a rule of thumb, we find that each 50 basis point decline in monetary policy headroom requires additional capital buffers of 1% of assets or 2%–2.5% points lower debt service burdens to hold the risk level constant. Third, we use the model to generate a historical decomposition of GDP-at-Risk for the United Kingdom. The implied risk outlook deteriorates significantly in the run-up to the Global Financial Crisis, driven by depleted capital buffers and increasing debt burdens. Since then, GDP-at-Risk has remained elevated, with greater bank resilience and lower debt offset by the limited capacity of monetary policy to cushion adverse shocks."

At the other extreme, we show that if costs of implementing ML are low and there are few lower-risk borrowers, then lower-risk borrowers gain from the introduction of ML, at the expense of higher-risk and safe borrowers.

Higher inflation expectations reduce real interest rates, mitigating the effects of recessionary shocks. If debt duration is long enough, improved performance at the lower bound may outweigh higher welfare losses in normal times, compared with the case in which fiscal policy is ‘passive’."

 """,2021.,Identifying the transmission channels of credit supply shocks to household debt: price and non-price effects,"927, Bank of England.","Using matched microdata for the UK, I estimate two distinct channels via which credit supply shocks affect mortgage debt: one that operates through price conditions in credit markets; and another that operates through non-price credit conditions and affects the quantity of credit supplied by lenders. I find substantial heterogeneity in the different channels by age, financial situation, borrower type and income. Young households and home-owners respond exclusively to non-price credit conditions, in particular to changes in the supply of riskier lending. First-time buyers, middle-income households and middle-aged borrowers increase debt following shocks to either type of credit conditions. Debt responses of financially constrained borrowers are amplified by a simultaneous loosening in mortgage spreads and in credit availability at high loan to value or high loan to income ratios. In aggregate, household leverage responds more strongly to supply shocks that change the quantity of credit, as they affect households across the distribution, both at the intensive and at the extensive margin. But a loosening in price and non-price credit conditions simultaneously or a contraction in multiple price indicators at a time can also fuel rapid credit growth."

Among the linear models, the Ridge and the Partial Least Squares models report the largest gains consistently for most of the forecasting horizons, and for the non‑linear machine learning models, the SVR performs better at shorter horizons compared to the Neural Networks and Random Forest that seem to be more appropriate for longer‑term forecasting. Text based indicators appear to favour more the use of non‑linear models and the expansion of the information set with macroeconomic time series does not appear to add much more predictive power.

Our results suggest that the regulatory ratios we use are better aligned with risks which cause distress of large banks than with those which cause distress of small banks. We find that when thresholds are set to correctly identify a high proportion of banks which subsequently became distressed, they generate materially lower false alarm rates for large banks than for small. This result is robust to definitional choices and to resampling. We also test whether supervisors’ judgements about the quality of banks’ governance have predictive power with regard to distress.

We isolate a new theoretical mechanism: automation increases inequality via returns to wealth. The flip side of such return movements is that automation is more likely to lead to stagnant wages and therefore stagnant incomes at the bottom of the distribution. We use a multi-asset model extension to confront differing empirical trends in returns to productive and safe assets and show that the relevant return measures have increased over time.

As interbank networks become more connected and more regular in structure, the contagion risk of system-wide shocks and individual bank defaults initially increases and then decreases, all else being equal. The low density heterogeneous network structures that typify real interbank networks are particularly prone to solvency distress contagion risk, when banks are similar in balance sheet size and capitalisation. However, when networks are calibrated to UK data, the higher capitalisation of large, highly-connected banks relative to their interbank exposures significantly increases the resilience of the system and reduces the importance of network structure. These findings reinforce the importance and effectiveness of imposing higher capital buffers on systemically important banks and of policies that limit interbank exposures. We also demonstrate that for real-world interbank networks, simple network metrics other than individual bank connectedness do not provide robust indicators for monitoring solvency contagion risk, suggesting that policymakers should continue efforts to model these risks explicitly rather than rely on simple aggregate indicators."

 """,2021.,On the origin of systemic risk,"906, Bank of England.","Systemic risk in the banking sector is usually associated with long periods of economic downturn and very large social costs. On one hand, shocks coming from correlated exposures towards the real economy may induce correlation in banks’ default probabilities thereby increasing the likelihood for systemic tail events like the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. On the other hand, financial contagion also plays an important role in generating large-scale market failures, amplifying the initial shocks coming from the real economy. To study the sources of these rare phenomena, we propose a new definition of systemic risk (ie the probability of a large number of banks going into distress simultaneously) and thus we develop a multilayer microstructural model to study empirically the determinants of systemic risk. The model is then calibrated on the most comprehensive granular dataset for the euro-area banking sector, capturing roughly 96% or €23.2 trillion of euro-area banks’ total assets over the period 2014–2018. The outputs of the model decompose and quantify the sources of systemic risk showing that correlated economic shocks, financial contagion mechanisms, and their interaction are the main sources of systemic events. The results obtained with the simulation engine resemble common market-based systemic risk indicators and empirically corroborate findings from existing literature. This framework gives regulators and central bankers a tool to study systemic risk and its developments, pointing out that systemic events and banks’ idiosyncratic defaults have different drivers, hence implying different policy responses."

Under the objective of correctly identifying a high proportion of banks which subsequently failed, we find that a portfolio of a leverage ratio, a risk-weighted capital ratio, and a net stable funding ratio yields fewer false alarms than any of these metrics individually – and at less stringent calibrations of each individual regulatory metric.

By preventing conglomerates from using retail deposits to fund investment banking activities, this separation leads conglomerates to rebalance their activities towards domestic mortgage lending and away from supplying credit lines and underwriting services to large corporates. By redirecting the benefits of deposit funding towards the retail market, this rebalancing reduces the cost of credit for households, without eroding lending standards. However the rebalancing also increases mortgage market concentration and risk-taking by smaller banks via indirect competition effects."

 """,2020.,Liquidity and monetary transmission: a quasi-experimental approach,"891, Bank of England.","In the face of lower real interest rates, central bank balance sheets are likely to remain larger relative to pre-crisis levels, resulting in greater banking system liquidity. However, there is little evidence on the impact of higher liquidity on credit supply and the monetary transmission mechanism in the ‘new normal’. We exploit a novel dataset on bank liquidity positions arising from a unique regulatory regime and combine it with a highly-detailed, loan-level administrative dataset on UK mortgages. Using the design of quantitative easing auctions as an instrument for liquidity to address endogeneity, we find that more liquid banks charge slightly higher mortgage interest rates, and pass on significantly less changes in risk-free rates. We explain this through bank behaviour that attempts to preserve net interest margins in the face of holding low-yielding liquidity. Consistent with this, we find excess liquidity leads to reaching-for-yield responses in banks’ mortgage risk-taking. Additionally, the results shed light on the optimal mix between (un)conventional monetary policy tools. Policies that boost bank net interest margins are more likely to help the transmission of risk-free rates to lending rates."

We show that a flexible inflation targeting approach that places weight on stabilising inflation, a measure of resource utilisation, and a financial variable produces welfare benefits that are almost indistinguishable from fully-optimal Ramsey policy. The macro-financial trade-off in our estimated model of the euro area turns out to be modest, implying that the effects of financial frictions can be ameliorated at little cost in terms of inflation. A range of different financial objectives and policy preferences lead to similar conclusions."

 """,2020.,Monetary policy inertia and the paradox of flexibility,"888, Bank of England.","This paper revisits the paradox of flexibility, ie, the result that, in a liquidity trap, greater price flexibility amplifies output volatility in response to negative demand shocks. We argue this paradox is the consequence of a failure of standard models to correctly characterise monetary policy and that allowing for a smooth adjustment of the shadow policy rate eliminates the paradox and produces output responses to a negative demand shock that are in line with those under optimal monetary policy. The reason is that, under an inertial policy, a decline in the shadow rate implies that the future actual policy rate will remain relatively low, which increases expectations about the economic outlook and inflation. The rise in inflation expectations reduces the real rate, thereby sustaining real activity. As we raise the degree of price flexibility, a negative demand shock causes a sharper fall in the shadow rate and increase in inflation expectations, which leads to a more significant drop in the real rate and, hence, a milder decline in the output gap."

 """,2020.,Has bail-in increased market discipline? An empirical investigation of European banks’ credit spreads,"887, Bank of England.","Following the banking sector stress events of 2008–09 and 2011–12, a new framework for resolving failing banks has been implemented in the European Union which aims to facilitate authorities imposing losses on private creditors. The new framework implements global standards requiring banks to maintain a minimum quantum of loss-absorbing (or ‘bail-in’) bonds. Using data on the credit spreads on large European banks’ bonds between 2010 and 2019, we provide evidence that the risk sensitivity of banks’ credit spreads has increased since the reforms, and that the level and risk sensitivity of spreads on senior bail-in bonds are higher than those of comparable non-bail-in bonds. These findings support the hypothesis that the reforms have increased investors’ perception of the likelihood that they will be bailed in. These results hold for both UK and euro-area banks, though they are somewhat weaker for periphery European banks. We show that the degree of progress a bank has made in issuing bail-in bonds is positively related to the level and risk sensitivity of such bonds. We show that the higher level and risk sensitivity of spreads on bail-in bonds are largely invariant to whether bail-in bonds are contractually subordinated (ie issued as non-preferred senior) or structurally subordinated (ie issued from the holding company), and the effects are also unaffected by whether or not a bank is classified as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Finally, we show that the results are robust to changes in the strategy or risk profile of individual banks, via the inclusion of time-varying bank-specific effects."

We give an overview on the data, empirical specifications and results of the seven papers from the initiative. The papers are from a range of core and smaller advanced economies, and emerging markets. The main findings are as follows. First, there is evidence that macroprudential policy in recipient countries can partly offset the spillover effects of monetary policy conducted in core countries. Meanwhile, domestic macroprudential policy in core countries can also affect the cross‑border transmission of domestic monetary policy via lending abroad, by limiting the increase in lending by less strongly capitalised banks. Second, the findings highlight that studying heterogeneities across banks provides complementary insights to studies using more aggregate data and focusing on average effects. In particular, we find that individual bank characteristics such as bank size or G‑SIB status play a first‑order role in the transmission of these policies. Finally, the impacts differ considerably across prudential policy instruments, which also suggests the importance of more granular analysis."

Quantile regression provides a finer picture of the relationship (as compared with standard regression techniques) across institutions ranked according to how close each is to insolvency. We find that for domestic banks and building societies already close to insolvency the association is favourable, suggesting that risk decreases (increases) with more (less) competition. For foreign-owned banks and for relatively healthy building societies farther from insolvency we find the opposite, indicating that risk increases (decreases) with more (less) competition. We find that regulation is effective in moderating adverse links between risk and competition. Our results highlight real differences in the links between competition and risk at the individual level that are useful for assessing the link at the system-wide level."

We fill this gap by developing a two-country DSGE model that tracks domestic and cross-border gross positions between banks and households, with explicit settlement of all transactions through banks. We formalise the conceptual distinction between cross-border saving and financing, which often move in opposite directions in response to shocks. This matters for at least four policy debates. First, current accounts are poor indicators of financial vulnerability, because in a crisis, creditors stop financing debt rather than current accounts, and because following a crisis, current accounts are not the primary channel through which balance sheets adjust. Second, we reinterpret the global saving glut hypothesis by arguing that US households do not finance current account deficits with foreigners’ physical saving, but with digital purchasing power, created by banks that are more likely to be domestic than foreign. Third, Triffin’s current account dilemma is not in fact a dilemma, because the creation of additional US dollars requires dollar credit creation by US and non-US banks rather than US current account deficits. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed high correlation of gross capital inflows and outflows is overwhelmingly an automatic consequence of double entry bookkeeping, rather than the result of two separate sets of economic decisions."

Knowing the identity of the banks that receive reserves injections through the BOE’s APP (QE banks) provides us with an ideal empirical design for a difference-in-differences exercise. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) didn’t expect there to be strong transmission of the APP’s impact through the bank lending channel. In line with that, we find no evidence that suggests that QE directly boosted bank lending to the real economy, even when controlling fully for demand-side effects. The overall reduction of retail lending is more pronounced for treated (QE) banks than for the control group. QE banks reallocated their assets towards lower risk-weighted investments, such as government securities, as suggested by the increased sensitivity of their equity returns to peripheral EU bond returns. Overall, our findings suggest that, if banks are not adequately capitalised, risk-based capital constraints can limit the transmission of expansionary unconventional monetary policies via the bank lending channel, and provide incentives for carry trade activities."

We use our model to conduct a systemic stress simulation under different initial shock scenarios and institutions’ selling strategies. We find that performing a stress simulation that does not account for common asset holdings across multiple sectors can severely underestimate the fire sale losses in the financial system. We also show that a pro-rata liquidation strategy would result in a higher level of fire sale losses, but a waterfall strategy may produce a higher spill over effect for a passive institution (or a passive sector) that chooses not to liquidate any of its assets during distress."

Both types of gender pay gap have decreased over the sample, but remain in double digits. For ethnicity, the unconditional pay gap has been materially lower, compared to the gender pay gap, while the conditional pay gap is of similar magnitude to the gender one. These trends are apparent not only at the mean but also at the lower and upper ends of the distributions. Interaction effects between gender and ethnicity reveal that female ethnic minority workers experience a larger pay gap than both ethnic minority male, and white female workers. Half of the gender pay gap can be accounted for by compositional effects, such as the individual’s age, education, and the nature of their job, such as occupation and sector, while half remains unaccounted for. We find that the minimum wage leads to a decrease in the gender pay gap. Compositional effects for ethnicity suggest that ethnic minorities should be earning more than their white counterparts, with the unaccounted for factors driving the positive ethnicity pay gap. We find that compositional effects are heterogeneous across gender and ethnic minority groups. We assert that there is a strong case to extend compulsory pay gap reporting to ethnicity. There is also a case to extend compulsory reporting from firms with more than 250 employees to those with around 30 or more, to increase the coverage of the UK employed population."

We rationalize the relationship between training incidence and marital status with a simple two-period collective model of the household with limited commitment, where contemporaneous training decisions affect future bargaining power within the household. The core prediction of the model is confirmed empirically: the likelihood to participate in self-financed on-the-job training is negatively affected by higher levels of (a proxy for) intra-household bargaining power of the spouse of the individual. The results suggest there is scope for policy to increase workers’ training participation rates by targeting individuals with weaker bargaining power within the household."

Our mechanism is robust to the inclusion of liquidity yields, which instead contribute to explaining cross-sectional differences across currencies and reflect permanent innovations to investors’ stochastic discount factor."

Pass-through is faster for larger exchange rate changes than smaller ones; and for movements driven by the US dollar than for broader based exchange rate changes.

Global cycles in credit and housing have become much more pronounced and protracted since the 1980s, but their relevance increased for a sub-group of financially open and developed economies only. Panel regressions indicate that a country’s susceptibility to global financial cycles tends to increase with financial openness and financial integration, the extent of mortgage-related lending, and the efficiency of stock markets.

We show two applications for our shadow rate. First, we decompose shadow rate responses to monetary policy announcements into conventional and unconventional monetary policy surprises, and assess the pass-through of each type of policy to exchange rates.

Specifically, banks originating from a country that has lower level of trust tend to have lower interbank borrowing. Using a proprietary dataset on bilateral exposures, we investigate the Euro Area interbank network and find the effect of trust relies on the network structure of interbank markets. Core banks acting as interbank intermediaries in the network are more significantly influenced by trust in obtaining interbank funding, while being more exposed in a community can mitigate the negative effect of low trust.

But quality matters: an increase in the holdings of High Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) qualifying sovereign debt offsets some of the reduction in total cross-border lending growth. Furthermore, the strongest reduction is driven by foreign subsidiaries from countries where sovereigns do not issue HQLA; in contrast subsidiaries from countries issuing HQLA are able to protect their lending to unrelated entities and cut their intragroup lending instead. Banks with a higher deposit share as a consequence of established retail operations, such as those headquartered in the UK, are also able to offset the effects of increases of liquidity requirement on cross-border lending."

Using US and euro-area data, we estimate a general equilibrium model in which the extensive margin of exports varies over the business cycle. A comparison of its performance to two similar models that differ in their modelling of the extensive margin of exports shows that, while recent advances in modelling the extensive margin of trade help replicate exports dynamics, this is not the result of a good fit to the observed extensive margin of exports: the model-implied extensive margin of exports varies considerably more than the data suggests."

Workers can save in bonds subject to portfolio adjustment costs; firm ownership is concentrated among capitalists who do not supply labor. The model matches empirical intertemporal marginal propensities to consume that shape the private sector’s dynamic response to policy interventions, it avoids implausible profit income effects on labor supply and the solution has robust stability properties. This setup delivers both more pronounced redistributive and more muted aggregate effects of fiscal stimulus relative to the traditional two-agent model."

We present evidence that a monetary policy tightening robustly increased the labor share and decreased real wages during the Great Moderation period in the US, the euro area, the UK, Australia and Canada. We show that this is inconsistent not only with the basic NK model, but with medium-scale NK models commonly used for monetary policy analysis and where it is possible to break the direct link between the labor share and the inverse mark-up.

To examine how lenders account for extreme weather, we compare matched repeat mortgage and property transactions around a severe flood event in England in 2013–14. First, lender valuations do not ‘mark-to-market’ against local price declines. As a result valuations are biased upwards. Second, lenders do not offset this valuation bias by adjusting interest rates or loan amounts. Third, borrowers with low credit risk self-select into high flood risk areas. Overall, these results suggest that lenders do not track closely the impact of extreme weather ex-post, and that public flood insurance programs may subsidise high income households."

A cryptocurrency has two distinctive features: a price determined by the extent of its usage as money, and a blockchain structure that restricts settlement capacity. Limited settlement space creates competition between users of the currency, so speculative activity can crowd out monetary usage. This crowding-out undermines the ability of a cryptocurrency to act as a medium of payment, lowering its value. Higher speculative demand can reduce prices, contrary to standard economic models. Crowding-out also raises the riskiness of investing in cryptocurrency, explaining high observed price volatility."

Exploiting information from a unique panel of corporate bonds matched with balance sheet data for US non-financial firms, we document that firms with high leverage experience a more pronounced increase in credit spreads than firms with low leverage. A large fraction of this increase is due to a component of credit spreads that is in excess of firms’ expected default — the excess bond premium. Consistent with the spreads response, we also document that high-leverage firms experience a sharper contraction in debt and investment than low-leverage firms. Our results provide evidence that balance sheet effects are crucial for understanding the transmission mechanism of monetary policy."

The analysis finds a significant negative relationship between bank solvency and the different types of funding costs. It also shows that this relationship is non-linear, namely convex, for senior bond yields and term deposit rates. It also identifies a positive realistic solvency threshold beyond which the effect of an increase in solvency on senior bond yields becomes positive. The paper also finds that senior bond yields are more sensitive to a change in solvency than deposit rates. Among the deposit rates, the interest rates of the overnight deposits are the least sensitive. Banks’ asset quality, profitability and liquidity seem to play only a minor role in driving funding costs while the ECB monetary policy stance, sovereign risk and financial markets uncertainty appear to be material drivers."

 """,2020.,Impact of IFRS 9 on the cost of funding of banks in Europe,"851, Bank of England.","On implementation, IFRS 9 increases credit loss (impairment) charges and reduces after-tax profits of banks. This makes retained earnings and hence capital resources lower than what they would be under IAS 39. To maintain their capital ratios under IFRS 9, banks could elect to hold higher levels of equity capital. This paper uses a modified version of CAPM, which accounts for the low-risk anomaly (as suggested by Baker and Wurgler (2015)), to estimate the impact of this potential increase in capital levels on the cost of funding of banks in six European countries, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. We confirm the existence of low-risk anomaly for banks’ equity in the six countries, except France. The magnitude of the anomaly varies across countries, but is generally low relative to the long-run cost of equity for banks. Our results show that, on day 1, the implementation of IFRS 9 has minor impact on the cost of funding of banks in the six countries."

We find that monetary spillovers via cross-border lending can be partially offset by prudential measures in receiving countries. We then explore heterogeneities in that interaction, specifically the difference made by bank size and location of the affiliate (French headquarters vs. affiliates based in the UK, an international financial centre). Focusing on lending from France, we find that the response of GSIBs’ lending to EA monetary policy is less sensitive to recipient-country prudential policy than non-GSIBs’. In contrast, the response of lending to EA monetary policy from French-owned GSIB affiliates in the UK is sensitive to recipient-country prudential policy. We also find evidence that French GSIBs channel funds towards the UK in response to EA monetary policy, in a manner that is dampened by the global prudential policy setting. Together, these findings suggest the existence of a ‘London Bridge’: conditional on EA monetary policy, French GSIBs adjust their funds in the UK in response to global prudential policies and, from there, lend to third countries, responding to local prudential policies. French GSIBs’ cross-border lending from their headquarters to EA monetary policy responds differently to foreign prudential policies than their lending from international financial centres. Finally, we find evidence of a similar pattern for all EA-owned bank affiliates in the UK, suggesting a broader relevance of the London Bridge."

Our model predicts that US GDP-linked bonds would typically have yields lower than those on conventional Treasury bonds with the same maturity in our sample from 2010 to 2017. Positive expected future GDP growth lowers the yield on GDP-linked bonds relative to conventional bonds, which typically more than offsets the estimated GDP risk premium demanded by investors for holding GDP risk.

 """,2020.,Compositional nature of firm growth and aggregate fluctuations,"846, Bank of England.","This paper studies firm dynamics over the business cycle. I present evidence from the United Kingdom that more rapidly growing firms are born in expansions than in recessions. Using administrative records from Census data, I find that this observation also holds for the last four recessions in the United States. I also present suggestive evidence that financial frictions play an important role in determining the types of firms that are born at different stages of the business cycle. I then develop a general equilibrium model in which firms choose their managers’ span of control at birth. Firms that choose larger spans of control grow faster and eventually get to be larger, and in this sense have a larger target size. Financial frictions in the form of collateral constraints slow the rate at which firms reach their target size. It takes firms longer to get up to scale when collateral constraints tighten; therefore, businesses with the largest target size are affected disproportionately more. Thus, fewer entrepreneurs find it profitable to choose larger projects when financial conditions deteriorate. Using Bayesian methods, I estimate the model using micro and aggregate data from the United Kingdom. I find that financial shocks account for over 80% of fluctuations in the formation of businesses with a large target size, and TFP and labour wedge shocks account for the remaining 20%. An independently estimated version of the model with no choice over the span of control needs larger aggregate shocks in order to account for the same data series, suggesting that the intensive margin of business formation is important at business cycle frequencies. The model with the choice over the span of control generates an empirically relevant and non-targeted collapse in the right tail of the cumulative growth distribution among firms started in recessions, while the model without such a choice does not. The paper also discusses implications for micro-targeted government stimulus policies."

I show that across successive monetary and fiscal regimes, and a variety of asset classes, real interest rates have not been ‘stable’, and that since the major monetary upheavals of the late middle ages, a trend decline between 0.6–1.6 basis points per annum has prevailed. A gradual increase in real negative-yielding rates in advanced economies over the same horizon is identified, despite important temporary reversals such as the 17th Century Crisis. Against their long-term context, currently depressedbsovereign real rates are in fact converging ‘back to historical trend’ — a trend that makes narratives about a ‘secular stagnation’ environment entirely misleading, and suggests that — irrespective of particular monetary and fiscal responses — real rates could soon enter permanently negative territory. I also posit that the return data here reflects a substantial share of ‘non-human wealth’ over time: the resulting R-G series derived from this data show a downward trend over the same timeframe: suggestions about the ‘virtual stability’ of capital returns, and the policy implications advanced by Piketty (2014) are in consequence equally unsubstantiated by the historical record."

This resulted in a persistent and growing investment gap between cash-rich and cash-poor firms. Cash especially benefited young and small firms and firms in industries where rivals became more financially constrained. The amplification effect of cash was absent in the period preceding the crisis. The ability to continue to invest allowed cash-rich firms to gain market share and accumulate more profits over the long-run. Having a liquid balance sheet when the credit cycle turns thus gives firms a competitive edge that lasts far beyond the crisis years.

To combat this, we introduce a unique production function approach to estimate firm-specific technology shocks, accounting for firm-level heterogeneity and common shocks. Using this measure, we find that firm-level shocks matter; the ‘granular residual’ explains around 30% of aggregate UK productivity dynamics. We also show that simplifications of our approach, which omit controlling for firm-level heterogeneity or do not account for common shocks, do not perform well, highlighting the importance of identifying firm-specific shocks correctly in order to properly test the ‘granularity hypothesis’."

The key condition required for the coexistence of both platforms on the market, to have effective competition, relies on the relative strength of switching costs over the network effects. Only when switching costs are stronger than cross-group network benefits is market tipping avoided. The same condition also underpins the presence of a material incumbency advantage vis-à-vis the entrant platform. Therefore, regulatory intervention aimed at facilitating switching, for example by imposing data portability, might worsen entry condition as the incumbent platform is less accommodative. Besides the standard configuration with exogenous singlehoming, we also fully characterise the model with endogenous multihoming on both sides. Partial multihoming occurs only on one side, the one with comparatively lower switching costs. However, in contrast to the seminal ‘competition bottleneck’ model, on the opposite side, where singlehoming arises endogenously, agents face higher prices than under exogenous singlehoming. Therefore, the incumbent platform would normally opt for this regime, whereas we show that the entrant is basically indifferent between the two."

Where buffers are insufficient we assume institutions borrow additional liquidity to cover the shortfalls, but only at the last moment when payment is due. Such delays can force recipients to borrow more than otherwise, and so liquidity shortfalls can grow in aggregate as they spread through the network. However, we find an aggregate liquidity shortfall equivalent to only a small fraction of average daily cash borrowing in international repo markets. Moreover, we find that only a small part of this aggregate shortfall could be avoided if payments were co‑ordinated centrally."

It shows that the rise in house prices relative to incomes between 1985 and 2018 can be more than accounted for by the substantial decline in the real risk‑free interest rate observed over the period. This is slightly offset by net increases in home‑ownership costs from higher rates of tax. Changes in the risk‑free real rate are a crucial driver of changes in house prices — the model predicts that a 1% sustained increase in index‑linked gilt yields could ultimately (ie in the long run) result in a fall in real house prices of just under 20%."

Using BoE proprietary data, we show that participation in ILTR is not skewed towards riskier counterparties, and is instead consistent with safe counterparties using the facilities to meet their liquidity needs. Collateral assets used for FLS are less liquid, since almost all assets are loan portfolios. Riskier and larger institutions are more likely to pre-position collateral in the FLS, but these counterparties do not subsequently draw upon FLS more than others do. Overall, our study points to no systemic misincentives; rather banks react to incentives in the manner intended by the policy objectives.

If the prior is set to a smooth trend, then models with little correlation between the trend and cycle shocks are the likeliest to fit the data. On the other hand, if there is a prior belief that the trend shock is allowed to vary relatively freely, the results suggest that there is a negative correlation between trend and cycle shocks to LIK productivity. This is consistent with real-business cycle type narratives, where trend shocks are the main driver of productivity dynamics. Finally, our evidence suggests that the trend productivity growth rate in the UK has been weaker since the financial crisis.

We show that in the case of QE alone, the pass-through of the gilt supply shock to corporate bond prices is significant, is larger in the longer-run than at announcement, and is often limited to the default-free component of the corporate yield. In the case of the joint conduct of QE and CE, we find that the CE is more effective than QE in reducing credit spreads, especially for higher-rated bonds, and in stimulating corporate bond issuance, which responds quite rapidly to the corporate bond supply shock."

 """,2019.,"Credit, capital and crises: a GDP-at-Risk approach","824, Bank of England.","How can macroeconomic tail risks originating from financial vulnerabilities be monitored systematically over time? This question lies at the heart of operationalising the macroprudential policy regimes that have developed around the world in response to the global financial crisis. Using quantile regressions applied to a panel dataset of 16 advanced economies, we examine how downside risk to growth over the medium term, GDP-at-Risk, is affected by a set of macroprudential indicators. We find that credit booms, property price booms and wide current account deficits each pose material downside risks to growth at horizons of three to five years. We find that such downside risks can be partiall y mitigated, however, by increasing the capitalisation of the banking system. We estimate that across our sample of countries, GDP-at-Risk, defined as the 5th quantile of the projected GDP growth distribution over three years, on average deteriorated by around 4.5 percentage points cumulatively in the run-up to the crisis. Our estimates suggest that an increase in bank capital equivalent to a countercyclical capital buffer rate of 2.5% (5%) would have been sufficient to mitigate up to 20% (40%) of this increase in medium-term macroeconomic tail risk."

 """,2019.,Market-implied systemic risk and shadow capital adequacy,"823, Bank of England.","This paper presents a forward-looking approach to measure systemic solvency risk using contingent claims analysis (CCA) as a theoretical foundation for determining an institution’s default risk based on the uncertainty in its asset value relative to promised debt payments over time. Default risk can be quantified as market-implied expected losses calculated from integrating equity market and balance sheet information in a structural default risk model. The expected losses of multiple banks and their non-parametric dependence structure define a multivariate distribution that generates portfolio-based estimates of the joint default risk using the aggregation technique of the Systemic CCA framework (Jobst and Gray, 2013). This market-implied valuation approach (‘shadow capital adequacy’) endogenises bank solvency as a probabilistic concept based on the perceived default risk (in contrast to accounting-based prudential measures of capital adequacy). The presented model adds to the literature of analytical tools estimating market-implied systemic risk by augmenting the CCA approach with a jump diffusion process of asset changes to inform a more comprehensive and flexible assessment of common vulnerabilities to tail risks of the four largest UK commercial banks."

Although the literature has identified at length the pros and cons of having either a central bank or a separate agency responsible for microprudential banking supervision, the advantages of having this task shared by both institutions (shared supervision) have received considerably less attention. This paper fills this void by comparing the impact of three supervisory governance models — supervision by the central bank, by an agency or by both of them — on bank non‑performing loans. Using a new database on supervisory governance in 116 countries from 1970 to 2016, it finds that supervisory governance per se does not significantly affect non‑performing loans. However, it also finds that, where the risk of capture is high, shared supervision is associated with a significant reduction in non‑performing loans. This is in line with the supervisory capture theory, whereby it is more costly to capture two supervisors rather than one. Overall, these results provide new evidence in support of the relevance of supervisory governance in hampering supervisory capture from the banking sector."

I further find heterogeneity in pricing across lenders: those who rely on high fees tend to have higher funding cost, lower return on equity and larger branch networks, in line with a specialization equilibrium in which high-cost lenders are able to match with less cost-sensitive consumers."

We identify three key results. First, the UK’s decision to leave the EU has generated a large, broad and long-lasting increase in uncertainty. Second, anticipation of Brexit is estimated to have gradually reduced investment by about 11% over the three years following the June 2016 vote. This fall in investment took longer to occur than predicted at the time of the referendum, suggesting that the size and persistence of this uncertainty may have delayed firms’ response to the Brexit vote. Finally, the Brexit process is estimated to have reduced UK productivity by between 2% and 5% over the three years after the referendum. Much of this drop is from negative within-firm effects, in part because firms are committing several hours per week of top-management time to Brexit planning. We also find evidence for smaller negative between-firm effects as more productive, internationally exposed, first have been more negatively impacted than less productive domestic firms."

The model combines the UIP-based and monetary theories of exchange rate determination, but the latter with a focus on private rather than public money creation.

This spread experiences sizeable changes when shocks affect the relative supplies (of bank loans) or demands (for bank deposits) of the two currencies. Under such shocks, monetary effects dominate traditional UIP effects in the determination of exchange rates and allocations, and this becomes stronger as domestic and foreign currencies become more imperfect substitutes.

This method investigates the inputs and outputs of the model, but not its inner workings. It measures feature influences by intervening on inputs and estimating their Shapley values, representing the features’ average marginal contributions over all possible feature combinations. This method estimates key drivers of mortgage defaults such as the loan‑to‑value ratio and current interest rate, which are in line with the findings of the economics and finance literature. However, given the non‑linearity of ML model, explanations vary significantly for different groups of loans. We use clustering methods to arrive at groups of explanations for different areas of the input space. Finally, we conduct simulations on data that the model has not been trained or tested on. Our main contribution is to develop a systematic analytical framework that could be used for approaching explainability questions in real world financial applications. We conclude though that notable model uncertainties do remain which stakeholders ought to be aware of."

We use a standard model to analyse the conditions under which leverage and debt maturity determine the sensitivity of firms’ investment decisions to financial shocks. We show that the presence of long-term investment projects and frictions to the issuance of long-term debt are needed for the model to rationalize the empirical findings. We conclude that the differential responses of firms to a financial shock do not provide unambiguous information to identify these shocks.

Second, we test the resilience of these markets to the failure or paralysis of a key dealer, or to bond rating downgrades. We find that whilst the network structure has been broadly stable and the market broadly resilient around bond downgrades over our 2012–2017 sample period, the reliance on a small number of participants makes the trading network somewhat fragile to the withdrawal of a few key dealers from the market."

Nonetheless, that consensus is based on within-country studies of default. This paper examines the determinants of mortgage default across five European countries, using a large dataset of over 2.3 million active mortgage loans originated between 1991 and 2013 across over 150 banks. The analysis finds support for both elements of the double trigger: while negative equity itself is a relatively small contributor to default, the effect of unemployment, and other variables such as the interest rate, is stronger for those in negative equity. The double trigger, however, varies by country: country-specific factors are found to have a large effect on default rates. For any given level of a loan’s Loan to Value (‘LTV’) ratio, and as LTV changes, borrowers were more sensitive to the interest rate and unemployment in Ireland and Portugal than in the UK or the Netherlands."

These agents interact in asset, funding (repo), and derivatives markets and face a range of solvency and liquidity constraints on their behaviour. Our model generates ‘tipping points’ such that, if shocks are large, or if headroom relative to constraints is small, lower asset prices can cause solvency/liquidity constraints to bind, resulting in forced deleveraging and large endogenous illiquidity premia. We illustrate such an outcome via a stress scenario in which a deteriorating corporate sector outlook coincides with tighter leverage limits at key intermediaries. Our findings highlight the key role played by broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment funds and life insurers in shaping these dynamics."

We model market participants’ incentives to buy or sell corporate bonds in response to initial price falls, the constraints under which they operate (including those arising due to regulation), and how the resulting behaviour may amplify initial falls in price and impact market functioning. We find that the magnitude of amplification depends on the cause of the initial reduction in price and is larger in the case of shocks to credit risk or risk-free interest rates, than in the case of a perceived deterioration in corporate bond market liquidity. Amplification also depends on agents’ proximity to their regulatory constraints. We further find that long-term institutional investors (eg pension funds) only partially mitigate the amplification due to their slower-moving nature. Finally, we find that shocks to corporate bond spreads, similar in magnitude to the largest weekly moves observed in the past, could trigger asset sales that may test the capacity of dealers to absorb them."

The decline in the utilised aggregate stock of R&D determines a fall in productivity, which causes a long-term decline in the main macroeconomic aggregates. When households feature Epstein-Zin preferences, they become averse to these long-term risks affecting their consumption process (long-run risk channel), which strongly exacerbates the precautionary savings motive and the overall negative effects of uncertainty shocks."

We start by establishing several facts on market power in UK markets using micro data. First, while no clear trend emerges for market concentration, market power measured by markups estimated at the firm level have clearly increased in recent years, with the rise being reasonably broad-based across sectors. Second, we show that the increase is heavily concentrated in the upper tail of the distribution — companies whose mark-ups are in, say, the top quartile. Third, internationally-oriented firms are the driving force behind the rise in markups. Fourth, following Díez et al (2018), we find some reduced-form evidence of a non-monotonic relation between markups and investment at the firm level, with high levels of markups being associated with lower investment. Having established these facts, we show that the Phillips curve becomes steeper in the textbook New Keynesian model when firms tend to have more market power, reducing the sacrifice ratio for monetary policy. As inflation becomes less costly in an economy with high market power, however, the optimal targeting rule for monetary policy also changes. A rise in both the trend and volatility of mark-ups may lead to a significant rise in inflation variability. But a secular rise in mark-ups by itself improves monetary policy’s ability to stabilise inflation without inducing large movements in output."

We find that changes in gilt repo market functioning over the past five years have been driven largely by changes in the supply of repo market intermediation by dealers, rather than by changes in the demand of end-users. Following the introduction of the UK leverage ratio, our model suggests that an increase in demand for repo by end-users results in a larger increase in the cost of repo transactions and a smaller increase in their volume. This effect is stronger in the case of transactions that are not nettable via central counterparties. These findings are consistent with the notion that the leverage ratio may reduce dealers’ ability and/or willingness to act as repo market intermediaries.

But why did central banks in the past frequently restrict the supply of loans during financial crises? In this paper, we draw on a large novel, loan-level data set to study the Bank of England’s policy response to the crisis of 1847. We find that credit rationing due to residual imperfect information in the sense of Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) cannot be a convincing explanation for quantitative credit restrictions during the crisis of 1847. We provide preliminary evidence which could suggest that discriminatory credit rationing on the basis of loan applicants’ type and identity characterized the Bank of England’s (BoE’s) response to the crisis of 1847. Our results also show that collateral characteristics played an important role in the BoE’s loan decisions, even after controlling for the identity of loan applicants. This finding confirms the hypothesis in Capie (2002) and Flandreau and Ugolini (2011, 2013, 2014) that the characteristics of bills of exchange submitted to the discount window mattered.

Banks constrained by the leverage ratio prefer to first sell assets that are liquid and held in small amounts, while banks constrained by the risk-weighted capital ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio need to trade off assets’ liquidity with their regulatory weights. We calibrate the model to the UK banking system, and find that banks’ optimal liquidation strategies translate into moderate fire-sale losses even for extremely large solvency shocks. By contrast, severe funding shocks can generate significant losses. Thus models focusing exclusively on solvency risk may significantly underestimate the extent of contagion via fire sales. Moreover, when studying combined funding and solvency shocks, we find complementarities between the two shocks’ effects that cannot be reproduced by focusing on either shock in isolation."

In 2010–13, firms responding to negative shocks were most likely to reduce employment, then hourly wages and then hours worked, regardless of the source of the shock. Results for the 2008–09 period indicate that the ranking might change during deep recession as the likelihood of wage cuts increases. In response to positive shocks in 2010–13, firms were more likely to increase wages, followed by increases in employment and then hours worked suggesting an asymmetric reaction to positive and negative shocks. Finally, we show that strict employment protection legislation and high centralisation or coordination of wage bargaining make it less likely that firms reduce wages when facing negative shocks."

 """,2019.,Housing consumption and investment:evidence from shared equity mortgages,"790, Bank of England.","Academics have proposed hybrid products with equity features for the financing of housing. In spite of their risk-sharing benefits these products have not become mainstream. This paper studies an important exception, a UK government scheme which in the five years since its inception has provided almost £10 billion of equity financing. The analysis of the origination and prepayment behavior of households who have used the scheme highlights housing affordability constraints. A difference-in-difference analysis of an increase in the maximum government equity limit shows that households took advantage of the increase to buy more expensive properties, and not to reduce their mortgage debt and house price risk exposure. A counterfactual study of homebuyers who, instead of using the equity available, relied on high loan-to-value mortgages shows that their financing choices can be rationalized by an expected rate of house price appreciation of 7.7% per year. We draw general implications for how households approach their house purchase and financing decisions, taking advantage of the fact that the shared equity mortgages that we study allow the separation of the consumption and investment dimensions of housing."

Small sample properties of the test are explored in a small Monte Carlo exercise. Generally, we find little evidence for cointegration when parameters are constant, but strong evidence when allowing for time variation. The implications are that in macroeconometric models (including DSGE models), provision should be made to explicitly facilitate such shifting long-run relationships."

In our New Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions, migration flows are driven by fluctuations in the relative labor market performance across the monetary union. The optimizing monetary policymaker shows greater flexibility in inflation targeting when labor is mobile by leaning somewhat against deviations of migration flows from efficient benchmarks. But strict inflation targeting remains close to optimal. For a given monetary policy, labor mobility facilitates macroeconomic adjustments by reducing efficiency gaps in regional labor markets. Internal migration therefore reduces the welfare costs of following simple suboptimal monetary policy rules in a monetary union."

We incorporate two features into a simple sticky-price model to generalize these results. First, that money may earn a strictly positive rate of return, motivated by recent debates on the introduction of central bank digital currencies and the introduction of interest-bearing reserves. This allows money-financed transfers to be used as a policy instrument at the effective lower bound, without giving up the ability to use the short-term bond rate to stabilize the economy in normal times. Second, a simple financial friction generates a wealth effect on household spending from government liabilities. Though temporary money-financed transfers to households can stimulate spending and inflation when the short-term bond rate is constrained by a lower bound, similar effects could be achieved by bond-financed tax cuts. So our results do not provide compelling reasons to choose monetary financing rather than bond financing."

A surrogate parametric regression analysis is performed in the space spanned by the Shapley value expansion of a model. This allows for the testing of standard hypotheses of interest. At the same time, the proposed approach provides novel insights into statistical learning processes themselves derived from the consistency and bias properties of the nonparametric estimators. We apply the framework to the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in simulated and real-world randomised experiments. We introduce an explicit treatment function based on higher-order Shapley-Taylor indices. This can be used to identify potentially complex treatment channels and help the generalisation of findings from experimental settings. More generally, the presented approach allows for a standardised use and communication of results from machine learning models."

In the model, firm liquidations and zombie lending arise endogenously. The model provides a good match to key euro-area firm statistics over the period 2011 to 2014. A key finding is that zombie lending has a substantial impact on borrowing costs, helping more low-productivity firms to survive.

Yet the recurrent nature of such swings may not appear so obvious when looking at conventionally plotted time-series data (that is, observed in calendar time). Using the pioneering framework developed by Stock (1987), we offer a new statistical characterisation of the financial cycle using a continuous-time autoregressive model subject to time deformation (ie the difference between the time scale relevant for economic decision-making and conventional calendar time such as months, quarters and years), and test for systematic differences between calendar and a new notion of financial cycle time.

Consistent with the existing literature, we show that the direction of the wealth transfer at the conversion of CoCo bonds determines their impact on shareholder risk-taking incentives. We also find that ‘anytime’ CoCos (CoCo bonds trigger-able anytime at the discretion of managers) have a minor advantage over regulator CoCo bonds, and that quality of capital requirements can reduce the risk-taking incentives of shareholders. We argue that shareholders can also use manager-specific CoCo bonds to reduce the riskiness of the bank activities. The issuance of such bonds can increase the resilience of individual banks and the whole banking system. Regulators can use restrictions on conversion rates and/or requirements on the quality of capital to address the impact of CoCo bonds issuance on risk-taking incentives."

In particular, we show that lowering the interest rate makes it more likely banks will make risky investments. This is because reducing the interest rate makes safer assets less attractive, while increasing the relative gains from gambling. We show that risk-taking is highly dependent on banks’ skin-in-the-game, as banks always ignore the full extent of losses on bankruptcy. Raising the interest rate has a similar effect. It reinforces this behaviour, as by increasing the yield on the portfolio, banks have more to lose on bankruptcy."

STW use is higher in countries with formalised schemes and in countries where these schemes were extended in response to the recent crisis. On the wider economic impact of STW, we show that firms using the schemes are significantly less likely to lay off permanent workers in response to a negative shock, with no impact for temporary workers.

We show how this varies over the financial cycle with market volatility. We then assess the ability of a macroprudential buffer to reduce this externality. We find this depends critically on the release conditions of the buffer. A buffer could reduce or, if set appropriately, even eliminate the externality, as long as it was released when investors faced any significant collateral calls, regardless of whether these related to variation or initial margins. However, it could be harmful if it was released only with calls for additional initial margin. Predicated on ideal release conditions, we test the performance of macroprudential buffers based on ‘anti-procyclicality’ mechanisms in current regulations. These mechanisms can reduce the fire-sale externality in some market conditions, but not all. Conceptually, we devise alternative mechanismsthat eliminate the externality, although it may be difficult for policymakers to specify these in practice. Finally, as an alternative to quantity-based solutions, we investigate the ability of taxes to reduce the externality. We find that such a price-based solution could also eliminate the externality if set appropriately, but this would require a high tax rate and the redistribution of significant tax revenues."

Our results suggest that pension funds are sensitive to shocks that change their funding ratios — that is, the ratio of pension assets to liabilities. Deteriorations in funding ratios encourage pension funds supported by financially weaker corporate sponsors to switch some equity holdings into bonds. This is because reduced funding ratios weigh on the perceived vulnerability of already weak corporate sponsors. But similar deteriorations in funding ratios encourage funds supported by financially stronger corporates to increase their equity holdings to benefit from their higher expected returns. In contrast, shocks that result in material improvements in funding ratios — for example, resulting from a large rise in interest rates — encourage all pension funds to increase their bond holdings to ‘lock in’ those improved positions."

This paper analyses the responses to the questions about banks to understand whether banks were seen as a special case. Support for modifying the law to make limited liability more easily available to banks was lower than for enterprises in general. Banks were seen as a special case because of the risk of bank runs and because their creditors were not able to assess accurately the riskiness of banks. But the special nature of banks caused others to favour limited liability because it made banks’ capital levels more transparent. These arguments echo wider debates during the nineteenth century and are similar to contemporary theories for why banks are regulated.

The macroeconomic effects are well documented, but the effect on business decisions much less so. In this paper, we explore corporate data to investigate how economic uncertainty affected investment, dividend payouts and cash holdings, based on over 10,000 UK firm-year observations. We offer new insights into the relationship between business decisions and uncertainty, by exploiting two surveys of macroeconomic uncertainty from professional forecasters and CFOs collected by the Bank of England. These data demonstrate that heightened economic uncertainty lowered investment even after controlling for investment opportunities, sales growth, and the firm’s own stock volatility. Economic uncertainty also explains the rise in cash holdings and the fall in payouts. Hence, our results help explain why UK firms invested so little and held so much cash at a time of historically low interest rates, and also why they paid out smaller dividends. These results may help explain recent sluggish productivity in the UK economy, and they also are important, because they provide a benchmark for future studies of Brexit-related uncertainty."

 """,2018.,"Banks, money and the zero lower bound on deposit rates","752, Bank of England.","We develop a New Keynesian model where all payments between agents require bank deposits, bank deposits are created through disbursement of bank loans, and banks face convex lending costs. At the zero lower bound on deposit rates (ZLBD), changes in policy rates affect activity through both real interest rates and banks’ net interest margins (NIMs). At empirically plausible credit supply elasticities, the Phillips curve is very flat at the ZLBD. This is because inflation increases NIMs, credit, deposits, and thereby output, while higher NIMs also dampen inflation by relaxing price setters’ credit rationing constraint. At the ZLBD, monetary policy has far larger effects on output relative to inflation, and inflation feedback rules stabilize output less effectively than rules that also respond to credit. For post-COVID-19 policy, this suggests urgency in returning inflation to targets, caution with negative policy rates, and a strong influence of credit conditions on rate setting."

Specifically, a client pays a higher price to buy interest-rate protection from a dealer (ie, the client pays a higher fixed rate) if the contract is not cleared via a central counterparty. This OTC premium decreases by posting initial margin and with higher buyer's creditworthiness. Also, OTC premia are absent for dealers suggesting dealers' bargaining power."

We show how the nonlinearities associated with the two constraints make the transmission of monetary policy dependent on the housing cycle, with weaker effects observed when house prices are high or start falling sharply. We also find that higher average loan duration makes monetary policy less effective, and may lead to asymmetric responses to positive and negative monetary shocks."

We construct several measures of competition and test the relationship between competition and bank stability. We find that, on average, competition lowers stability, but that its effect varies across banks depending on the underlying financial health of the institution. Competition encourages relatively less sound banks (closer to insolvency) to reduce costs, lower portfolio risk and increase capital ratios, strengthening their stability, while it lowers the incentives of relatively more sound banks (farther from insolvency) to build capital ratios, weakening their stability. These findings imply trade-offs at the bank-level that may need to be weighed when evaluating policies with consequences for competition."

We describe and calibrate the policy interventions a macroprudential regulator would wish to make to address these vulnerabilities.

Banks in our model are subject to two types of moral hazard: i) ex-ante, they have the incentive to shirk on project monitoring, thus increasing the risk of failure, and ii) ex-post, poorly capitalised banks have the incentive to engage in asset substitution by ‘gambling for resurrection’. Ex-ante moral hazard can be eliminated by ensuring that banks have sufficient capital and uninsured ‘bail-inable’ debt, while ex-post moral hazard is mitigated by triggering resolution when the minimum capital requirement is breached. We argue that optimal regulation consists of a high TLAC requirement and high capital buffer. Our analysis also suggests that higher system-wide risk would call for a higher capital buffer, but TLAC could be lowered if it does not jeopardise the credibility of bail-in itself."

Flash episodes occur in the model due to the procyclical behaviour of high-frequency market participants. This is aligned with some empirical evidence as to the drivers of real-world flash crashes. We find that the prevalence of flash episodes increases with the frequency with which high-frequency market participants trade compared to their low-frequency counterparts. This provides tentative theoretical evidence that the recent growth in high-frequency trading across some markets has led to flash episodes. Furthermore, we adapt the model so that large movements in price trigger temporary halts in trading (ie circuit breakers). This is found to reduce the magnitude and frequency of flash episodes."

First, from the perspective of the central banks, it shows that the swap line mimics discount-window credit from the source central bank to the recipient-country banks using the recipient central bank as the bearer of the credit risk. Second, from the perspective of the transmission of monetary policy, it shows that the swap-line rate puts a ceiling on deviations from covered interest parity, and finds evidence for it in the data. Third, from the perspective of the macroeconomic effects of policy, it shows that the swap line ex ante encourages inflows from recipient-country banks into assets denominated in the source-country’s currency by reducing the ex post funding risk. We find support for these predictions using difference-in-difference empirical strategies that exploit the fact that only some currencies saw changes in the terms of their dollar swap line, only some bonds in banks’ investments are exposed to dollar funding risk, only some dollar bonds are significantly traded by foreign banks, and only some banks have a significant US presence."

Nevertheless, the treatment of this type of transaction under the leverage ratio (LR) requirement does not allow for the use of initial margin to reduce the exposure, thereby increasing capital costs. As a result, LR affected clearing member banks may be more reluctant to provide central clearing services to clients given this additional cost. This in turn can prevent some real economy firms from hedging their risks. We analyse whether this is the case by exploiting detailed confidential transaction and portfolio level data as well as the introduction and posterior tightening of the LR in the UK in a diff-in-diff framework. Our results suggest that the LR had a disincentivising effect on client clearing, both in terms of daily transactions as well as the number of clients, but this impact seems to be driven by a reduced willingness to take on new clients."

This paper takes a common-factor approach to the analysis of the interaction between uncertainty and economic activity in a multi-country model without a priori restricting the direction of causality at the level of individual countries. Motivated by the observation that cross-country correlations of volatility series are much higher than cross-country correlations of GDP growth series, we set up a multi-country version of the Lucas tree model with time-varying volatility consistent with this stylized fact and use it to identify two common factors, a real and a financial one. We then quantify the absolute and the relative importance of the common shocks as well as country-specific volatility and GDP growth shocks. The paper highlights three main empirical findings. First, it is shown that most of the unconditional correlation between volatility and growth can be accounted for by shocks to the real common factor, which is extracted from world growth in our empirical model and linked to the risk-free rate in the theoretical model and in the data. Second, the share of volatility forecast error variance explained by the real common shock and by country-specific growth shocks amounts to less than 5%. Third, common financial shocks explain about 10% of the growth forecast error variance, but when such shocks occur, their negative impact on growth is large and persistent. In contrast, country-specific volatility shocks account for less than 1%-2% of the forecast error variance decomposition of country-specific growth rates."

However, the elasticity with regard to linguistic and historical variables does remain constant. Alongside macro variables commonly used in the literature, we also find a significant role for expected GDP growth.

It studies sectoral balance sheet dynamics at the point of an initial CBDC introduction, and of an attempted large-scale run out of bank deposits into CBDC. We find that if the introduction of CBDC follows a set of core principles, bank funding is not necessarily reduced, credit and liquidity provision to the private sector need not contract, and the risk of a system-wide run from bank deposits to CBDC is addressed. The core principles are: (i) CBDC pays an adjustable interest rate. (ii) CBDC and reserves are distinct, and not convertible into each other. (iii) No guaranteed, on-demand convertibility of bank deposits into CBDC at commercial banks (and therefore by implication at the central bank). (iv) The central bank issues CBDC only against eligible securities (principally government securities). The final two principles imply that households and firms can freely trade bank deposits against CBDC in a private market, and that the private market can freely obtain additional CBDC from the central bank, at the posted CBDC interest rate and against eligible securities."

We additionally extract information on the volatility of the series to be predicted, since volatility is forecast-relevant under non-quadratic loss functions. To ensure asymptotic unbiasedness of forecasts under the relevant loss, we estimate the predictive regression by minimizing the in-sample average loss. Finally, to select the most promising predictors for the series to be forecast, we employ an information criterion tailored to the relevant loss. Using a large monthly data set for the US economy, we assess the proposed adjustments in a pseudo out-of-sample forecasting exercise for various variables. As expected, the use of estimation under the relevant loss is effective. Using an additional volatility proxy as predictor and conducting model selection tailored to the relevant loss function enhances forecast performance significantly."

 """,2018.,A new approach for detecting shifts in forecast accuracy,"721, Bank of England.","Forecasts play a critical role at inflation-targeting central banks, such as the Bank of England. Breaks in the forecast performance of a model can potentially incur important policy costs. Commonly used statistical procedures, however, implicitly put a lot of weight on type I errors (or false positives), which result in a relatively low power of tests to identify forecast breakdowns in small samples. We develop a procedure which aims at capturing the policy cost of missing a break. We use data-based rules to find the test size that optimally trades off the costs associated with false positives with those that can result from a break going undetected for too long. In so doing, we also explicitly study forecast errors as a multivariate system. The covariance between forecast errors for different series, though often overlooked in the forecasting literature, not only enables us to consider testing in a multivariate setting but also increases the test power. As a result, we can tailor the choice of the critical values for each series not only to the in-sample properties of each series but also to how the series for forecast errors covary."

This has always been true, but given the unprecedented period of accommodative policy in a number of advanced economies including the UK over the past decade, it has become more important to understand the size and direction of these effects. We use panel data from the ONS Wealth and Assets Survey on households’ characteristics and balance sheet positions to estimate the distributional impacts of UK monetary policy between 2008 and 2014. Our results suggest that the overall effect of monetary policy on standard relative measures of income and wealth inequality has been small. Given the pre-existing disparities in income and wealth, we estimate that the impact on each household varied substantially across the income and wealth distributions in cash terms, but in percentage terms the effects were broadly similar. We estimate that households around retirement age gained the most from the support to wealth, but that support to incomes disproportionately benefited the young. Overall, our results illustrate the importance of taking a broad-based approach to studying the distributional impacts of monetary policy and of considering channels jointly rather than in isolation."

Evidence that US monetary and financial developments entered into the Bank’s reaction function implies that a Bank Rate series must include some endogenous rate changes. In order to clean Bank Rate of such movements the narrative approach is applied to a previously unexploited source in the Bank’s archives, ‘The Record of Outstanding Events’. The Bank also followed a known rule of adjusting Bank Rate to preserve its reserves to liabilities ratio. Bank Rate is also cleaned of the contemporaneous impact of this ratio in order to control for any reflex policy movements that could have been anticipated. This ensures that only true monetary policy shocks to the United States are identified. Estimates derived from this new measure indicate that although the Bank was able, via abrupt rate rises, to attract gold to the United Kingdom and replenish its reserves ratio, it was not responsible for causing or aggravating US crises. This result runs counter to conventional wisdom in the literature and contradicts the hypothesis that many US financial crises extended directly back to Threadneedle Street."

We construct firm-specific measures of the cost of capital and uncertainty and use new UK survey data to estimate firm-specific investment hurdle rates. There is substantial variation in the cost of capital and uncertainty faced by firms and we find both matter for investment. Firm heterogeneity might help explain the difference in firms’ investment paths shortly after the Great Recession. This suggests that, while common shocks, that is, aggregate uncertainty matters, it is also important to capture firm-specific uncertainty to better explain investment dynamics. Overall, between 2000 and 2015 investment responded relatively sluggishly to the cost of capital and more sharply to uncertainty, especially after the financial crisis. There are implications for monetary and macroeconomic policy. The relative importance of measures that alleviate uncertainty compared to changes in monetary policy rates could be larger than generally recognised."

We use the DSGE model priors to determine the moments of an independent Normal-Wishart prior for the VAR parameters. Two hyper-parameters control the tightness of the DSGE-implied priors on the autoregressive coefficients and the residual covariance matrix respectively. Determining these hyper-parameters by selecting the values that maximize the marginal likelihood of the Bayesian VAR provides a method for isolating subsets of DSGE parameter priors that are at odds with the data. We illustrate the ability of our approach to correctly detect incorrect DSGE priors for the variance of structural shocks using a Monte Carlo experiment. We also demonstrate how posterior estimates of the DSGE parameter vector can be recovered from the BVAR posterior estimates: a new ‘quasi-Bayesian’ DSGE estimation. An empirical application on US data reveals economically meaningful differences in posterior parameter estimates when comparing our quasi-Bayesian estimator with Bayesian maximum likelihood. Our method also indicates that the DSGE prior implications for the residual covariance matrix are at odds with the data.

Using proprietary data on stress-test submissions from the Bank of England, we develop a measure of firm-level shocks to regulatory constraints that is plausibly exogenous to shifts in insurance demand. We find that constrained firms reduced underwriting relative to unconstrained firms, particularly for traditional insurance products which became more capital intensive in the new regulatory regime. The reduction in underwriting was not as pronounced for linked products, products that are mainly investment vehicles like mutual funds, implying a shift in the equilibrium product mix from traditional to linked. We also show that a higher proportion of constrained firms restructured their balance sheets by transferring assets and liabilities and went through reorganizations ie a change in legal owner of the firm."

Identification is based on the close relationship between low long-term interest rates and pension deficits; and the external regulation of pension schemes by The Pensions Regulator. We show that firms with larger pension deficits voluntarily pay lower dividends, but they do not invest less. However, firms that are required to make deficit recovery contributions by the regulator have lower dividend and investment expenditure compared to other firms, and more so if they are financially constrained.

A hybrid valuation regime, intended to address these unfavourable outcomes, does not strictly dominate the other two regimes.

This model also forecasts mortgage default rates accurately and parsimoniously. The model generates value-at-risk estimates for future mortgage default rates, which can be used to inform stress-testing and macroprudential policy."

Our metrics also have predictive power for other commonly used measures of sentiment and volatility and appear to influence economic and financial variables. And we develop a new methodology that attempts to capture the emergence of narrative topic consensus which gives an intuitive representation of increasing homogeneity of beliefs prior to the crisis.

Having disaggregated information on the stock of mortgages allows policymakers to analyse particular cohorts of the market that may be more vulnerable to stress, and model how these cohorts may evolve in the future and might affect the outlook for financial and economic stability. To this end, we produce the first ever estimate of the current stock of all regulated UK mortgages at the level of individual loans using data from the flow of new mortgages. We use loan-level information of 14 million UK mortgages at the point each loan was originated or re-mortgaged. Using a series of algorithms from Computer Science, we identify individual loans in the flow of lending that are likely to be still in the stock at different points in time. Then we estimate how key characteristics of mortgages (including borrower incomes, house prices and outstanding loan amounts) are likely to have evolved over time since origination. We validate our overall model by comparing key variables to information available from other sources that provide partial characteristics of the stock, including household surveys and regulatory returns. Our stock estimate suggests that there may have been more vulnerable borrowers in recent years than household surveys suggest. Finally, we illustrate the type of cohort analysis that can be done using the loan-level estimate."

We identify the impact of uncertainty shocks using narrative sign restrictions, which allow us to exploit individual historic events to separate the impact of macroeconomic, financial and credit shocks on real variables. Using only traditional sign restrictions, we find that the real effects of macroeconomic uncertainty shocks are generally weaker than proxies suggest and that the effects depend on a subsequent rise in financial uncertainty and credit spreads to have a negative impact on GDP. Exploiting narrative events such as the disorderly exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the dot-com recession and the financial crisis support this finding. However, conditioning on narrative events more closely associated with political uncertainty, ie tight general elections, suggests a stronger impact response of GDP to macro uncertainty shocks.

Besides retained earnings and bank loans, I focus on the crucial role played by alternative sources of funding, including family, friends, non-listed equity and informal banking institutions. While small young enterprises face important difficulties to finance their investment, these alternative financing sources allow them to partially bypass credit constraints. The model can account for the financing patterns observed in Chinese data. Despite an increase in non-performing loans by 11%, liberalizing the banking sector increases the steady-state aggregate level of capital by 10% and the steady-state aggregate production by 5%, inducing efficiency gains and a welfare increase of 1.8%. Selectively tightening the regulation of the alternative finance sector, if simultaneous to bank liberalization, may prevent the rise in non-performing loans while preserving most welfare improvements.

We identify monetary policy and financial shocks by combining the external instruments approach with sign restrictions in a two-country SVAR for the United States and the United Kingdom. Adverse US financial shocks trigger a sharp and persistent contraction in the US economy, and an increase in US credit spreads. Crucially, this tightening in US credit conditions is quickly transmitted internationally, leading to an increase in credit spreads and a slowdown in economic activity in the United Kingdom. Unlike financial shocks, monetary policy shocks do not seem to induce as much international co-movement.

The archival data we use provides granular, loan-level insight on the price and quantity of credit, and information on its distribution to particular counterparties. We find that the Bank’s behaviour during this period broadly conforms to Bagehot’s rule, though with variation across the crises of 1847, 1857 and 1866. Using a new, higher frequency series on the Bank’s balance sheet, we find that the Bank did lend freely, with the number of discounts and advances increasing during crises. These loans were typically granted at a rate above pre-crisis levels and, in 1857 and 1866, typically at a spread above Bank Rate, though we also find some instances in the daily discount ledgers where individual loans were made below Bank rate in 1847. Another set of customer ledgers shows that the securities the Bank purchased were debts owed by a geographically and industrially diverse set of debtors. And using new data on the Bank’s income and dividends, we find the Bank and its shareholders profited from lender of last resort operations.

It examines a number of estimates both of the cost of trading, and the price impact of executed transactions. These include a variant of the ‘volatility over volume’ measure of liquidity based on transaction data, which provides a better proxy of illiquidity — as given by measures based on high-frequency limit order book data — than other summary measures of price impact. The paper also shows that the fall in the value of sterling during the initial part of the flash episode was consistent with the estimated impact on prices of a large number of individually small — but in aggregate large — volume of orders to sell sterling during a normally quiet period of the trading day. However, the subsequent change in price was larger than that consistent with the estimated impact on prices of observed orders to sell sterling. This might support the suggestion, which was included in the report on the episode provided by the Bank for International Settlements, that the move in sterling may have been amplified by the pause in trading on the CME futures exchange."

On this basis, we establish for the first time a long-term comparative investigation of ‘bond bull markets’. It is shown that the global risk-free rate in July 2016 reached its lowest nominal level ever recorded. The current bond bull market in US Treasuries which originated in 1981 is currently the third longest on record, and the second most intense. The second part of this paper presents three case studies for the 20th century, to typify modern forms of bond market reversals. It is found that fundamental, inflation-led bond market reversals have inflicted the longest and most intense losses upon investors, as exemplified by the 1960s market in US Treasuries. However, central bank (mis-) communication has played a key role in the 1994 ‘Bond massacre’. The 2003 Japanese ‘VaR shock’ demonstrates how curve steepening dynamics can create positive externalities for the banking system in periods of monetary policy and financial uncertainty. The paper finally argues that the inflation dynamics underlying the 1965–70 bond market sell-off in US Treasuries could hold particular relevance for the current market environment."

Dealer banks clear the market by being net sellers. However, we find evidence for this behaviour reversing in times of stress for some investors. During the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’, asset managers were net sellers of corporate bonds in response to a sharp rise in yields, potentially amplifying price changes. At the same time, dealer banks were net buyers. Finally, we provide evidence that insurers, hedge funds and asset managers tilt their portfolios towards higher risk bonds, consistent with ‘reaching for yield’ behaviour."

The spillover caused a drop in the supply of household credit in Mexico. Municipalities with a higher exposure to Spanish subsidiaries experienced a larger contraction in household credit. These localized contractions caused a drop in macroeconomic activity in the local non-tradable sector. Estimates of the elasticity of loan-demand by the non-tradable sector to changes in household credit supply range from 1.6–3.5. These results emphasize the potential for cross-border effects of regulations in the presence of global banks.

Focusing on financial interconnections and other balance sheet characteristics as a transmission mechanism, we find that both of these factors play an important role in the transmission of foreign monetary policy. We are able to establish evidence for both a bank funding and bank portfolio channel of monetary policy, for both Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. There are important differences between the two countries; in particular, the currency denomination of lending appears to play a major role only in the United Kingdom, which probably reflects Hong Kong’s linked exchange rate system by which the HK dollar is pegged with the US dollar. These results contrast to the largely inconclusive results from previous studies, whose aggregate nature may have masked offsetting individual bank effects."

We then document empirically, in a Panel VAR model for 50 advanced and emerging countries estimated with quarterly data from 1985 to 2012, that an increase in the leverage of US Broker-Dealers also leads to an increase in cross-border credit flows, a house price and consumption boom, a real exchange rate appreciation and a current account deterioration consistent with the transmission in the model.

We use firm level accounting data, transaction level house price data and loan level residential mortgage data from the United Kingdom to show that a £1 increase in the value of the residential real estate of a firm’s directors increases the firm’s investment and wage bill by £0.03 each. These effects run through smaller firms and are similar in booms and busts. In aggregate, the homes of firm directors are worth 80% of GDP. Using this, a back of the envelope calculation suggests that a 1% increase in real estate prices leads, through this channel, to up to a 0.28% rise in business investment and a 0.08% rise in total wages paid. We complement this with evidence on how a firm responds to changes in the value of its own corporate real estate; we find that, in aggregate, the residential real estate of directors is at least as important for activity. We use an estimated general equilibrium model to quantify the importance of both types of real estate for the propagation of shocks to the macroeconomy."

Purchases of long-term debt by the central bank (quantitative easing; ‘QE’) alter the average portfolio return and hence influence aggregate demand and inflation. The central bank chooses the short-term policy rate and QE to minimise a welfare-based loss function under discretion. Adoption of QE is rapid, with large-scale asset purchases triggered when the policy rate hits the zero bound, consistent with observed policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis. Optimal exit is gradual. Despite the presence of portfolio adjustment costs, a policy of ‘permanent QE’ in which the central bank holds a constant stock of long-term bonds does not improve welfare."

As such, a high degree of tiering is often perceived as being associated with credit and operational risks. In this paper we use data around five recent de-tiering events in the United Kingdom’s LVPS(CHAPS), to assess the impact of de-tiering on these risks as well as on liquidity usage. We find that the impact of de-tiering is largest on credit risk, where average intraday exposures between first and second-tier banks drop by anywhere between £0.3 billion and £1.5 billion per bank, while the cost of insuring against losses arising from these exposures drops by about £4 million to £19 million per bank, per year. On the other hand, the impact of these de-tiering events on operational risk and liquidity usage appears to be economically small."

After discussing the precise form of the competition objective and its background, we consider how best it should be interpreted and implemented. Amongst other points we argue that (i) secondary objectives should be seen as mechanisms for forcing, or at least encouraging, co-ordination across agencies and therefore such objectives have a significant role to play in this context, (ii) that time and proportionality are the key dimensions that provide discretion to pursue primary and secondary objectives, (iii) that there is nothing overtly special about competition as a second best tool when it comes to mitigating risk in the absence of good prudential regulation, and (iv) if prudential regulation is set at the same time that the competition objective is ‘in play’, then the conflict between stability and competition tends to disappear, although some ‘tension’ remains at the margins."

 """,2017.,Borderline: judging the adequacy of return distribution estimation techniques in initial margin models,"673, Bank of England.","The advent of mandatory central clearing for certain types of over-the-counter derivatives and margin requirements for others means that margin is the most important mitigation mechanism for many counterparty credit risks. Initial margin requirements are typically calculated using risk-based margin models, and these models must be tested to ensure that they are prudent. However, two different margin models can calculate substantially different levels of margin yet both pass the usual tests. This paper presents a new approach to parameter selection based on the statistical properties of the worst loss over a margin period of risk estimated by the margin model under test. This measure is related to risk estimated at a fixed confidence interval yet leads to a more powerful test which is better able to justify the choice of parameters used in margin models. The test proposed is used on a variety of volatility estimation techniques applied to a long history of returns of the S&P 500 index. Well known techniques, including exponentially weighted moving average volatility estimation and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity approaches are considered, and novel approaches derived from signal processing are also analysed. In each case a range of model parameters which give rise to acceptable risk estimates is identified."

Because differences between central bank’s and private agents’ information sets affect private agents’ interpretation of policy decisions, this paper aims to investigate whether the publication of macroeconomic information by the central bank modifies private responses to monetary policy. We assess the non-linear effects of monetary shocks conditional on the Bank of England’s macroeconomic projections on UK private inflation expectations. We find that inflation projections modify the impact of monetary shocks. When contractionary monetary shocks are interacted with positive(negative) projections, the negative effect of policy on inflation expectations is amplified (reduced). This suggests that providing guidance about central bank future expected inflation helps private agents’ information processing, and therefore changes their response to policy decisions."

Our main conclusions are that: i) DLT has the potential to improve efficiency and reduce costs in securities settlement, but the technology is still evolving and it is uncertain at this point what form, if any, a DLT-based solution for securities settlement will ultimately take, ii) technological innovation in the post-trade industry is more likely to achieve its potential with some degree of co-ordination which could be facilitated by the relevant authorities, and iii) if DLT-based securities settlement becomes a reality, then it is likely to be concentrated among few providers which, in the absence of regulation, could result in inefficient monopoly pricing or efficient price discrimination with service providers capturing much of the market surplus."

Under our assumptions regarding bidders’ behaviour, although the revenue of the portfolio by the CCP might be the same for these auction formats mentioned above, there could be significant differences in the externalities arising from each of them. Additionally, this paper considers how mechanisms to incentivize competitive bidding could, in some circumstances, have adverse implications for financial stability by inefficiently distributing losses to surviving clearing members. In response to these potential adverse implications, we propose a fourth auction type — second price with loss sharing — which takes into account a bidder’s consideration that may bear part of the CCP’s losses."

In the first age of international financial integration (1871–1914), the global reserve currency was the British pound sterling. Whether the United Kingdom enjoyed a similar privilege is analysed with a new dataset, encompassing microdata on railroad and government financial securities. The use of microdata avoids the flaws that have plagued the US studies, particularly the use of incompatible aggregate variables. A monthly proxy for the British international investment position is constructed and estimates for capital gains and dividend yields obtained. The estimation points to an average privilege of 8.3% of GDP, with high variation. The finding supports the claim that in part exorbitant privilege is a general characteristic of the issuer of the global reserve currency and not unique to the late twentieth century US. Nonetheless, a decomposition of returns shows that there were fundamental differences between pre-war Britain and the late twentieth century US investment patterns and their response to the advantage presented by exorbitant privilege."

We augment a state space representation of the aggregate matching function with a measure of job seekers’ ‘search intensity’ that is recovered from micro-data on individual unemployment-to-employment transitions, in line with recent developments in the literature. The baseline results show that matching efficiency declined by around 15% between 1995 and 2010 but subsequently recovered by about 5 percentage points in the last six years. Compositional changes in the labour force that improved aggregate search intensity prior to the 2008 recession will tend to obscure the decline in aggregate matching efficiency unless controlled for properly. Considering broader definitions of job seekers that include marginally-attached workers and on-the-job searchers exacerbates the registered decline in matching efficiency. Changes in ‘recruiting intensity’ and the share of vacancies posted by different industries provide a potential explanation for some, but not all, of the initial fall in matching efficiency that preceded the 2007–08 recession. Finally, we quantitatively analyse how labour force heterogeneity and changes in matching efficiency have affected the shape and location of the UK Beveridge Curve."

However, because of adverse income and valuation effects from real depreciation, the escape can be beggar thy self, raising employment but actually lowering welfare. We show that as long as the economy remains financially open, domestic asset supply policies or reducing the effective lower bound on policy rates may be ineffective or even counterproductive. However, closing domestic capital markets does not necessarily enhance the monetary authorities’ ability to rescue the economy from stagnation."

The framework considers two distinct dealer functions: that of provider of repo financing (to prospective bond market participants) and that of market-maker. The cost and ability of dealers to provide these services under different regulatory constraints determines the price impact of a given trade on the market — or the level of ‘market liquidity premia’. In the model the impact on market liquidity varies for different levels of market volatility or ‘stress’. We find that under normal market conditions estimates of corporate bond liquidity risk premia are higher under the new regulations, but also that corporate bond market liquidity is more resilient due to better-capitalised dealers continuing to intermediate markets under higher levels of market stress than pre-crisis. Mapping these changes in liquidity premia to GDP, via their impact on the cost of borrowing for corporates in the real economy, the results of the model suggest that under normal market conditions there may be a greater cost of regulation via corporate bond markets than incorporated in earlier studies. However, once offset against the benefits of greater dealer resilience, including the benefits to market functioning, there remain net benefits to new regulations."

To do so, it sets out a structural model of firms’ equity to assess their investment behaviour under different regulatory regimes. It finds that, while Solvency II may partly protect insurers’ solvency positions from falls in risky asset prices, the new regulations might encourage certain types of UK life insurers to de-risk — that is, move to holding safe assets in place of risky — following falls in risk-free interest rates. This behaviour is driven by changes in the so-called ‘risk margin’, which, under its current design within the Solvency II framework, reduces insurers’ solvency positions following falls in risk-free interest rates, thereby encouraging them to sell risky assets to reduce their probability of regulatory insolvency. The model also suggests that, once Solvency II is fully implemented by 2032, UK life insurers may have markedly reduced their holdings of long-term, risky assets. In the model, this behaviour is also driven by the risk margin, which, by increasing the volatility of insurers’ solvency, encourages them to de-risk to reduce the variance of their asset portfolios."

This econometric study provides evidence of both the long and short-term implications for ongoing activity in the UK economy of a change in the aggregate proportion of bank capital funding. We find that, in response to changes in their capital funding, banks change credit spreads applied to private non-financial corporate borrowers to a greater extent than for household borrowers in the short term, but equalise these changes in the longer term. The short-term impact reflects banks’ desire to adjust their capital ratios through changes to the value of their risk-weighted assets by restricting the flow of lending to higher-risk sectors to a greater extent than to lower-risk sectors. We also find that after recent regulatory reforms banks may have modified their price-setting behaviour somewhat. We develop a vector error correction model of these effects with an innovative non-standard estimation of the short-term coefficients. Using this approach, we are able to: (i) test hypotheses about the short-term and long-term responses to changes in the aggregate mix of bank capital funding; (ii) test hypotheses about the responses of the non-financial corporate and household sectors; and (iii) enhance the accuracy of the short-term dynamics and the accuracy of the macroeconomic simulations of the effect of increasing bank capital."

We apply our model to a unique data set of real UK interbank exposures. We show that risks due to solvency contagion decrease markedly from the peak of the crisis to the present, to the point of becoming negligible. By decomposing the change in losses into two main contributions — the increase in banks’ capital and the decrease in interbank exposures — we are able to pinpoint the main driver in each year. In some cases we observe that an increase in aggregate capital is associated with a positive contribution to losses. This suggests that the distribution of capital among banks is also important."

In addition to GDP we examine other metrics of severity, including unemployment and labour productivity. We find that a period of rapid credit growth in the immediate run-up to a recession predicts a deeper and longer downturn than when credit growth has been subdued, whether associated with a systemic banking crisis or not and whether that credit growth reflects borrowing by households or businesses. Credit growth is a more statistically and economically significant predictor of a recession’s severity than the level of indebtedness, though there is some evidence that the effect of a credit boom is greater when leverage is high. A build-up in credit predicts worse recessions in terms of lower GDP per capita, higher unemployment and lost labour productivity."

 """,2017.,The role of foreign banks in trade,"656, Bank of England.","This paper provides new insights into how financial globalization relates to international trade. Exploiting unique, time-varying, bilateral data on foreign bank ownership for many countries, we show that, for emerging markets, greater local foreign bank presence, especially from the importing country, is associated with higher exports in sectors more dependent on external finance. The association does not arise for advanced countries and is stronger when institutions are weaker. The presence of a bank from the importing country is also associated with higher exports in sectors with more opaque products. Results are robust to controlling for domestic financial development and a full set of fixed effects. An event study confirms findings and shows impacts to be more pronounced when a foreign bank enters through an M&A. Imports also increase after entry, but less so. Overall, results suggest that foreign banks facilitate trade in emerging markets by increasing the availability of external finance and helping overcome information asymmetries."

Modern models of the term structure of interest rates typically fail to capture jointly time and cross-curve dependencies and are not used for stress-testing purposes. Our methodology is able to jointly model the temporal and cross-country dependence structure of interest rate curves and associate movements in the interest rates and cross-country spreads with movements in macroeconomic variables as well as market-wide and country-specific measures of liquidity and credit quality. We apply our methodology to generate contemporaneous stressed scenarios to a set of European yield curves. Motivated by the recent eurozone debt crisis, we apply shocks to Italian and Spanish liquidity and credit variables and evaluate the impact of these shocks on several bond portfolio strategies. The empirical findings suggest that both country-specific liquidity and credit measures are important in explaining the dynamic behaviour of European sovereign interest rate curves and their dependence structure. Nevertheless, their importance varies across time, shock types and investment horizons."

We use a simple New Keynesian model to demonstrate that a forward guidance announcement to delay lift-off may be no more powerful in a more interest rate sensitive economy. We also demonstrate that attempts to delay lift-off further may fail to generate additional stimulus if the temptation to renege on the announcement is sufficiently great. In an empirical application, we consider counterfactual policy experiments based on the Federal Open Market Committee’s ‘threshold-based’ forward guidance, in which we link the probability of lift-off to the amount by which the announced unemployment threshold is breached. We show that a more precise articulation of the lift-off conditions requires a lower unemployment threshold in order to deliver the same amount of stimulus as a less precise one."

Post-crisis lending to business is also sensitive to the riskiness of banks’ mortgage portfolios. Banks having more mortgages to borrowers with impaired credit history, or more mortgages to the self-employed, or mortgages with higher loan to value ratios prior to the crisis reduced their lending to non-financial businesses more."

We find limited evidence that capital ratios are lower at institutions engaging in Level 3 trading activities for given risk levels, consistent with opportunistic behaviour. We also find that market discipline, as measured by whether an institution has a US stock exchange listing or dependence on short-term, uninsured funding sources, is effective in moderating this behaviour. At these institutions capital ratios are higher, consistent with there being a direct (ex ante) disciplining effect on bank behaviour."

The procedures ensure the regularity of the settlement process through the prudent and orderly closeout of the defaulter’s portfolio. Traditional approaches to CCPs’ margin requirements typically assume a simple closeout profile, and do not account for the ‘real-life’ constraints embedded on the management of a default. The paper proposes an approach of evaluating how distinct closeout strategies may expose a CCP to different sets of risk and costs, and consequently could impact the sufficiency of financial resources to cover its risk exposure to a default. The approach is based on a counterfactual simulation, and evaluates a full spectrum of hedging strategies in an exploratory and model-free manner, deriving endogenous and market-dependent risk metrics. Using the trade repository data available to the Bank (as a result of EMIR reporting) on over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps (IRS) and ten years (ie 2005 to 2015) of information on related market risk factors, the paper derives empirically an efficient hedging strategy that minimizes the CCP’s risk exposure to a defaulting clearing member. Endogenous trade-off structures between total risk (market risk plus funding needs) and transaction costs are also established, with marginal sensitivities to individual components of the hedging strategy determined."

We find no such effect from losses of non-counterparties, nor from counterparties who have bought protection from, rather than sold protection to, the bank.

The picture has changed dramatically during the recovery, however, with vulnerabilities close to record-highs by end-2015 in some of the Asian economies. We document numerous practical challenges that arise when developing such a toolkit, the main one being to know the trend — the ‘neutral’ level — of a financial variable (for example credit-to-GDP). In that context, one important contribution of this paper is to document the robustness of vulnerability measures to different judgements about the trend level of financial variables. We find that for most countries results are fairly robust to different views of the underlying trend, but importantly that this robustness is not universal. In particular, at the moment differing views of what ‘the new normal’ is suggest dramatically different assessments of the level of fragility in the United States and South Korea."

However, the effects of capital requirements on lending and risk-weighted asset growth both before and after the crisis are similar.

Second, we take a portmanteau approach and estimate a number of different performance-based competition measures common in the literature to support conclusions on the intensity of competition over the period. Our estimates of the Lerner index, the Panzar-Rosse H-statistic and the Boone indicator suggest that competition intensity was strong at the beginning of our sample, but became less intense in the early 2000s. However, the deposit-taker business model bundles together activities in several markets simultaneously, so strong competition in some markets can be offset by the extraction of market rents in others.

Consolidation induces a positive wealth effect that increases demand, as well as a reallocation of workers towards the private sector, which together boost private activity. However, in a low inflation environment, demand is suppressed and the private sector is not able to absorb the additional workers. Comparing the two instruments, cuts in public hiring increase unemployment persistently in this environment, while wage cuts reduce it. Regions with higher mobility of labour between the two sectors are able to consolidate more effectively. Price flexibility is also key at the zero lower bound: for a higher degree of price rigidity in the Periphery, consolidation becomes harder to achieve. Consolidations can be self-defeating when the public good is productive, or a complement to private consumption."

Because private sector forecasts are not bound to be equal to central banks’ forecasts, what markets label as unexpected may or may not be unanticipated by the central bank. Monetary surprises can thus incorporate anticipatory effects if market participants fail to correctly account for the systematic component of policy when they are surprised by an interest rate decision. Depending on how market participants perceive the policy decision, their economic projections and the associated risk compensations move in opposite directions, and do so at the time of the announcement. Hence, and regardless of the width of the measurement window, monetary surprises capture more than just the monetary policy shock, and their use as external instruments for identification is potentially compromised. Monetary ‘surprises’ are dependent on, and shown to be predictable by both central banks’ forecasts and past information available to market participants prior to the announcement. A New-Keynesian framework sketches the intuition. The resulting distortions in the estimated impulse response functions can be dramatic, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A new set of monetary surprises, free of anticipatory effects and unpredictable by past information, are shown to retrieve transmission coefficients to a monetary policy shock consistent with macroeconomic theory even in informationally deficient VARs."

This paper documents differences in the levels of application of prudential requirements drawing on a survey of national rules and regulations in eight jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions apply prudential requirements on a consolidated basis, meaning that they require groups to meet standards for minimum capital and liquidity adequacy as if they constituted a single financial unit. However, consolidated requirements do not account for potential impediments to the transferability of financial resources within banking groups. Reflecting this, international banking standards suggest prudential requirements should be applied also at lower levels. The Basel Accord sets out two alternatives for applying prudential requirements beneath the consolidated level: solo application and sub-consolidation. Solo application involves applying prudential standards to individual operating banks within a group, as if those banks were separate standalone entities; sub-consolidation involves regulating sub-groupings of entities as if those sub-groupings were themselves a single financial unit. These approaches have differing implications with respect to the allocation of financial resources across the legal entities within banking groups. However, in practice different jurisdictions arrive at similar outcomes through their differentiated application of certain other regulations, notably restrictions on intragroup exposures. The final part of the paper considers how forthcoming standards on bank resolution affect the economic rationales for sub-consolidated and solo application of prudential requirements."

The aim of this paper is to quantify the short-run fiscal costs and long-run fiscal benefits of reforms, and investigate how the design of reforms can affect this trade-off. The focus is on the euro area, which has been particularly affected by high unemployment. In the model, both the costs and benefits of reforms are generally small, although increasingly large reforms entail larger rises in deficit-to-GDP in the short run. Results suggest that reforms in labour markets have little effect on public finances in the long run, but their short-run costs can be ameliorated by combining them with product market reforms."

This approach enables us to tackle the heterogeneity in this market by modelling the individual behaviour and interactions of first-time buyers, home owners, buy-to-let investors, and renters from the bottom up, and observe the resulting aggregate dynamics in the property and credit markets. The model is calibrated using a large selection of micro-data, mostly from household surveys and housing market data sources. We perform a series of comparative statics exercises to investigate the impact of the size of the rental/buy-to-let sector and different types of buy-to-let investors on housing booms and busts. The results suggest that an increase in the size of the buy-to-let sector may amplify house price cycles and increase house price volatility. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the effects of macroprudential policies on several housing market indicators, we implement a loan-to-income portfolio limit. We find that this policy attenuates the house price cycle."

Compared to diversified banks, local banks (i) originate a higher share of new mortgage and small business loans in affected areas, but (ii) sell a higher share of the new mortgages into the secondary market. These results suggest a pattern of specialization, whereby loans in affected areas are increasingly originated by banks with special abilities or incentives to seize opportunities in a distressed market, but increasingly transferred to agents which can better support the associated risk."

The only identifying assumption is that this λ-shock demands the highest risk price per unit of exposure, or equivalently, minimises the associated sum of squared pricing errors, when pricing a given asset portfolio. When applying the method to the stock portfolios studied by Fama-French, a robust economic feature of the λ-shock is the delayed effect on aggregate quantities such as output and consumption and a sharp impact on the short-term interest rate and the term spread. The estimated λ-shock bears strong resemblance both with monetary policy shocks and with technology news shocks studied by the macroeconomic literature."

The prediction is identical in response to purely common shocks in the same model augmented with simple country heterogeneity (eg, where depreciation rates or factor shares are different across countries). This happens because common shocks have heterogeneous consequences on the marginal products of capital across countries, which triggers international investment. In the data, filtering out common shocks requires therefore allowing for country-specific loadings. We show that finance and synchronization correlate negatively in response to such common shocks, consistent with previous findings.

For each of the models, we estimate regimes which carry the interpretation of recessionary/normal and financially stressful/stable periods. Using the recursiveness assumption and conditional on shocks of one standard deviation, we show that (i) financial shocks hitting during times of recessions create disproportionately more severe contractions in output; (ii) output growth shocks hitting in financially stressful times result in disproportionately further financial stress; (iii) monetary policy shocks hitting in recessionary times create more severe contractions in output. We also demonstrate the power of a feedback loop between real and financial sectors when extremely large shocks hit the economy in normal/financially stable periods. Afterwards, we perform out-of-sample forecasting exercises, and find that the threshold VAR model has the potential to predict tail events in conditional forecasting. Overall, our findings provide strong evidence of nonlinearities and shock amplification mechanisms in the UK data, as well as empirical support to the theoretical findings of Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014)."

We can only fix this shortcoming in a historical laboratory. The Radcliffe Report (1959), notoriously sceptical about the efficacy of monetary policy, embodied views which led the United Kingdom to a three-decade experiment of using credit controls alongside conventional changes in the central bank interest rate. These non-price tools are similar to policies now being considered or used by macroprudential policymakers. We describe these tools, document how they were used by the authorities, and craft a new, largely hand-collected dataset to help estimate their effects. We develop a novel identification strategy, which we term Factor-Augmented Local Projection (FALP), to investigate the subtly different impacts of both monetary and macroprudential policies.

But collateral markets also have the potential to exacerbate risks to financial stability, not least given that during periods of market stress demand for high-quality collateral may increase, whilst collateral availability may fall. This paper offers a means to estimate how this potential imbalance between collateral supply and demand is likely to vary as a function of market stress. In doing so, it offers an estimate of the increase in market volatility sufficient to cause a dislocation in the market for collateral and a subsequent deterioration in market functioning. It suggests that — from the perspective of financial stability — the implications of an imbalance between the supply and demand of collateral are likely to be comparatively benign, but that the implications of a reduction in the willingness and/or ability of market participants to act as intermediaries in collateral markets are likely to have more serious consequences for market functioning.

We find no evidence of a relationship between the transitory component of volatility and macroeconomic fundamentals. Instead, we find that the transitory component is more closely associated with changes in investor sentiment. Our results are robust to a wide range of alternative specifications."

At the same time, monetary policy becomes less effective. Therefore, stochastic volatility introduces occasional trade-offs for monetary policy between inflation and output gap stabilisation. The cost-push effects operate through expectational responses to the interaction between shock volatility and the zero lower bound (ZLB) on interest rates. Optimal monetary policy calls for potentially sharp reductions in the interest rate when risk is elevated, even if this risk never materialises. Close to the ZLB, small risk shocks become ‘large’ in this sense. If policy is initially constrained by the ZLB, lift-off is optimally delayed when risk increases."

During this period, gilt market liquidity fluctuates significantly with execution costs almost doubling at the peak of the crisis. Consistent with theory, dealer balance sheet constraints and increased funding costs are significant determinants of illiquidity. However, we document that increased funding costs also negatively impact the inter-dealer segment of the market which leads to a further reduction in liquidity. This is consistent with the notion that the inter-dealer segment enables dealers to share risk and manage their inventories. Additionally, gilt market illiquidity is also influenced by instances of reduced competition among dealers. Both of these effects are more pronounced at the peak of the financial crisis and economically significant: a one standard deviation decrease in the fraction of inter-dealer trading leads to an increase in trading costs of about $700K–$1.5 million daily for non-dealers, and a one standard deviation increase in dealer activity concentration leads to an incremental cost of about $270K–$1 million daily."

For supply shocks, combining macroprudential regulation with a stronger anti-inflationary policy stance is optimal.

 """,2016.,A comparative analysis of tools to limit the procyclicality of initial margin requirements,"597, Bank of England.","The requirement to post initial margin on derivatives transactions is a key feature of the post-crisis reforms of the OTC derivatives markets. Initial margin requirements are usually determined by risk-based models. These models typically require increased margin in stressed conditions: they are procyclical. This procyclicality causes a liquidity burden on market participants which sometimes falls when they are least able to bear it. In this paper we study a variety of tools which have been proposed to mitigate the procyclicality of initial margin requirements. Three of these tools are proposed in European regulation; the other two are new proposals which offer attractive procyclicality mitigation features. The behaviour of all five tools is studied in a simulation framework. We examine the extent to which each tool mitigates procyclicality, and at what cost in demanding unnecessary margin compared to a benchmark unmitigated model. Our findings indicate that all of the tools are useful in mitigating procyclicality to some extent, but that the optimal calibration of each tool in a particular situation depends on the relative weights placed by the modeller on the objectives of minimizing procyclicality on the one hand and minimizing undesirable overmargining in periods of low volatility on the other. This suggests that it may be appropriate to consider moving from tools-based procyclicality regulation to one based on the desired outcomes."

The paper’s originality is in attending to the legal, accounting, statistical, economic and strategic aspects of loan loss provisioning (LLP) and NPLs, topics that are multidisciplinary by nature but have not been dealt with in the literature in an integrated fashion before. Since the 2007 Great Financial Crisis (GFC), accounting bodies and prudential regulators are increasingly focused on early recognition of credit losses and enhanced disclosure.

The model parameters are calibrated against empirical data on US corporate bond trading. Where available, inputs are taken from market data. Others are calibrated through matching statistical features of market returns such as auto-correlations, volatility and fat tails. We use the model to explore the impact of shocks. We find that the sensitivity of the market maker to demand and the degree to which momentum traders are active strongly influence the over and undershooting of yields in response to a shock. This suggests that correlation in funds’ trading strategies can exacerbate extreme price movements and contribute to the procyclicality of financial markets. While the behaviour of investors in funds based on past experience plays a comparatively smaller role in model dynamics, it represents another source of amplification which could be particularly problematic if investors respond to a shock with greater risk aversion. Simple measures to reduce the speed with which investors can redeem investments can reduce the extent of yield dislocation. We also explore the impact of the growth in passive investment, and find that it increases the tail risk of big yield dislocations after shocks, though, on average, volatility may be reduced."

This paper assesses the impact of reforms to the Bank of England’s operating framework over the last two decades. These reforms have been successful in reducing overnight volatility. A new framework in 2006 which introduced reserves averaging and voluntary reserve targets was associated with lower volatility of overnight rates. Further reductions in volatility were associated with interim reforms and communications prior to the launch of this new framework. The injection of excess reserves under the floor system introduced in 2009 has been associated with a further reduction in volatility. Despite these encouraging findings, further analysis shows that the volatility of overnight rates had little effect on the volatility of longer-term rates except in the pre-2006 ‘zero reserves’ period and no effect at all on three-month Libor rates, which are the key benchmark for many derivatives and bank loans. Since longer-term rates are more important than overnight rates for the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy, the results provide limited support for prioritising the reduction of volatility in the design of central banks’ operating frameworks. The results also suggest that additional communication regarding likely future monetary policy decisions is associated with lower volatility of term rates."

Both models overpredicted GDP growth at all forecast horizons, but the BVAR outperformed COMPASS at forecast horizons up to one year ahead. The BVAR’s point and density forecast performance is also comparable to that of a Bank of England in-house statistical suite for both GDP and CPI inflation and to the Inflation Report projections.

 """,2016.,How does labour market structure affect the response of economies to shocks?,"582, Bank of England.","The recent crisis in the Eurozone has led to much discussion about the structure of labour markets in different Eurozone economies. In particular, there has been much talk of the need for structural labour market reform in the Eurozone periphery. But, there are many aspects of labour market structure – eg, wage flexibility, flexibility in hiring and firing, generosity of welfare schemes, etc — and it is not clear a priori which aspects really matter. In this paper, we analyse how cross-country differences in labour market characteristics — in particular, wage and employment rigidities — shape the response of different countries to a variety of macroeconomic shocks. To address this question, we use a calibrated small open economy model in which we set the parameters governing the structural characteristics of the labour market based on three European countries: Estonia, Finland and Spain. We find that, given our labour market calibrations, we would expect output and unemployment to be much more adversely affected by the shocks associated with the financial crisis in countries with high job turnover rates."

 """,2016.,Policy and macro signals as inputs to inflation expectation formation,"581, Bank of England.","How do private agents interpret central bank actions and communication? To what extent do the effects of monetary shocks depend on the information disclosed by the central bank? This paper investigates the effect of monetary shocks and shocks to the Bank of England’s inflation and output projections on the term structure of UK private inflation expectations, to shed light on private agents’ interpretation of central bank signals about policy and the macroeconomic outlook. We proceed in three steps. First, we correct our dependent variables — market-based inflation expectation measures — for potential risk, liquidity and inflation risk premia. Second, we extract exogenous shocks following Romer and Romer (2004)’s identification approach. Third, we estimate the linear and interacted effects of these shocks in an empirical framework derived from the information frictions literature. We find that private inflation expectations respond negatively to contractionary monetary policy shocks, consistent with the usual transmission mechanism. In contrast, we find that inflation expectations respond positively to positive central bank inflation or output projection shocks, suggesting private agents put more weight on the signal that they convey about future economic developments than about the policy outlook. However, when shocks to central bank inflation projections are interacted with shocks to output projections of the same sign, they have no effect on inflation expectations, suggesting that private agents understand the functioning of the central bank reaction function and put more weight on the policy signal when there is no trade-off. We also find that the effects of contractionary monetary shocks are amplified when they are accompanied by positive shocks to central bank inflation projections. The co-ordination of policy decisions and macroeconomic projections thus appears important for managing inflation expectations."

We find that, as a result of SEF trading, activity increases and liquidity improves across the swap market, with the improvement being largest for USD mandated contracts which are most affected by the mandate. The associated reduction in execution costs is economically significant. For example, execution costs in USD mandated contracts, where SEF penetration is highest, drop, for market end-users alone, by $3 million–$4 million daily relative to EUR mandated contracts and in total by about $7 million–$13 million daily. We also find that inter-dealer activity drops concurrently with the improvement in liquidity suggesting that execution costs may have fallen because dealer intermediation chains became shorter. Finally, we document that the Dodd-Frank mandate caused the activity of the EUR segment of the market to geographically fragment. However, this does not appear to have compromised liquidity. Overall, our results suggest that the improvements in transparency brought about by the Dodd-Frank trading mandate have substantially improved interest rate swap market liquidity."

The passthrough of larger bilateral exchange rate movements (ie more than 5%) is around four times larger than that of smaller changes. However, regressions on aggregate data indicate that passthrough at the macro level is close to full. The resolution to this apparent puzzle lies in the fact that larger bilateral movements account for the vast majority of variation in the exchange rate index, and hence the non-linearity at the micro level largely disappears at the macro level."

Meaningful restrictions are imposed on the model parameters, so as to attain local stationarity and bounded mean values. In particular, we consider time variation in both coefficients and volatility, emphasizing how the two interact. The model is applied to the analysis of inflation dynamics. Allowing for heavy tails leads to significant improvements in terms of fit and forecast. The adoption of the Student-t distribution proves to be crucial in order to obtain well-calibrated density forecasts. These results are obtained using US CPI inflation rate and are confirmed for other indicators of inflation as well as the CPI inflation of the other G7 countries. Finally, we show how the proposed approach generalizes various adaptive algorithms used in the literature."

The impact of this time-varying risk aversion proxy on bond risk premia is then analysed within an arbitrage-free term structure model of UK interest rates, where it is introduced explicitly as a pricing factor. By linking VRP to a stochastic discount factor, we find that the risk aversion factor has significantly affected UK government bond yields. The changes in the risk aversion factor have been particularly important in the period of the 2008–09 financial crisis, with medium maturity yields being affected the most."

This paper proposes a tractable Bayesian approach for incorporating prior information about the unconditional means of yields.

This finding is important for monetary policy makers, who are interested in the impact that supply shocks, such as immigration, have on average wages and overall inflation. Our results also reveal that the biggest impact of immigration on wages is within the semi/unskilled services occupational group. We also investigate if there is any differential impact between immigration from the EU and non-EU, and find that there is no additional impact on aggregate UK wages as a result of migrants arriving specifically from EU countries.

 """,2015.,Secular drivers of the global real interest rate,"571, Bank of England.","Long-term real interest rates across the world have fallen by about 450 basis points over the past 30 years. The co-movement in rates across both advanced and emerging economies suggests a common driver: the global neutral real rate may have fallen. In this paper we attempt to identify which secular trends could have driven such a fall. Although there is huge uncertainty, under plausible assumptions we think we can account for around 400 basis points of the 450 basis points fall. Our quantitative analysis highlights slowing global growth as one force that may have pushed down on real rates recently, but shifts in saving and investment preferences appear more important in explaining the long-term decline. We think the global saving schedule has shifted out in recent decades due to demographic forces, higher inequality and to a lesser extent the glut of precautionary saving by emerging markets. Meanwhile, desired levels of investment have fallen as a result of the falling relative price of capital, lower public investment, and due to an increase in the spread between risk-free and actual interest rates. Moreover, most of these forces look set to persist and some may even build further. This suggests that the global neutral rate may remain low and perhaps settle at (or slightly below) 1% in the medium to long run. If true, this will have widespread implications for policymakers — not least in how to manage the business cycle if monetary policy is frequently constrained by the zero lower bound."

Second, when the interest rate is the only available policy instrument, a monetary authority subject to the same constraints as private agents cannot always achieve a (constrained) efficient allocation and faces a trade-off between macroeconomic and financial stability in response to contractionary shocks. An implication of our analysis is that the weak link in the US policy framework in the run up to the Global Recession was not excessively lax monetary policy after 2002, but rather the absence of an effective second policy instrument aimed at preserving financial stability."

 """,2015.,Why are real interest rates so low? Secular stagnation and the relative price of investment goods,"564, Bank of England.","Over the past four decades, real interest rates have risen then fallen across the industrialised world. Over the same period, nominal investment rates fell, while house prices and household debt ratios rose. I explain these four trends with a fifth — the widespread fall in the relative price of investment goods. I present a simple closed-economy OLG model in which households finance retirement in part by selling claims on the corporate sector accumulated over their working lives. With lower capital goods prices, a given quantity of saving buys more capital goods, but the increase in the real capital-output ratio lowers the marginal product. This has ambiguous effects on interest rates in the long run: if capital and labour are complements, in line with most estimates in the literature, interest rates remain low even if the relative price of capital stabilises. Lower interest rates reduce the user cost of housing, raise house prices and, given that housing is bought early in life, increase household debt. Housing is another vehicle for retirement saving, so omitting housing from the model exacerbates the fall in interest rates. I extend the model to allow for bequests and a heterogeneous bequest motive, and show that wealth inequality rises but consumption inequality falls when capital goods prices fall. Adding a third factor of production can reconcile the recent fall in the investment rate with the fall in the labour share. I test the model on cross-country data and find support for its assumptions and predictions. The analysis in this paper shows recent debates on macroeconomic imbalances and household and government indebtedness in a new light. In particular, low real interest rates may be the new normal. The debt of the young provides an alternative outlet for the retirement savings of the old; preventing the accumulation of debt, for example through macroprudential policy, leads to a bigger fall in interest rates."

We assume that the policy maker makes a state-contingent commitment to hold the policy rate at the zero lower bound (ZLB) in a way that ensures that specific macroeconomic variables (eg inflation) do not breach particular ‘thresholds’. In common with other similar policies, threshold-based forward guidance (TBFG) can be used to stimulate the economy at the ZLB via a commitment to hold the policy rate lower-for-longer than would otherwise have been the case. But TBFG also acts as a hedge against the asymmetric effects of shocks. That is because if further adverse shocks arise, prolonging the recession, exit would be expected to occur later and the policy would provide additional stimulus. In contrast, if positive shocks arrive, so that the economy recovers more quickly than originally expected, exit would be expected to occur sooner, thereby removing some of the policy stimulus. This hedging property of TBFG also means that there is a relatively low incentive for policy makers to renege on the policy, unlike lower-for-longer policies that depend purely on calendar time."

The baseline model is an application of the De Long, Shleifer, Summers and Waldmann (1990) model of noise traders to the housing market, when the risky asset is housing. This adds new features to the model as households receive utility from housing services and cannot short-sell houses. The existence of noise traders in the housing market creates uncertainty about house prices, causes prices to deviate away from their fundamental values, and leads to a distortion in housing consumption. To investigate the impact of housing derivatives trading on the housing market, a new financial instrument, housing futures, is introduced into the baseline model. Housing futures trading affects house price stability through three channels: by (i) enabling households to disentangle their housing consumption decisions from investment decisions; (ii) allowing short-selling; and (iii) attracting an additional set of traders (pure speculators) looking for portfolio diversification opportunities. The results show that, for a large set of admissible parameter values, housing futures trading decreases the volatility of house prices and increases the welfare of households and investors when noise trader (sophisticated) households are always relatively optimistic (pessimistic), and the share of pure speculators that are sophisticated is higher than the share of households that are sophisticated."

Moreover, in the United Kingdom inflation-linked market instruments reference RPI inflation, whereas the MPC’s target is CPI inflation of 2%. To better extract useful information about expectations for CPI inflation, we develop a no-arbitrage term structure model to decompose the forward inflation curve into: measures of CPI inflation expectations; the expected spread between expected RPI and CPI inflation (the RPI/CPI inflation ‘wedge’); and estimates of risk premia. We then further decompose risk premia estimates into inflation risk premia and liquidity risk premia. We show that long-horizon expectations of CPI inflation, as implied by our model, fell in the 1990s after the introduction of inflation targeting and the creation of the MPC and have since remained fairly stable at around 2%. Our model also suggests that the large falls in measures of implied inflation based on index-linked gilts after the financial crisis were to a large extent the result of changes in liquidity premia in inflation-linked gilt prices."

We address the question by estimating quadratic term structure models (QTSMs) and shadow rate models (SRMs) with at most four pricing factors. Our findings suggest that QTSMs give a better in-sample fit than SRMs with two and three factors, whereas the SRM marginally dominates with four factors. Loadings from Campbell-Shiller regressions are generally better matched by the SRMs, which also outperform the QTSMs when forecasting bond yields, particularly with four pricing factors."

This paper studies the behaviour of BTL investors using 2009–14 micro data. Combining the universe of transactions from the England and Wales Land Registry with online listings from WhenFresh/Zoopla, I identify a BTL purchase as a transaction where a rental listing on the same property appears on the web in the six subsequent months. The micro data reproduce the increase in BTL transactions over 2009–14 and show that BTL investors are more likely to invest in regions with large rental markets. I find that, on average, BTL investors pay 0.9%–1.1% less than other buyers for equivalent properties. Discounts are larger (around 2%) in regions with less liquid housing markets. Results are robust to including detailed geographical fixed effect and advertised sale prices in the regressions. I also show that properties purchased by investors spend on average five days less on the market."

Their structure and dynamics have, however, changed significantly in recent years. In particular, a number of new banking regulations will affect the behaviour of money market participants, and so have the potential to affect money market interest rates. This paper offers a model to examine how prudential regulation might affect interbank overnight interest rates where the central bank implements monetary policy using a corridor system. Combined with a set of assumptions as to the cost banks might incur in meeting regulatory capital requirements, it offers a framework with which to explore how such prudential regulation might affect the dynamics of overnight interest rates. The results — which are illustrative — estimate the interest rates at which banks might borrow and lend reserves overnight in the presence of prudential regulation. They suggest that risk-weighted capital requirements might increase the average level of overnight interbank interest rates, while the regulatory minimum leverage ratio might decrease it. If applied to real-world data on central bank reserves balances and regulatory metrics, this model also offers an insight into how central bank policymakers could — if they so choose — amend their operational frameworks to account for the effects of regulation."

We find no increase in borrowing from foreign banks after an action which tightens lending standards (such as limits on loan-to-value ratios for house purchase). Evidence on reserve requirements is mixed. Differences in the application of regulation for lending standards and capital regulation for international banks mean that while there is a level playing field for lending standards regulation, this does not always apply for capital regulation, giving foreign branches regulated by their home authorities a competitive advantage. Our results are, at first sight, different from the literature on regulatory arbitrage: we find that foreign banks expand their lending into host countries where regulation is tightened. But this does not occur when regulations apply also to them. The results have implications for macroprudential instrument choice and calibration, and for reciprocating regulation internationally."

In contrast to pioneering work on the subject, I find robust evidence that flexible exchange rate arrangements do deliver a faster current account adjustment among non-industrial countries.

Evidence suggests that exports respond to expenditure-switching behaviour by consumers when faced with changes in international relative prices.

We also develop a new approach to structurally estimate the Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution (EIS). In the United Kingdom, the mortgage interest rate schedule features discrete jumps — notches — at thresholds for the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, creating strong incentives for bunching below those thresholds. We document large and sharp bunching below every notch, which translates into sizable interest elasticities of mortgage debt, between 0.1 and 1.4 across different LTV levels. We develop a dynamic model that links these reduced-form responses to the underlying structural EIS. The EIS is much smaller and less heterogeneous than the reduced-form elasticities, between 0.05-0.25 across LTV levels and household types. We show that our structural approach is robust to a wide range of assumptions on beliefs about the future, uncertainty, risk aversion, discount factors and present bias. Our findings have implications for the numerous calibration studies in economics that rely on larger values of the EIS."

We argue that these policies can be seen as complements, as QE effectively bypasses the banks by attempting to reduce risk-free yields directly in order to have a wider effect on asset prices, while FLS operates directly through banks by reducing their funding costs and increasing incentives to lend. We attempt to quantify the effects of these policies by estimating their impact on long-term interest rates and bank funding costs, respectively, and then tracing out their wider effects on the macroeconomy using simulations from a large Bayesian vector autoregression (VAR), which are cross-checked with a simpler auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. We find that the second round of the Bank’s QE purchases during 2011–12 and the initial phase of the FLS each boosted GDP in the United Kingdom by around 0.5%–0.8%. Their effect on inflation was also broadly positive reaching around 0.6 percentage points, at its peak."

Based on the impulse responses, we estimate how much banks would be required to increase their deposit rates by to cover a deposit gap caused by funding shocks. Banks generally find it costly to bid-up for deposits to cover a funding gap in the short run. The elasticity of household deposits with respect to the interest rate paid are typically of the order of 0.3, indicating that retail deposits are rate-inelastic. But this varies across banks and the types of shock conditioned on. We also show evidence that banks are more vulnerable to deposit supply shocks than deposit demand shocks.

In our model, credit traps arise when shocks to bank equity capital tighten banks’ borrowing constraints, causing them to allocate credit to easily collateralisable but low productivity projects. Low productivity weakens bank capital generation, reinforcing tight borrowing constraints, sustaining the credit trap steady state. We use the model to study policy options, both ex ante(avoiding credit traps) and ex post (escaping them). Ex ante, restrictions on bank leverage can help to enhance the economy’s resilience to the shocks that can cause credit traps. Further, a policymaker focused on maximising the economy’s resilience to credit traps would set leverage countercyclically, allowing an expansion of leverage in minor downturns and reducing leverage in upswings. However, ex post, relaxing a leverage cap will not help escape the trap. Instead, a range of unconventional policies are needed. We study publicly intermediated lending, discount window lending, and recapitalisation, and compare the efficacy of these policies under different conditions."

A general finding is that COMPASS’s relative forecast performance improves as the forecast horizon is extended (as does that of the Statistical Suite of forecasting models). The performance of forecasts from all three sources deteriorates substantially following the financial crisis. The deterioration is particularly marked for the DSGE model’s GDP forecasts. One possible explanation for that, and a key difference between DSGE models and judgemental forecasts, is that judgemental forecasts are implicitly conditioned on a broader information set, including faster-moving indicators that may be particularly informative when the state of the economy is evolving rapidly, as in periods of financial distress. Consistent with that interpretation, GDP forecasts from a version of the DSGE model augmented to include a survey measure of short-term GDP growth expectations are competitive with the judgemental forecasts at all horizons in the post-crisis period. More generally, a key theme of the paper is that both the type of off-model information and the method used to apply it are key determinants of DSGE model forecast accuracy."

The specification of firms' signal extraction problem under dispersed information removes the need to make use of Blanchard-Kahn conditions to solve the model,thereby removing the need to adhere to the Taylor principle and consequently circumventing the critique of Cochrane (2011). The model admits a determinate, stable solution with no role for sunspot shocks when the monetary authority responds by less than one-for-one to changes in expected inflation,including under an interest rate peg.

In addition,we find that the positive correlation between surviving firms’ employment growth and their relative productivity ranking broke down after 2007/08, as would be expected if an adverse credit supply shock had caused inefficiencies in resource allocation across firms. Indeed, during the immediate recession years 2008/09, this shift was most apparent in sectors with many small and bank dependent businesses. But subsequently, while the contribution of external reallocation to aggregate productivity growth in 2010/13 was smaller than in previous years, this was not obviously associated with sectoral bank dependence.

The estimated model fits a range of US and UK data remarkably well, and produces term premium estimates that are comparable to estimates from the affine term structure model literature. We find that the strong co-movement between US and UK long-term interest rates arises primarily via correlated policy rate expectations, rather than through correlated term premia. This is due to policymakers in both economies responding to foreign productivity and discount factor shocks that cause persistent changes in inflation. We also overcome the common failure of similar models to account for the large influence of foreign disturbances on domestic economies found empirically, where in our model around 40% of the variation in UK GDP can be explained by shocks originating in the US economy."

This quest led institutions to develop Value-at-Risk (VaR) models for their trading portfolios in the 1990s.

These estimates are often superior to the unconditional ones produced by the first generation of VaR models. This paper explores the properties of various filtered historical simulation models. We explain how these models are constructed and illustrate their performance, examining in particular how filtering transforms various properties of return distribution. The procyclicality of filtered historical simulation models is also discussed and compared to that of unfiltered VaR. A key consideration in the design of risk management models is whether the model’s purpose is simply to estimate some percentile of the return distribution, or whether its aims are broader. We discuss this question and relate it to the design of the model testing framework. Finally, we discuss some recent developments in the filtered historical simulation paradigm and draw some conclusions about the use of models in this tradition for the estimation of initial margin requirements."

Following a tightening of capital regulation, branches of multinational banks reduce interbank lending growth by 6 percentage points more relative to subsidiaries of the same banking group.

We also find that they correlate with capital flows more closely than in advanced economies. We then condition the analysis on an exogenous change to a particular component of capital flows: global liquidity, broadly understood as a proxy for the international supply of credit. We identify this shock by aggregating bank-to-bank cross-border credit flows and by using the external instrumental variable approach introduced by Stock and Watson and Mertens and Ravn. We find that in emerging markets a global liquidity shock has a much stronger impact on house prices and consumption than in advanced economies. We finally show that holding house prices constant in response to this shock tends to dampen its effects on consumption in both advanced and emerging economies, but possibly through different channels: in advanced economies by boosting the value of housing collateral and hence supporting domestic borrowing; in emerging markets, by appreciating the exchange rate and hence supporting the international borrowing capacity of the economy."

The intuition is simple; by the time the long-term unemployment rate rises during a recession, the economy may have already transitioned into a relatively flat region of the Phillips curve, generating the misperception that the marginal effect of long-term unemployment on wage inflation is smaller than that of short-term unemployment. Linear models which do not capture state dependence in the slope of the Phillips curve would therefore bias downwards the estimated importance of long-term unemployment in explaining wage dynamics if the true Phillips curve is convex."

We show that this approach is able to match standard specification tests. In addition, term premia display countercyclical behaviour and are positively related to uncertainty about future inflation, consistent with previous findings for the United States. Premia are robust to correction for small sample bias and the inclusion of macro variables as unspanned factors. Including survey information about short rate expectations, which is a common way of improving identification of affine term structure models, however, results in inferior performance using UK data, as measured by standard specification tests and the economic plausibility of the estimated premia. Finally, we show that imposing the zero lower bound within a shadow rate term structure model does not have a large impact on estimates of long-maturity term premia."

Introducing human capital depreciation during unemployment into an otherwise standard New Keynesian model with search frictions in the labour market leads to the finding that the flexible-price allocation is no longer constrained-efficient even when the standard Hosios condition holds. This is because it generates a composition externality in job creation: firms ignore how their hiring decisions affect the extent to which the unemployed workers’ skills erode, and hence the output that can be produced by new matches. Consequently, it might be desirable from a social point of view for monetary policy to deviate from strict inflation targeting. But quantitative analysis shows that although optimal price inflation is no longer zero, strict inflation targeting stays close to the optimal policy."

It can be difficult to tell whether the variations are intentional or whether they occur due to external factors that are beyond the control of the individual banks. We use a recombinant approach to detect instances where observed patterns of liquidity provision are unlikely to have occurred absent of some behavioural or structural factors, such as differences in banks’ business models. Our results suggest that the variations in liquidity provision are larger than would be expected from truly random payment flows."

Increases in US policy uncertainty reduce both bond and equity inflows into EMEs. Conversely, increases in EU policy uncertainty decrease bond inflows, but increase equity inflows. The size and direction of these spillover effects depends on the level of global risk, with increased European policy uncertainty only having a negative impact on bond inflows into EMEs when global risk is high. For equity inflows, the level of country-specific sovereign default risk also matters for non-linearities: increased EU policy uncertainty pushes portfolio equity inflows into EMEs even if global risk is high, but only into countries with low sovereign default risk."

We find no evidence to suggest that QE operated via a traditional bank lending channel (BLC) in the spirit of the model due to Kashyap and Stein. We show in a simple BLC framework that if QE gives rise to deposits that are likely to be short-lived in a given bank (‘flighty’ deposits), then the traditional BLC is diminished. Our analysis suggests that QE operating through a portfolio rebalancing channel gave rise to such flighty deposits and that this is a potential reason that we find no evidence of a BLC.

To assess the incremental impact of QE, we need some counterfactual of how the investment behaviour of institutional investors would have changed in the absence of the policy. We construct this by conditioning on variables that explain portfolio allocation but are invariant to the QE policy itself, which allows us to construct both ex-ante and ex-post counterfactuals. Our analysis of a range of data sources, including national accounts net investment data and micro-data on life insurance companies and pension funds, suggests QE led to institutional investors shifting their portfolios away from gilts towards corporate bonds relative to the counterfactual. Although analysis of the micro-data does suggest some heterogeneity in the response to QE across different institutions, the shift into corporate bonds was quite widespread. However, portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors into riskier assets seems to have been limited to corporate bonds and did not extend to equities."

UK banks were subject to both time-varying capital requirements and changes in interest rate policy. Tightening of either capital requirements or monetary policy reduces the supply of lending. Lending by large banks reacts substantially to capital requirement changes, but not to monetary policy changes. Lending by small banks reacts to both. There is little evidence of interaction between these two policy instruments. The differences in the responses of small and large banks, and the lack of interaction between capital requirement changes and monetary policy, have important policy implications. Our results confirm the theoretical consensus view that monetary policy should focus on price stability objectives and that capital requirement changes are a more effective tool to achieve financial stability objectives related to loan supply. We also identify important distributional consequences within the financial system of these two policy instruments. Finally, our findings do not corroborate theoretical models that raise concerns about complex interactions between monetary policy and macroprudential variation in capital requirements."

It does so using a panel regression approach that accounts for heterogeneity across industries. The key finding is that the rise in China’s import share between 1999 and 2011 is estimated to have lowered UK import price inflation by around 0.5 percentage points per year over the same period – we call this the ‘tailwind from China’. Rising imports from other EME country groups are not found to have any significant impact. Our approach allows us to go further and say that two thirds of the China tailwind arises from the direct impact of importers ‘switching’ to lower cost Chinese goods; the remaining third comes from other exporters lowering their prices in response to strong competition from China. We find no evidence that higher inflation rates in EMEs have so far reduced or reversed the sign of the tailwind yet.

I derive a specific law of motion for the hierarchy of aggregate expectations, which includes a role for network shocks (weighted sums of agents' idiosyncratic shocks). The network causes agents' beliefs to exhibit increased persistence, so that average expectations overshoot the truth following an aggregate shock.

Since firms have to borrow to finance their research and development (R&D) spending, such a rise in the spread leads to a fall in R&D spending, which affects innovation and, hence, reduces TFP growth. In turn, this leads to permanent falls in the levels of output and labour productivity."

I find that, under the regulatory environment existing before the crisis, institutions that ultimately resorted to more intensive efforts (ie debt-equity swaps, mergers with/acquisitions by stronger competitors and outright closure) to deal with financial difficulties had significantly weaker financial profiles as measured by a set of attributes reflecting capital adequacy, asset quality, management skills, earnings performance and liquidity. This study’s framework is useful for characterising financial vulnerability in a regulatory regime similar to that in place before the crisis and, in that respect, is helpful for highlighting weaknesses of the previous regime and for understanding the recent regulatory emphasis on, among other things, a non risk-based capital requirement."

The fall in productivity relative to trend was particularly pronounced within the service sector, and then most particularly in certain subsectors such as ‘Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities’. Given the weight of services in the economy – 75% in GDP and 50% in the CPI – it would seem that understanding how this sector works is crucial if we are to understand how the economy as a whole responds to shocks. But our standard macroeconomic models are not well suited to analysing this sector. In this paper, we try to address these deficiencies by modelling better the service sector and then examine the implications of trying to take certain features of the service sector into account. In order to do this, we first embarked on a series of structured visits to a set of firms that span the service sector. The motivation for doing this was that we could use our findings from these visits to get a better feel for how service sector firms operate and, so, to be able to construct a model of a ‘typical’ service sector firm. We then build a model taking into account what we found from the visits and examined the effects of demand shocks within the model. We find that the model can explain some of the qualitative movements in productivity seen in response to the financial crisis."

We also find that banks tend to favour their most important country relationships, so that the negative cross-border credit supply response in ‘core’ countries is significantly less than in others. Banks tend to cut back cross-border credit to other banks (including foreign affiliates) more than to firms and households, consistent with shorter maturity, wholesale lending which is easier to roll off and may be associated with weaker borrowing relationships."

This paper uses firm-level data from the Office for National Statistics Annual Business Survey and the Inter-Departmental Business Register to better understand the nature of this weakness. Overall, our findings are consistent with existing literature which finds that within-firm productivity growth tends to be procyclical and emphasises the importance of the reallocation of resources between firms and sectors for productivity growth. More specifically, we find that up until 2011 there was a doubling in the proportion of firms with shrinking output and flat employment. This suggests that firms were able to respond flexibly to weak demand conditions by retaining staff at the expense of measured productivity, suggestive of an opening up of spare capacity within firms. However, the strength of recent hiring behaviour since 2012 means that this is now likely to be less of a factor. The lack of labour shedding, together with a low firm exit rate, is also indicative of low levels of resource reallocation between firms and sectors. To assess the importance of this to aggregate productivity growth we apply the method used by Baily, Bartelsman and Haltiwanger. We find that reallocation between firms (in terms of both the movement of labour and firm entry and exit) contributed significantly to aggregate productivity growth before the crisis, but its contribution fell substantially after. In fact, around one third of the productivity slowdown after 2007 can be attributed to slower reallocation of resources. The extent to which reduced factor reallocation, and so the weakness in productivity growth, persists remains a key question for the economic outlook."

This may provide policymakers with a plausible ‘upper bound’ on the short-term effects of future increases in macroprudential capital requirements in certain states of the economic cycle. An increase in the aggregate bank capital requirement during an economic upswing is associated with a reduction of lending, with the effect larger for lending to corporates than for that to households.

We do so by running panel regressions using a rich new data set, exploiting variation in individual bank capital requirements in the United Kingdom from 1990-2011. There are two key results. First, regulatory capital requirements affect the capital ratios held by banks – following an increase in capital requirements, banks gradually rebuild the buffers that they initially held over the regulatory minimum. Second, capital requirements affect lending with heterogeneous responses in different sectors of the economy – in the year following an increase in capital requirements, banks, on average, cut (in descending order based on point estimates) loan growth for commercial real estate, other corporates and household secured lending. The response of unsecured household lending is smaller and insignificant over the first year as a whole. Loan growth mostly recovers within three years. While estimated over a different policy regime and at the individual bank level, these results may contain some insights into how changing capital requirements might affect lending in a macroprudential regime. However, during the transition to higher global regulatory standards, the effects of changes in capital requirements may be different. For example, increasing capital requirements might augment rather than reduce lending for initially undercapitalised banks."

 """,2014.,Identifying channels of credit substitution when bank capital requirements are varied,"485, Bank of England.","What kinds of credit substitution, if any, occur when changes to banks’ minimum capital requirements induce banks to change their supply of credit? The question is central to the new ‘macroprudential’ policy regimes that have been constructed in the wake of the global financial crisis, under which minimum capital ratio requirements for banks will be employed to control the supply of bank credit. Regulatory efforts to influence the aggregate supply of credit may be thwarted to some degree by ‘leakages’, as other credit suppliers substitute for the variation induced in the supply of credit by regulated banks. Credit substitution could occur through foreign banks operating domestic branches that are not subject to capital regulation by the domestic supervisor, or through bond and stock markets. The UK experience for the period 1998-2007 is ideally suited to address these questions, given its unique regulatory history (UK bank regulators imposed bank-specific and time-varying capital requirements on regulated banks), the substantial presence of both domestically regulated and foreign regulated banks, and the United Kingdom’s deep capital markets. We show that leakage by foreign branches can occur either as a result of competition between branches and regulated banks that are parts of separate banking groups, or because a foreign banking group shifts loans from its UK-regulated subsidiary to its affiliated branch. The responsiveness of affiliated branches is nearly twice as strong. We do not find any evidence for leakages through capital markets.

 """,2013.,Has weak lending and activity in the United Kingdom been driven by credit supply shocks?,"482, Bank of England.",This paper investigates the role of credit demand and supply shocks in driving the weakness in UK banks’ lending and economic activity during both the recent financial crisis and the various UK financial crises since 1966. It uses a structural vector autoregression analysis to identify separate credit demand and supply shocks in addition to the standard macroeconomic shocks that are typically analysed in this framework. It finds that credit supply shocks can account for most of the weakness in bank lending since the onset of the crisis and between a third and a half of the fall in GDP relative to its historic trend. It also finds that credit supply shocks appear to behave more like aggregate supply shocks than aggregate demand shocks because they cause output and inflation to move in opposite directions. This may be because credit supply shocks affect potential supply in the economy or because they have a significant exchange rate effect. The results appear robust to different identifying assumptions. The main sensitivity appears to be when spreads are treated as a non-stationary variable and long-run restrictions are placed on the model.

Moreover, demand also shifts towards rentals as they become relatively cheaper. By absorbing excess savings, renting mitigates financial crises."

In addition we employ an empirical framework with time-varying parameters to allow us to see how the impact of oil price shocks may have developed over time. In line with earlier studies on larger economies, we find that the source of the shock does indeed affect the size and nature of the eventual impact on the UK economy. Oil supply shocks typically lead to larger negative impacts on output and slightly higher increases in inflation relative to oil shocks stemming from shocks to world demand, which typically have smaller and largely positive, impacts on UK output. We find evidence that the nature of shocks in the world oil market has changed over time, with the oil price becoming more sensitive to changes in oil production. There is also evidence that the impact of oil shocks became much smaller from the mid-1980s onwards, although the impact has risen slightly since around 2004."

The experiment is a fiscal expansion under the assumption of a pegged nominal rate of interest in linearised sticky price model. We demonstrate that a quantitatively important issue is the articulation of the exit from the policy experiment. If the monetary-fiscal expansion is stochastic with a mean duration of T periods, the fiscal multiplier can be unboundedly large. However, if the monetary-fiscal expansion is for fixed T periods, the multiplier is much smaller. Our explanation rests on a Jensen’s inequality-type argument: the deterministic multiplier is convex in duration, and the stochastic multiplier is a weighted average of the deterministic multipliers. The quantitative difference in the two multipliers also arises in a model with capital, and in the baseline non-linear model. However, the difference between the two is less pronounced in the non-linear models. The errors from a linear approximation are much larger for the stochastic exit model than for the deterministic exit model. Thus, we conclude that the deterministic exit model should be preferred."

A model which allows a financial crisis to have both a short-run effect on the growth rate of labour productivity and a long-run effect on its level is estimated on a panel of 61 countries over 1955-2010. The main finding is that a banking crisis as defined by Reinhart and Rogoff on average reduces the short-run growth rate of labour productivity by between 0.6% and 0.7% per year and the long-run level by between 0.84% and 1.1% (depending on the method of estimation), for each year that the crisis lasts. A banking crisis also reduces the long-run level of capital per worker by an average of about 1%. The corresponding effect on GDP per capita is about double the effect on GDP per worker since there is a long-run, negative effect on the employment ratio."

For that, we use a unique transactions data set for four UK stocks, over the period of a randomly selected week. Our data identifies the counterparties to each transaction, enabling us to track the trading behaviour of individual HFTs. We first find that HFTs differ significantly from each other in terms of liquidity provision: while some HFTs mostly consume liquidity (ie trade more ‘aggressively’) by primarily executing trades via market orders, others mostly supply liquidity (ie trade more ‘passively’) by primarily executing trades via limit orders. To examine how trading behaviour is related to these patterns of liquidity provision, we split the HFTs in two groups, according to their trade aggressiveness, and examine the behaviour and impact of each group separately. We find that the ‘passive’ HFTs follow a trading strategy consistent with market making and as such their trades have alternating signs and are independent of recent (ten-second) price changes. By contrast, ‘aggressive’ HFTs exhibit persistence in the direction of their trades and trade in line with the recent (ten-second) price trend. We then explore the relationship between HFT activity and market quality. We find that both higher price volatility and lower spreads cause HFT activity to increase. We suggest a number of reasons as to why this might be so. Finally, we use a tick time specification to examine the impact of HFT activity on price discovery (ie information-based volatility) and noise (ie excess volatility). We find that while HFTs have a higher information-to-noise contribution ratio than non-HFTs, there are instances where this is accompanied by a large absolute noise contribution."

For example: What role do large banks play in systemic risk? How should capital adequacy standards recognize this role? How is stability shaped by concentration and diversification in the financial system? We explore these questions using a deliberately simplified, dynamical model of a banking system which combines three different channels for direct spillovers from one bank to another: liquidity hoarding, asset price contagion, and the propagation of defaults via counterparty credit risk. Importantly, we also introduce a mechanism for capturing how swings in ‘confidence’ in the system may contribute to instability. Our results highlight that the importance of relatively large, well-connected banks in system stability scales more than proportionately with their size: the impact of their collapse arises not only from their connectivity, but also from their effect on confidence in the system. Imposing tougher capital requirements on larger banks than smaller ones can thus enhance the resilience of the system. Moreover, these effects are more pronounced in more concentrated systems, and continue to apply even when allowing for potential diversification benefits which may be realised by larger banks. We discuss some tentative implications for policy, as well as conceptual analogies in ecosystem stability, and in the control of infectious diseases."

We show that the inability of foreign monetary policy to stabilise the foreign economy at the ZLB creates a spillover that affects how well the home policymaker is able to stabilise its own economy. We show that more stimulatory foreign policy worsens the home policymaker’s trade-off between stabilising inflation and the output gap when home and foreign goods are close substitutes. This reflects the fact that looser foreign policy leads to a relatively more appreciated home real exchange rate, which induces large expenditure switching away from home goods when goods are highly substitutable – just at a time (at the ZLB) when home policy is trying to boost demand for home goods. When goods are not close substitutes the home policymaker’s ability to stabilise the economy benefits from more stimulatory foreign policy."

Using this extended SVAR model we estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the volatility of the shock to US real GDP leads to a decline in UK GDP growth of 0.1% and a 0.1% increase in UK CPI inflation. We then use a non-linear small open economy New Keynesian business cycle model calibrated to US/UK economies to investigate what kind of stochastic volatility shocks can deliver such behaviour. We find that shocks that generate marginal cost uncertainty – such as foreign wage mark-up and productivity stochastic volatility shocks – can reproduce the macroeconomic aggregate responses obtained by the empirical model. An increase in uncertainty, associated with foreign demand shocks on the other hand has a negligible impact on the domestic economy."

In addition, we find that the precise nature of union bargaining has important implications for cyclical unemployment dynamics, with union coverage and density having large and offsetting effects.

CHAPS functioned smoothly throughout the crisis and all CHAPS settlement banks continued to meet their payment obligations. However, the data show that in the two months following the Lehman Brothers failure, banks did, on average, make payments at a slower pace than before the failure. Our analysis suggests this was partly explained by concerns about counterparty default risk as well as system-wide risk. The ratio of payments made to liquidity used was 30% lower in the period from 15 September 2008 to 30 September 2009 than in the period preceding the default of Lehman Brothers. This was due initially to payment delay, but later was due to banks making more payments with their own liquidity, probably because quantitative easing increased the amount of reserves in the system. To assess the economic significance of the observed delays in the value of payments settled, we develop risk indicators, based on Markov models, to quantify the theoretical liquidity impact of delays during an operational outage. We find that payment delays in the months following the failure of Lehman Brothers led to a statistically significant but economically modest increase in these risk measures."

We assume that agents have access to a set of alternative predictors that can be used to form expectations and choose among them based on noisy measures of their recent performance. This dynamic predictor selection generates endogenous fluctuations in the proportions of agents using each predictor, contributing to macroeconomic dynamics. We explore the behaviour of our model when agents have access to two simple predictors. One of the predictors is consistent with a mistaken belief that macroeconomic variables are more persistent than implied by the fundamental shocks hitting the economy. We show that the presence of a ‘persistent predictor’ can lead to changes in beliefs which are self-reinforcing, giving rise to endogenous fluctuations in the time-series properties of the economy. Moreover, we show that such fluctuations arise even if we replace the ‘persistent predictor’ with learning under constant gain."

 """,2012.,Non-rational expectations and the transmission mechanism,"448, Bank of England.","In this paper, we compare two approaches to modelling behaviour under non-rational expectations in a benchmark New Keynesian model. The ‘Euler equation’ approach modifies the equations derived under the assumption of rational expectations by replacing the rational expectations operator with an alternative assumption about expectations formation. The ‘long-horizon’ expectations approach solves the decision rules of households and firms conditional on their expectations for future events that are outside of their control, so that spending and price-setting decisions depend on expectations extending into the distant future. Both approaches can be defended as descriptions of (distinct) forms of boundedly rational behaviour, but have different implications both for the form of the equations that govern the dynamics of the economy and the ease of deriving those equations. In this paper we construct two versions of a benchmark New Keynesian model in which non-rational expectations are modelled using the Euler equation and long-horizon approaches and show that both approaches have very similar implications for macroeconomic dynamics when departures from rational expectations are relatively small. But as expectations depart further from rationality, the two approaches can generate significantly different implications for the behaviour of key variables."

Using transactions data on overnight loans advanced through the UK large-value payments system (CHAPS) in 2003-09, we find a positive and economically significant intraday interest rate. While the implicit intraday interest rate is quite small pre-crisis, it increases more than tenfold during the financial crisis of 2007-09. The key interpretation is that an increase in the implicit intraday interest rate reflects the increased opportunity cost of pledging collateral intraday and can be used as an indicator to gauge the stress of the payment system. We obtain qualitatively similar estimates of the intraday interest rate using quoted intraday bid and offer rates and confirm that our results are not driven by the intraday variation in the bid-ask spread."

Evidence from a UK policy experiment,"445, Bank of England.","The regulation of bank capital to improve the resilience of the financial system and, related to this aim, as a means of smoothing the credit cycle are central elements of forthcoming macroprudential regimes internationally. For such regulation to be effective in controlling the aggregate supply of credit: (i) changes in capital requirements need to affect loan supply by regulated banks, and (ii) substitute sources of credit should not fully offset changes in credit supply by affected banks. This paper examines micro evidence—lacking to date—on both questions, using a unique data set. In the United Kingdom, regulators have imposed time-varying, bank-specific minimum capital requirements since Basel I. Over the 1998-2007 period, UK-regulated banks reduced lending in response to tighter capital requirements. But non UK-regulated banks (resident foreign branches) increased lending in response to tighter capital requirements on a relevant reference group of regulated banks. This ‘leakage’ was material although only partial: it offset—by about one third—the initial impulse from the regulatory change. These results suggest that, on balance, changes in capital requirements can have a substantial impact on aggregate credit supply by UK-resident banks. But they also affirm the importance of cross-country co-operation on macroprudential policies."

 """,2012.,Asset purchase policy at the effective lower bound for interest rates,"444, Bank of England.","This paper studies optimal policy in a stylised New Keynesian model that is extended to incorporate imperfect substitutability between short-term and long-term bonds. This simple modification provides a channel through which asset purchases by the policy maker can affect aggregate demand. Because assets are imperfect substitutes, central bank asset purchases that alter the relative supplies of assets can influence their prices. In the model, aggregate demand depends on the prices (or interest rates) of both long-term and short-term bonds. To the extent that central bank asset purchases reduce long-term interest rates (over and above the effect of expected future short rates), aggregate demand can be stimulated, leading to higher inflation through a standard New Keynesian Phillips Curve. However, the imperfect substitutability between bonds that gives asset purchases their traction also reduces the potency of conventional monetary policy because reductions in the short-term nominal interest rate reduce the relative supply of short-term bonds, increasing the premium on long-term bonds. Nevertheless, a policy in which the policymaker uses asset purchases as an additional policy instrument can improve outcomes in the face of a negative demand shock that drives the short-term policy rate to its lower bound. This is true even if asset purchases policies are also subject to (both upper and lower) bounds."

 """,2012.,Assessing the economy-wide effects of quantitative easing,"443, Bank of England.","This paper examines the macroeconomic impact of the first round of quantitative easing (QE) by the Bank of England which started in March 2009. Although Bank Rate, the UK policy rate, was reduced to ½%, effectively its lower bound, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee felt that additional measures were necessary to meet the inflation target in the medium term. The policy of QE entailed buying private and mainly public assets in large quantities using central bank money, with the aim of injecting money into the economy and boosting nominal spending, in order to help achieve the Bank’s inflation target. Over the period from March 2009 to January 2010, the Bank of England purchased £200 billion of assets, mainly consisting of government securities. We attempt to quantify the effects of these purchases by focusing on the impact of lower long-term interest rates on the wider economy. This is motivated by empirical evidence indicating that QE purchases reduced long-term UK government bond yields by about 100 basis points. Other transmission channels are also possible, but are not considered in this paper. We use three different models to conduct counterfactual simulations to estimate the impact of QE on output and inflation: a large Bayesian VAR; a change-point structural VAR; and a time-varying parameter VAR. Our preferred average estimates from the three models suggest that QE may have had a peak effect on the level of real GDP of around 1½% and a peak effect on annual CPI inflation of about 1¼ percentage points. These estimates are shown to vary considerably across the different model specifications, and with the precise assumptions made to generate the counterfactual simulations, and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty."

We use standard money accounting to try to establish the impact of asset purchases on broad money holdings. We show that the initial impact of £200 billion of asset purchases on the money supply was partially offset by other ‘shocks’ to the money supply. Some of these offsets may have been the indirect result of QE. Our central case estimate is that QE boosted the broad money supply by £122 billion or 8%. We apply our estimates of the impact of QE on the money supply to a set of ‘monetarist’ econometric models that articulate the extent to which asset prices and spending need to adjust to make the demand for money consistent with the increased broad money supply associated with QE. Our preferred, central case estimate is that an 8% increase in money holdings may have pushed down on yields by an average of around 150 basis points in 2010 and increased asset values by approximately 20%. This in turn would have had a peak impact on output of 2% by the start of 2011, with an impact on inflation of 1 percentage point around a year later. These estimates are necessarily uncertain and we show the sensitivity of our results to different assumptions about the size of the shock to the money supply and the nature of the transmission mechanism."

Based on this mapping and the theoretical results about vector autoregressive models of infinite order this paper proposes a minimum distance estimator that: A) matches the k-period responses of the whole vector of the observable variables described by the structural model – caused after a small perturbation to the entire vector of the structural errors – with those observed in the historical data, which have been recovered through the use of a structurally identified vector autoregressive model, and B) minimises the distance between the reduced-form error covariance matrix implied by the structural model and the one estimated in the data. This estimator encompasses those in the literature, is asymptotically consistent, normally distributed and efficient. The J-type overidentifying restrictions statistic that results from this methodology can be used for the evaluation of the structural model. Finally, this study also develops the theory of the bootstrapped version of the estimator and the statistic introduced here. Monte Carlo simulation evidences based on a medium-scale DSGE model reveal very encouraging results for the proposed estimator when it is compared against modern – Bayesian maximum likelihood – and less modern – maximum likelihood and non-efficient IR matching – DSGE estimators."

We find that the puzzling drop in long rates during 2004-05 (Greenspan conundrum) is driven by the demand factor. International reserves, foreign official holdings of longer-term US Treasuries may all be proxies for the preferred-habitat demand factor. For example, foreign purchases in the year to July 2004 appear to have lowered the ten-year rate by about 100 basis points.

Each of the consumption goods is produced according to a sector-specific production function and sticky prices in each sector imply sector-specific New Keynesian Phillips Curves. I show how this model, once estimated, could form a useful additional input within a policymaker’s ‘suite of models’ by considering its implications for the responses of various macroeconomic variables to different economic shocks and by decomposing recent movements of energy and non-energy output and inflation into the proportions caused by each of the shocks."

We find that indices of EM sovereign and corporate credit spreads differ because of their specific reactions to global risk factors. Following the failure of Lehman Brothers, EM sovereign spreads ‘decoupled’ from the US corporate market. In contrast, EM corporate bond spreads widened in response to higher US corporate default risk. We also find that the response of sovereign bond spreads to the VIX was short-lived. However, both EM sovereign and corporate bond spreads widened in flight-to-liquidity episodes, as proxied by the OIS-Treasury spread. Overall, the model is capable of generating other interesting results about the comovement of sovereign and corporate spreads."

We use these estimates to determine the robustness of this payment system to two hypothetical behavioural changes. In the first, a single bank stops sending payments, perhaps because of an operational problem. In the second, it pays out exactly what it previously received, relying exclusively on the liquidity provided by other system members. Using the observed uncertainty around our estimated behavioural equations, we derive probabilistic statements about the time at which the bank’s counterparties would run out of liquidity if they followed their estimated normal-time behaviour."

This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model to analyse the effect on interest rates, asset prices, investment, consumption, output, the exchange rate and the current account of a shift in portfolio preferences of foreign investors. The model has two countries and two asset classes (equities and bonds). It is characterised by imperfect substitutability between assets and allows for endogenous adjustment in interest rates and asset prices. Therefore, it accounts for capital gains arising from equity price movements, in addition to valuation effects caused by changes in the exchange rate. To illustrate the mechanics of the model, we calibrate it to analyse the consequences of an increase in the importance of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). Specifically, we ask what would happen if ‘excess’ reserves held by emerging markets were transferred from central banks to SWFs. We look separately at two diversification paths: one in which SWFs keep the same allocation across bonds and equities as central banks, but move away from dollar assets (path 1); and another in which they choose the same currency composition as central banks, but shift from US bonds to US equities (path 2). In path 1, the dollar depreciates and US net debt falls on impact and increases in the long run. In path 2, the dollar depreciates and US net debt increases in the long run. In both cases, there is a reduction in the ‘exorbitant privilege’, ie, the excess return the United States receives on its assets over what it pays on its liabilities. The model is applicable to other episodes in which foreign investors change the composition of their portfolios."

We find that this model produces the standard responses of macroeconomic variables to productivity shocks, but we also find that financial intermediation shocks, similar to those experienced in the United Kingdom post-2007, have persistent negative effects on economic activity; these effects are reinforced by reductions in trade credit.

We build a three-country DSGE model in which there are two oil-importing countries (home and foreign) and one oil-exporting country. We perform several experiments where we try to disentangle the importance of different factors that can shape inflation dynamics in the home country when the foreign country is hit by a persistent productivity shock. These factors are wage stickiness, the role of the oil sector and its share in both consumption and production, foreign monetary policy and the degree of completeness of financial markets. We find that the tailwinds effect, lowering inflation in the home economy, dominates the headwinds effect as long as there is scope for borrowing and lending across countries and the foreign country’s production is not too oil intensive."

Delegating modified objectives to the monetary policy maker does not change this. We find that the best equilbria under delegation are sometimes inferior to the worse ones without delegation. In general the welfare benefits of schemes like price-level targeting must be regarded as ambiguous."

We estimate a suite of monetary policy models that include both forward and backward-looking representations as well as large and small-scale models. We find an optimal simple Taylor-type rule that accounts for both model and parameter uncertainty. For the most part, backward-looking models are highly fault tolerant with respect to policies optimised for forward-looking representations, while forward-looking models have low fault tolerance with respect to policies optimised for backward-looking representations. In addition, backward-looking models often have lower posterior probabilities than forward-looking models. Bayesian policies therefore have characteristics suitable for inflation and output stabilisation in forward-looking models."

 """,2011.,Mapping systemic risk in the international banking network,"413, Bank of England.","Systemic risk among the network of international banking groups arises when financial stress threatens to criss-cross many national boundaries and expose imperfect international co-ordination. To assess this risk, we apply an information theoretic map equation due to Martin Rosvall and Carl Bergstrom to partition banking groups from 21 countries into modules. The resulting modular structure reflects the flow of financial stress through the network, combining nodes that are most closely related in terms of the transmission of stress. The modular structure of the international banking network has changed dramatically over the past three decades. In the late 1980s four important financial centres formed one large supercluster that was highly contagious in terms of transmission of stress within its ranks, but less contagious on a global scale. Since then the most influential modules have become significantly smaller and more broadly contagious. The analysis contributes to our understanding as to why defaults in US sub-prime mortgages had such large global implications."

By considering the evolution of interbank settlement arrangements and central banking functions in the context of a number of diverse historical country case studies, this paper seeks to improve understanding of the development of, and reasons for, central banks’ current roles. Starting from a situation where the earliest banks gradually began to accept claims on each other, banks introduced a variety of innovations to clear and settle between themselves more efficiently.

Previous work suggests three potential explanations for these events: expansionary monetary policy, capital inflows due to a global savings glut and excessive financial innovation combined with inappropriately lax financial regulation. In this study we examine the effects of these three factors on the housing market. We estimate a panel VAR for a sample of OECD countries and identify monetary policy and capital inflows shocks using sign restrictions. To explore how these effects change with the structure of the mortgage market and the degree of securitisation, we augment the VAR to let the coefficients vary with mortgage market characteristics. Our results suggest that both types of shocks have a significant and positive effect on real house prices, real credit to the private sector and real residential investment. The responses of housing variables to both types of shocks are stronger in countries with more developed mortgage markets, roughly doubling the responses to a monetary policy shock. The amplification effect of mortgage-backed securitisation is particularly strong for capital inflows shocks, increasing the response of real house prices, residential investment and real credit by a factor of two, three and five, respectively."

Two of its central innovations are collective action clauses and seniority clauses. This paper analyses these two clauses when: (1) repayment is endogenous and depends on creditor lobbying effort; (2) litigation for full repayment does not increase the payment to be extracted from the creditor. There is a positive externality of effort that strongly interacts with asset distribution and contractual clauses. Individual litigation is not desirable from the creditors’ point of view since it weakens the incentives to exert effort. Collective action clauses block litigation and maximise repayment, especially when creditors are heterogeneous in the amount of debt they hold. The adoption of seniority clauses modifies the incentives to exert effort and thus repayment. This effect can be positive or negative. If average portfolio sizes are similar but the marginal loan being repaid is unevenly distributed among creditors, repayment falls. Since effort decisions are influenced by asset distribution, the paper also identifies and analyses a novel role for secondary markets."

 """,2010.,"Monetary policy, capital inflows and the housing boom","405, Bank of England.","A range of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the boom in house prices that occurred in the United States from the mid-1990s to 2007. This paper considers the relative importance of two of these hypotheses. First, global imbalances increased liquidity in the US financial system, driving down long-term real interest rates. Second, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low in the first half of the 2000s. Both factors reduced the cost of borrowing and may have encouraged the boom in house prices. This paper develops an empirical framework to separate the relative contributions of these two factors to the US housing market. The results suggest that capital inflows to the United States played a bigger role in generating the increase in house prices than monetary policy loosening. Using VAR methods, we find that compared to monetary policy, the effect of a capital inflows shock on US house prices and residential investment is about twice as large and substantially more persistent. Results from variance decompositions suggest that, at a forecast horizon of 20 quarters, capital flows shocks explain 15% of the variation in real house prices, while monetary policy shocks explain only 5%. In a simple counterfactual exercise, we find that if the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP had remained constant since the end of 1998, real house prices by the end of 2007 would have been 13% lower. Similar exercises with constant policy rates and the path of policy rates implied by the Taylor rule deliver smaller effects."

In particular, we employ an extended version of a factor-augmented VAR, where we introduce time variation in the coefficients and stochastic volatilities in the variances of the shocks. Our formulation has two substantive advantages over earlier work: (i) the additional information summarised by the common factors that are extracted from a large panel of aggregate and disaggregate variables improves the identification of the monetary policy shocks since the factors capture more accurately the amount of information analysed by the monetary authority, (ii) we are able to estimate the time-varying effects of monetary policy surprises on macroeconomic aggregates and disaggregate prices and quantities of personal consumption expenditures. Our main results indicate that time variation is a dominant feature of key macroeconomic variables and their components. In analysing the temporal evolution of disaggregate dynamics, we uncover a considerable amount of heterogeneity in sectoral price responses which suggests that monetary policy actions exert an important, and potentially long-lasting, influence on relative prices in the US economy."

 """,2010.,Liquidity-saving mechanisms and bank behaviour,"400, Bank of England.","This paper investigates the effect of liquidity-saving mechanisms (LSMs) in interbank payment systems. We model a stylised two-stream payment system where banks choose (a) how much liquidity to post and (b) which payments to route into each of two ‘streams’: the RTGS stream, and an LSM stream. Looking at equilibrium choices we find that, when liquidity is expensive, the two-stream system is more efficient than the vanilla RTGS system without an LSM. This is because the LSM achieves better co-ordination of payments, without introducing settlement risk. However, the two-stream system still only achieves a second-best in terms of efficiency: in many cases, a central planner could further decrease system-wide costs by imposing higher liquidity holdings, and without using the LSM at all. Hence, the appeal of the LSM resides in its ability to ease (but not completely solve) strategic inefficiencies stemming from externalities and free-riding. Second, ‘bad’ equilibria too are theoretically possible in the two-stream system. In these equilibria banks post large amounts of liquidity and at the same time overuse the LSM. The existence of such equilibria suggests that some co-ordination device may be needed to reap the full benefits of an LSM. In all cases, these results are valid for this particular model of an RTGS payment system and the particular LSM."

A number of banks, faced with random streams of payment orders, choose whether to link directly to the payment system, or to use a correspondent bank. Settling payments directly on the system imposes liquidity costs which depend on the maximum liquidity overdraft incurred during the day. On the other hand, using a correspondent entails paying a flat fee, charged by the correspondent to recoup liquidity costs and to extract a profit. We specify a protocol whereby one bank in each period can revisit its choice whether to link directly to the system, or to become clients of other banks, thus generating a dynamic client-correspondent network. We simulate this protocol, observing the emergence of different network structures. The liquidity pricing regime chosen by a central bank is found to affect the tiering process and the network structures it produces. A calibration exercise on data from the UK CHAPS system suggests that the model is able to generate realistic predictions, ie a network topology similar to that observed in reality, driven solely by the underlying pattern of payments and the structure of liquidity costs."

The widened reserve target bands may have also had an effect, by partially alleviating the need to manage reserve accounts close to a target and therefore allowing banks to exercise more discretion in forming relationships. However, there is an asymmetry between borrowers and lenders in the overnight market, with borrowers more reliant on the most established of the core banks during the crisis."

This paper reviews the results of a new survey of the price-setting behaviour by the Bank of England of around 700 UK firms. In terms of how companies set prices, the survey evidence supported the use of the mark-up over costs form of pricing. Firms reviewed prices more frequently than actually changing them, with the median firm changing price only once per year, but the frequency with which companies changed their prices varied considerably across sectors. Over the past decade a significant number of firms had increased the frequency of price changes. Different factors influenced price rises and price falls. Higher costs – in particular, labour costs and raw materials – were the most important driver behind price rises, whereas lower demand and competitors’ prices were the main factor resulting in price falls. Nearly half of firms changed their prices within three months of an increase in costs or a fall in demand."

Second, the probability of price changes is not constant over time: prices are most likely to change one, four and twelve months after they were previously set. Third, the distribution of price changes is wide, although a significant number of changes are relatively small and close to zero. Fourth, prices that change more frequently tend to do so by less. And fifth, price changes are much less persistent at the disaggregated level than aggregate inflation data imply.

By February 2010, the MPC had made £200 billion of purchases, most of which had been of UK government securities (gilts). Based on analysis of the reaction of financial market prices and econometric estimates, this paper attempts to assess the impact of the Bank’s QE policy on asset prices. Our estimates of the reaction of gilt prices to the programme suggest that QE may have depressed gilt yields by about 100 basis points. On balance the evidence seems to suggest that the largest part of the impact of QE came through a portfolio rebalancing channel. The wider impact on other asset prices is more difficult to disentangle from other influences: the initial impact was muted but the overall effects were potentially much larger, though subject to considerable uncertainty."

We model time-variation through a Markov-switching structural vector autoregressive framework with variants of the sign restriction identification scheme to back out the time-varying effect of different structural shocks. We investigate the following questions: (i) How has the impact of the mix of real and nominal shocks on the UK economy evolved over time and did this have a specific impact on UK inflation expectations? and (ii) Has there been an autonomous impact of inflation expectations on the UK economy and has it changed over time? Our results suggest that shocks to inflation expectations had important effects on actual inflation in the 1970s, but this impact had significantly declined towards the end of our sample. This seems to be mainly due to a relatively slower response of monetary policy to these shocks in the 1970s compared to later years. Similarly, oil price shocks and real demand shocks led to important changes in macroeconomic variables in the 1970s. Beyond that period and up to the end of our sample oil price shocks became less significant for the dynamics of actual inflation and output growth. However real demand shocks became a relatively more important determinant for fluctuations in those series during the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s. The changing response of monetary policy to this type of shock appears to be crucial for this result."

Focusing on the behaviour of bank loans, we extract the dynamic response of a bank to innovations in its capital and in its regulatory capital buffer. We find that innovations in a bank’s capital in this (pre-crisis) sample period were coupled with a loan response that lasted up to three years. Banks also responded to scarce regulatory capital by raising their deposit rate to attract funds. The international presence of UK banks allows us to identify a specific driver of capital shocks in our data, independent of bank lending to UK residents. Specifically, we use write-offs on loans to non-residents to instrument bank capital’s impact on UK resident lending. A fall in capital brought about a significant drop in lending in particular, to private non-financial corporations. In contrast, household lending increased when capital fell, which may indicate that – in this pre-crisis period – banks substituted into less risky assets when capital was short."

The feedback is caused by credit market imperfections, which dynamically affect how efficiently labour and capital are being used in aggregate.

First, the monetary transmission mechanism works not only via nominal rigidities but also via a reallocation of productive resources away from the most productive agents. Second, following an adverse productivity shock there is a dynamic trade-off between the immediate fall in output, which is an efficient response to the productivity fall, and the fall in output thereafter, which is caused by a reallocation of resources away from the most productive agents. The more the initial output fall is dampened with a temporary rise in inflation, the more the adverse future effects of the reallocation of resources are mitigated. Third, in a full welfare-based analysis of optimal monetary policy I show that it is optimal to have some inflation variability, even if the only shocks in the economy are productivity shocks. The optimal variability of inflation is small, but the costs of stabilising inflation too aggressively can be large."

The transmission of demand, supply and nominal shocks to the real exchange rate, output and inflation has changed substantially over time. Demand shocks have a larger impact on the real exchange rate after the mid-1980s for the United Kingdom, euro area and Japan and after the mid-1990s for Canada.

We find that the category-specific factors account for a large part of the comovement in the prices of goods which are intensive in internationally traded primary commodities; but this is less evident for other traded goods. We also find that both the world factor and the category-specific factors become more significant in explaining the movement in the relative prices in the second half of our sample."

In recent years it has become possible to estimate such models using Bayesian methods. These exercises typically involve augmenting a stochastically singular model with a number of shocks to structural equations to make estimation feasible, even though the motivation for the choice of these shocks is often unspecified. In an attempt to put this approach on a more formal basis, we estimate the model in two stages. First, we evaluate a calibrated version of the stochastically singular model. Then, we augment the model with structural shocks motivated by the results of the evaluation stage and estimate the resulting model using UK data using a Bayesian approach. Finally, we reassess the adequacy of this augmented and estimated model in reconciling the dynamics of the model with the data. Our findings suggest that the shock processes play a crucial role in helping to match the data."

In this paper we use a calibrated overlapping generations model of the household sector to examine the extent to which changes in demographics, lower inflation, and a lower long-run real interest rate may explain the build-up of debt and the rise in house prices over that period. Our model suggests that lower real interest rates were particularly important. If households expected lower real interest rates to persist, then the model can more than explain the rise in debt and can explain most of the rise in house prices. However, the model leaves a puzzle because it predicts that an unanticipated fall in real interest rates should lead to a consumption boom that did not materialise in the data."

A number of stylised facts about pricing behaviour are uncovered. First, prices change very frequently in supermarkets, with 40% of prices changing each week, and even controlling for ‘temporary’ changes, a quarter of prices change each week. Importantly, there is evidence that focusing on monthly observations, rather than weekly ones, overstates the implied stickiness of prices. Second, the probability of price changes is not constant over time – all product categories have declining hazard functions. Third, the range of price changes is very wide, with some very large price cuts and price rises; but despite this, a significant number of price changes are very small. Fourth, there appears to be little link between the frequency and magnitude of price changes – prices that change less frequently do not tend to change by more. Fifth, the strongest correlation between price and volume changes is contemporaneous, suggesting that prices and volumes move together from week to week. And sixth, rough analysis based on simplifying assumptions suggests that consumers are fairly price sensitive: volumes change by more than prices."

In this paper, we consider the effect of fire sales and entry during crises on banks’ ex-ante choice of liquid asset holdings. We consider a setting with limited pledgeability of risky cash flows relative to safe ones and a differential expertise between banks and outsiders in employing banking assets. When a large number of banks fail, market for assets clears only at fire-sale prices and outsiders enter the market if prices fall sufficiently low. In such states, there is a private benefit of liquid holdings to banks from purchasing assets. There is also a social benefit since greater banking system liquidity reduces inefficiency from liquidation of assets to outsiders. When pledgeability of risky cash flows is high, for instance, in countries with well-developed capital markets, banks hold less liquidity than is socially optimal due to risk-shifting incentives; otherwise, banks may hold even more liquidity than is socially optimal to capitalise on fire sales. However, if there is a systemic cost associated with crises, for example, in the form of fiscal costs associated with provision of deposit insurance, then socially optimal liquidity may always be higher than the privately optimal one, and, in turn, regulation in the form of prudent liquidity requirements may be desirable. We provide some international evidence on banks’ liquid holdings that is consistent with model’s predictions."

The nature of risks to financial stability emerging from global liquidity management depends on how these foreign exchange transactions settle. I analyse these risks in a game of asymmetric information. The main result is that the transition from local to global liquidity management, and better co-ordination in settlement of foreign exchange transactions, have two effects. On the one hand, the likelihood rises that payments are delayed beyond their due date. On the other hand, solvency shocks are less likely to be passed on to other banks. The main assumption is that lending between subsidiaries of the same banking group takes place under symmetric information, while external interbank market loans are extended under asymmetric information. More co-ordinated settlement increases the exposure of the intragroup lender relative to the interbank lender and leads to more informed lending."

We exploit the changing volatility of the data to fully identify a structural VAR, without imposing ad hoc restrictions. We find that shocks that widen emerging market sovereign debt (EMBIG) spreads have a negative effect on US interest rates in the short run (consistent with 'flight to quality' effects), while shocks that increase US interest rates raise EMBIG spreads over longer horizons (consistent with 'financing cost' or 'search for yield' effects). We also find that shocks that increase EMBIG spreads tend to widen US high-yield spreads and vice versa, constituting an important contagion channel through which crises in emerging market economies can affect mature markets. Forecast error variance decompositions show that shocks to US long rates can explain around 60%-70% of the variation of EMBIG and US high-yield spreads."

Two channels are investigated. Innovations in wholesale payments technology enhance the security and speed of inside money as a payment medium for customers and therefore affect the split between holdings of cash (outside money) and holdings of deposits (inside money). Second, innovations in wholesale payments technology help establish well-functioning interbank markets for end-of-day funds. This reduces the need for banks to hold excess reserves and thus helps credit creation. We examine these links empirically using payment systems reforms in Eastern European countries as our laboratory. We find evidence that reforms led to a 'crowding in' of cash in favour of demand deposits and that this in turn enabled a prolonged credit expansion in our sample countries. By contrast, while payment system innovations also led to a reduction in excess reserves in some countries, we do not find this effect was causal for the credit boom observed in these countries."

In particular, we are interested in payments behaviour towards a bank that is, for operational reasons, unable to make but able to receive payments. If other banks did not sufficiently monitor their outgoing payments, operational shocks could impact the entire payment system because the affected bank may absorb liquidity from the system. We first build a game-theoretic model in which a bank's decision to make payments depends both on whether another bank experiences operational problems, and on the time of day at which the outage occurs. We then investigate these reactions empirically using a non-parametric method. Our theory predicts that banks stop paying to a bank which has been unable to make payments early in the day, when they are uncertain about the payment instructions they might have to execute. When this uncertainty has been resolved (later in the day), healthy banks make payments even to a bank experiencing the operational problem. Both predictions are supported by the data. We show that this behaviour effectively contains the disruption caused by the operational outage: payment flows between healthy banks are largely unaffected."

First, size and, particularly, the composition of a country's external balance sheet are found to play an important role in the onset of crises. Second, EMEs seem to be more sensitive to external balance sheet variables than developed countries, and so too do economies with fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes. Third, further support is provided to standard theoretical explanations of currency crises. The likelihood of a crisis is found to increase with: the extent to which the real exchange rate rises above its trend; faster growth in broad money (relative to the level of international reserves); larger current account and budget balance deficits; lower GDP growth; and, if a neighbouring country already has a crisis. Economic fundamentals are also found to be a more important explanation of the onset of currency crises during the 1980s than during the 1990s, suggesting that more recent crises are less 'fundamentally' driven."

Our estimates indicate a large decline in the volatility of both yield curve and macroeconomic variables around 1992, when the United Kingdom first adopted an inflation-targeting regime. During the inflation-targeting regime, monetary policy shocks have been more muted and inflation expectations have been lower than in the pre-1992 era. The link between the macroeconomy and the yield curve has also changed over time, with fluctuations in the level factor becoming less important for inflation after the Bank of England independence in 1997.

We find that debt crisis episodes last for long - on average by about ten years - and are associated with large output losses (of at least 5% per year). Sovereign crises rarely occur in isolation - more often than not they are associated with currency crises or banking crises or both. It is the occurrence of a potent cocktail of 'twin' or 'triple' crises that is strongly associated with output losses rather than sovereign crisis per se."

Existing asset pricing theories ascribe moves in risk premia to changes in volatility or risk aversion. Nevertheless, in a simple general equilibrium model, risk premia can be procyclical even though the volatility of consumption is constant and despite a countercyclically varying risk aversion coefficient. We show that agents' expectations about future prospects also influence premium dynamics. In order to generate countercyclically varying premia, as found in the data, one requires a combination of hump-shaped consumption dynamics or highly persistent shocks and habits. Our results, thus, suggest that factors which help match activity data may also help along the asset pricing dimension."

The model imposes no-arbitrage restrictions across nominal and real yields, enabling us to decompose nominal forward rates into expected real short rates, expected inflation, real term premia and inflation risk premia. We find that inflation risk premia and longer-term inflation expectations fell significantly when the Bank of England was made operationally independent in 1997. The 'conundrum' of unusually low long-term real rates that began in 2004 is mainly attributed by the model to a fall in real term premia, though a significant part of the fall is left unexplained. The relative inability of the model to fit long real forwards during much of this recent period may reflect strong pension fund demand for index-linked bonds. Moreover, the model decompositions suggest that these special factors affecting the index-linked market may also partly account for the contemporaneous rise in longer-horizon inflation breakeven rates."

Overall, our results suggest that import prices do help explain movements in inflation; in particular, NKPC models that allow for import prices to enter into firms' costs outperform closed-economy models in sample. However, our results suggest that the influence of import prices has generally remained constant across our sample period, with perhaps only the United Kingdom providing some evidence that import prices have become more important in firms' marginal costs."

But it was arguably the decline in international long real rates over this period which was more unusual and, by the end of 2007, long real rates in the United Kingdom remained at recent historical lows. In this paper, we try to shed light on the recent behaviour of long real rates, by estimating several empirical models of the term structure of real interest rates, derived from UK index-linked bonds. We adopt a standard 'finance' approach to modelling the real term structure, using an essentially affine framework. While being empirically tractable, these models impose the important theoretical restriction of no arbitrage, which enables us to decompose forward real rates into expectations of future short (ie risk-free) real rates and forward real term premia. One general finding that emerges across all the models estimated is that time-varying term premia appear to be extremely important in explaining movements in long real forward rates. Although there is some evidence that long-horizon expected short real rates declined over the conundrum period, our results suggest lower term premia played the dominant role in accounting for the fall in long real rates. This evidence could be consistent with the so-called 'search for yield' and excess liquidity explanations for the conundrum, but it might also partly reflect strong demand for index-linked bonds by institutional investors and foreign central banks."

This is in contrast to a standard ATSM, in which agents are concerned with non-structural risks. As a simple application of a NA-SVAR model, we study the effects of supply, demand and monetary policy shocks on the UK yield curve. We show that all shocks affect the slope of the yield curve, with demand and supply shocks accounting for a large part of the time variation in bond yields.

We then looked at CHAPS and found that payment flows in CHAPS form a well-connected network whose properties change little day to day. This means that liquidity is able to flow efficiently around the network and that the network is quite resilient to shocks.

Importantly, how much of this potential spillover from policy abroad crystallises is still endogenous to the conduct of domestic policy. We also show that an improvement in policy abroad may not reduce domestic volatility when domestic policy is the only poor policy globally. In such a case domestic volatility can even become worse. Our paper also yields interesting results related to the impact of a policy improvement abroad on inflation persistence in the domestic economy and her exposure to foreign shocks."

The parameter is estimated using 'time averages' (with data differenced over long periods) and pooled mean group panel methods. The robust result is that the elasticity is in the region of 0.4. This is consistent with previous results obtained using aggregate UK data, and is also in line with some recent results using US firm-level data. Estimated returns to scale exceed unity. When constant returns are imposed, the estimated elasticity of substitution is not substantially changed."

 """,2008.,Non-linear adjustment of import prices in the European Union,"347, Bank of England.","This paper focuses on the non-linear adjustment of import prices in national currency to shocks in exchange rates and foreign prices measured in the exporters' currency of products originating outside the euro area and imported into European Union countries (EU-15). The paper looks at three different types of non-linearities: (a) non-proportional adjustment (the size of the adjustment grows more than proportionally with the size of the misalignments), (b) asymmetric adjustment to cost-increasing and cost-decreasing shocks, and (c) the existence of thresholds in the size of misalignments below which no adjustment takes place. There is evidence of more than proportional adjustment towards long-run equilibrium in manufacturing industries. In these industries, the adjustment is faster the further away current import prices are from their implied long-run equilibrium. In contrast, a proportional linear adjustment cannot be rejected for some other imports (especially within agricultural and commodity imports). There is also strong evidence of asymmetry in the adjustment to long-run equilibrium. Deviations from long-run equilibrium due to exchange rate appreciations of the home currency result in a faster adjustment than those caused by a home currency depreciation. Finally, we also find that adjustment takes place in the industries in our sample only when deviations are above certain thresholds, and that these thresholds tend to be somewhat smaller for manufacturing industries than for commodities."

 """,2008.,Network models and financial stability,"346, Bank of England.","Systemic risk is a key concern for central banks charged with safeguarding overall financial stability. In this paper we investigate how systemic risk is affected by the structure of the financial system. We construct banking systems that are composed of a number of banks that are connected by interbank linkages. We then vary the key parameters that define the structure of the financial system - including its level of capitalisation, the degree to which banks are connected, the size of interbank exposures and the degree of concentration of the system - and analyse the influence of these parameters on the likelihood of contagious (knock-on) defaults. First, we find that the better capitalised banks are, the more resilient is the banking system against contagious defaults and this effect is non-linear. Second, the effect of the degree of connectivity is non-monotonic, that is, initially a small increase in connectivity increases the contagion effect; but after a certain threshold value, connectivity improves the ability of a banking system to absorb shocks. Third, the size of interbank liabilities tends to increase the risk of knock-on default, even if banks hold capital against such exposures. Fourth, more concentrated banking systems are shown to be prone to larger systemic risk, all else equal. In an extension to the main analysis we study how liquidity effects interact with banking structure to produce a greater chance of systemic breakdown. We finally consider how the risk of contagion might depend on the degree of asymmetry (tiering) inherent in the structure of the banking system. A number of our results have important implications for public policy, which this paper also draws out."

 """,2008.,Efficient frameworks for sovereign borrowing,"343, Bank of England.","This paper presents a theoretical model of strategic default to assess how national and international policymakers should seek to influence the cost of default and the distribution of bargaining power in the event of a default. We find that, in the absence of restrictions on the parameter space, deadweight costs of default should be driven to zero. Moreover, if the debtor is risk-averse, there is an optimal division of bargaining power between the debtor and its creditors. Even with restrictions on the parameter space, marginally lower deadweight costs, possibly in some combination with greater creditor bargaining power, can always raise social welfare ex ante. However, once debt has been contracted, the debtor's trade-off between creditor bargaining power and deadweight costs changes fundamentally. In equilibrium, the deadweight costs of default may therefore tend to be too high, and the allocation of bargaining power inefficiently skewed towards the debtor. The challenge for policymakers is to find credible, time-consistent combinations of policies that can both reduce deadweight costs and shift bargaining power towards creditors."

But estimates based on neoclassical capital demand equations frequently find a smaller value. Recent time-series work for the United States and Canada has suggested that, once the biases inherent in estimating cointegrating vectors are properly accounted for, the elasticity could indeed be close to 1. This paper investigates this possibility for the United Kingdom. First the analysis considers aggregate data where the estimated elasticity is close to 0.4. Then a unique industry-level data set for the United Kingdom is exploited in order to further pinpoint the estimated elasticity. Estimates using dynamic panel data methods are close to those from aggregate data, providing a robust statistical rejection of a unit elasticity in UK data."

In this paper we derive a consistent and general framework to measure the integrated impact of both risks on banks' portfolios. The framework accounts for all sources of credit risk and interest rate risk. By modelling the whole portfolio of a bank and by taking account of the repricing characteristics of all exposures, we can assess the impact of credit and interest rate risk not only on the bank's economic value but also on its future earnings and capital adequacy. We apply our framework to a hypothetical bank in normal and stressed conditions. The simulation highlights that it is fundamental to measure the impact of interest rate and credit risk jointly. We also show that it is crucial to model the whole portfolio, including the repricing and maturity characteristics of assets, liabilities and off balance sheet items."

A vast empirical literature has estimated this structural relationship over various post-war full samples. While it is well known that in a standard sticky price model a 'weak' central bank response to inflation generates sunspot fluctuations, the consequences of pooling observations from different monetary policy regimes for (i) the estimates of the structural Phillips curve and (ii) the estimates of inflation persistence had not been investigated. Using Monte Carlo simulations from a purely forward-looking model, this paper shows that indeterminacy can introduce a sizable persistence in the process of inflation. On the reduced form, our results show that inflation persistence can be endogenous to the policy regime rather than intrinsic to the structure of the economy. On the structural form, we find that by neglecting equilibrium indeterminacy the estimates of the forward-looking term of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve are biased downward. The implications are in line with the empirical evidence for the United Kingdom and United States."

 """,2008.,Risks and efficiency gains of a tiered structure in large-value payments: a simulation approach,"337, Bank of England.","The large-value payment system in the United Kingdom (CHAPS) is highly tiered: a few settlement banks make payments on behalf of many customer banks. This paper makes use of a simulation approach to quantify by how much tiering affects, on the one hand, concentration and credit risk and, on the other, the liquidity needs of CHAPS. We do so by creating scenarios where current settlement banks become customer banks and thus we increase the degree of tiering. The results show that concentration risk would rise substantially in what is already a highly concentrated system. As for credit risk, the size of intraday exposures compared with settlement banks' capital is very small and therefore the likelihood of contagion remote. More importantly, the increase in credit risk brought to the system by settlement banks leaving CHAPS bears little relationship to the values settled by each individual bank. We find that increasing the degree of tiering in CHAPS leads to substantial liquidity savings - although the liquidity saved is only a fraction of the spare liquidity currently posted in the system. Most of the savings are due to liquidity pooling rather than to internalisation of payments. There is a strong relationship between changes in values settled and liquidity needs. This relationship can be used to forecast the impact on liquidity needs if more banks were to join CHAPS. The quantification of the trade-off between risk and efficiency in different scenarios provides policymakers with a useful analytical framework for analysing the effects of tiering."

Use of these uncertain data to form an assessment of current activity can be viewed as a problem of signal extraction. One symptom of that uncertainty is the propensity of statistical agencies to revise their estimates in the light of new information or methodological advances. This paper sets out an approach to extracting the signal from uncertain data that takes the experience of past revisions as representative of the uncertainties surrounding the latest published estimates. Specifically, it describes a two-step estimation procedure in which the history of past revisions (real-time data) are first used to estimate the parameters of a measurement equation describing the official published estimates; and these parameters are then imposed in a maximum likelihood estimation of a state space representation of the 'true' profile of the macroeconomic variable."

It uses a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model characterised by search and matching frictions in the labour market and nominal rigidities in the goods market. It finds that firing costs and unemployment benefits can have substantial effects on aggregate fluctuations. Increasing firing costs decreases the volatility of output, employment and job flows, due to the reduction of the mass of jobs sensitive to disturbances and lower incentives for firms to hire and fire workers. Hence, firms adjust to shocks mainly through prices, and inflation then becomes more volatile. Raising unemployment benefits has the reverse effect on aggregate fluctuations."

We consider a general adjustment cost structure which nests both investment adjustment costs and the traditional capital adjustment costs as special cases. The estimated weight on the former is close to zero for all the industries. When only the investment adjustment cost structure is considered, the estimates of the adjustment cost parameter are small relative to those based on aggregate data, and imply an elasticity of investment with respect to the shadow price of capital (the value to the firm of one additional unit of capital) fifteen times larger than that found in aggregate studies. Our results suggest that from a disaggregated empirical perspective it remains difficult to motivate and interpret the investment friction considered in recent macroeconomic models."

The data set spans the 1975-2000 period, with wage observations covering approximately 1% of the British workforce. Using this data set, we consider whether wages have become more flexible in recent years. Evidence drawn from macroeconomic wage equation estimates suggests that, while the relationship between wages and unemployment seems to have changed, the responsiveness of wages to unemployment rates has declined in the 1990s. In contrast to previous findings, these results suggest that wages have become less flexible. Micro tests mainly reveal that the prevalence of nominal rigidities has not declined, although there is weak evidence for a decline in the most recent years. Micro tests of wage rigidities also include an analysis of real wage rigidities. There is evidence in the NES of spikes in the wage-change distribution at the rate of inflation, beyond what would be anticipated from the rest of the distribution, suggesting the presence of real wage rigidities. This evidence is shown to be statistically significant, and points to an increase in real rigidities over the period of study."

This paper suggests that the United Kingdom, United States and other countries may have escaped from a volatile inflation equilibrium. Our argument builds on the story proposed by Tom Sargent in The conquest of American inflation, where the fall in inflation in the 1980s was attributed to the changing beliefs informing monetary policy. To explain the escape in inflation volatility, we unwind one of Sargent’s simplifications and allow the monetary authority to react to some of the shocks in the economy. In this new model, a revised account of recent history is that when the evidence turned against the existence of a long-run inflation-output trade-off in the 1980s there was an escape from high inflation, but the authorities were also persuaded to stop using changes in inflation to offset shocks. Inflation and inflation volatility therefore escaped in tandem. Our analysis also sheds some light on why the escape in inflation occurred at the time it did. Our model, like the Sargent model it derives from, omits the revolution in institutional design and understanding that underpins monetary policy. So the gloomy predictions for the future derived from a literal reading of it are likely to be unfounded."

This results in ‘cash-in-the-market’ pricing for liquidation of banking assets. At a sufficiently large number of bank failures, and in turn, at a sufficiently low level of asset prices, there are too many banks to liquidate and inefficient users of assets who are liquidity-endowed may end up owning the liquidated assets. In order to avoid this allocation inefficiency, it may be ex-post optimal for the regulator to bail out some failed banks. We show however that there exists a policy that involves liquidity assistance to surviving banks in the purchase of failed banks and that is equivalent to the bailout policy from an ex-post standpoint. Crucially, the liquidity provision policy gives banks incentives to differentiate, rather than to herd, makes aggregate banking crises less likely, and, thereby dominates the bailout policy from an ex-ante standpoint."

 """,2007.,A model of market surprises,"327, Bank of England.","This paper presents a theory to link improvements in transparency about monetary policy objectives to improvements in transparency about monetary policy actions and then to the conditional volatility of market expectations of policy rates. Crucially, policy announcements act not just as an instrument but also as a beacon that can potentially communicate information to agents about the policymakers’ reactions to shocks. When the objectives of policymakers are not made transparent, agents are more likely to interpret any accommodation to price shocks as indicating that policymakers are following their own unobserved suboptimal objectives. Policymakers in these regimes are therefore less inclined to be transparent in their explanations. Conversely when policy objectives are more clearly defined, policymakers become more transparent in their explanations too. Then, the less markets will be surprised by interest rate announcements. I show that happens at a diminishing rate: as transparency is improved further from already high levels, there is less of a reduction in the variance of market surprises. The reason is that agents know that they can rely more on the monetary policy beacon in very transparent regimes. Hence they become more active in their decision-making and policymakers take that extra sensitivity into account. The model illustrates the gains to having clearly defined policy objectives. It also explains how a continued occurrence of market surprises, after an initial large reduction, could be consistent with the greater transparency and more precisely formed inflation expectations."

We catalogue the factors that are most important for determining the size of risk premia and the slope and level of the yield curve. In a world of technology shocks only, increasing the degree of real rigidities raises risk premia and increasing nominal rigidities reduces risk premia. In a world of monetary policy shocks only, both real and nominal rigidities raise risk premia. The results indicate that the implications of the New Keynesian model for average asset returns depend critically on the characterisation of shocks hitting the model economy."

The first factor is an unobserved inflation target, the second factor is annual inflation, and the third factor is a ‘Taylor rule residual’, which, among other things, captures the effects of the output gap and monetary policy surprises in the Taylor rule. We find that the long end of the yield curve is primarily driven by changes in the unobserved inflation target. At shorter maturities, yield curve movements reflect short-run inflation and the Taylor rule residual. For holding periods of one month, our preferred model implies that agents require compensation for risks associated with cyclical and inflation shocks but do not require compensation for shocks to the inflation target. For holding periods beyond one month, agents require compensation for all three sources of risks. Time series of risk premia on long forward rates from the preferred yield curve model have declined since the 1970s, which is consistent with perceptions of declining macroeconomic uncertainty or perhaps more efficient macroeconomic stabilisation policies. Model-implied risk premia at short maturities match up reasonably well with survey-based risk premia, which indicates that the model could be useful for the purpose of extracting market-based interest rate expectations."

We find that if Asia decides to peg her exchange rate to the dollar, the impact of US shocks on European output and inflation is likely to be bigger than it otherwise would have been. This happens because, without nominal exchange rate flexibility, Asian firms react to the shocks originating in the United States by implementing significant price adjustments, which in turn affect Europe’s relative competitive position. On the theoretical side, our results contribute to the literature by suggesting that the shock insulation property of floating exchange rates extends beyond the two countries that have currencies that are free to move. The transmission of shocks between two countries can also be dampened by the choice of floating exchange rates in a third country. On the practical side, we can extend our results to China, the largest Asian economy. If China did eventually decide to float her currency, Europe’s exposure to US shocks would decrease. But, our results also suggest that the overall fall in volatility of Europe’s inflation and output, following China’s floating, might be modest in size."

The comparison serves to benchmark our findings about the determinants of UK corporate debt. In addition, the UK financial sector is significantly exposed to the corporate sectors in the United States, Germany and France. The model assesses the contribution of investment, acquisitions, cash flows and market-to-book values to the determination of debt, and also the tendency of debt to revert to its optimum level. Debt was found to be positively related to the financing needs of the firm, and the optimum level of debt to be negatively related to the market-to-book ratio. This casts some light on the procyclicality of debt. It suggests the growth of debt in a boom is explained by the increase in financing needs; and this more than offsets the fall in the optimum level of debt associated with the rising market-to-book value. In addition, we found that it may be expected that, in a boom, German and US debt will rise above the optimum level by more than in the United Kingdom and France – responding to the higher levels of investment and acquisitions. And in a slowdown, when adjusting back down to the optimum, German and US debt tends to be paid down more slowly."

This threat to financial stability largely explains why central banks seek to ensure – via their ‘oversight’ role – that financial infrastructures take sufficient measures to mitigate risk. This paper explores the role of governance of infrastructures in the management of systemic risk. We do this by considering the case of a generic infrastructure provider operating under different forms of ownership. We show that, in the presence of consumption externalities, the level of risk mitigation chosen by the infrastructure provider is less than socially optimal. We then show that governance may have a role in adapting a provider’s decision-making process to take due account of their risk externalities and, hence, provide a more socially optimal level of risk mitigation. Specifically, we suggest a feasible adaptation could be for infrastructures to appoint external stakeholder representatives to their boards with a specific remit to act in the wider public interest."

 """,2006.,Do announcements of bank acquisitions in emerging markets create value?,"315, Bank of England.","The latter half of the 1990s saw a sharp rise in entry of banks from developed countries into emerging market financial systems. This was motivated by, among other things, the belief that expansion into underdeveloped financial markets would result in diversification and efficiency gains, and thus prove to be value creating. This paper uses a standard event-study methodology to determine the reaction of the acquirer’s stock price to announcements of acquisitions in emerging financial markets (EFMs). Under the assumption of efficient markets, a positive reaction is interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that expansion into EFMs is value creating. However, in line with the literature on cross-border banking acquisitions in developed countries, announcements are found to be associated with negative abnormal returns for the acquirer, suggesting that potential downsides, such as operational risk, legal and social barriers, and political risk, are judged by markets to outweigh the potential benefits. Moreover, the value destruction from an acquisition was found to be bigger in all regions in the 18 months following the Asian crisis."

This paper examines quarterly microdata from the Survey of Mortgage Lenders to learn about changes in credit conditions from loan to value ratios (LVRs) and loan to income ratios (LIRs) of first-time buyers (classified by region and age). It combines data on the proportions of high LVR and high LIR loans with aggregate information on UK consumer credit and mortgage debt to give ten quarterly series for 1975-2001. These are modelled in a ten-equation system. A comprehensive set of economic and demographic influences on the demand and supply of credit, applying relevant sign restrictions, are controlled for. A single time-varying index of credit conditions captures the common variation in the ten credit indicators which cannot be explained by the economic and demographic controls. The broad coverage of credit market indicators and thorough investigation of economic forces driving the credit market should make the resulting credit conditions index more robust than previous estimates. The index increases in the 1980s, peaking towards the end of the decade. It retraces part of this rise in the early 1990s, before increasing again to levels, for one of the two measures, exceeding the previous peak. The index is useful in modelling consumption and the housing market, and in interpreting current monetary conditions. An important by-product of the paper is the model for consumer credit and mortgage debt developed here."

This paper builds a dynamic general equilibrium model to analyse the macroeconomic consequences of changes in the cost of bank capital, and thus the cost of bank credit. The model includes the interaction between the supply side (banking sector) and the demand side (corporate sector) of the credit market. The analysis suggests that bank capital channels may be an important part of the monetary transmission mechanism, particularly when there are large, direct shocks to banks’ balance sheets. Such shocks could occur when there are structural changes that affect the banking system. The impulse responses are likely to be magnified due to the interaction between the supply and the demand sides of the credit market."

Consistent with earlier studies, we find evidence for significant heterogeneity among the estimated industry-specific pass-through rates. In an environment where cross-sectional heterogeneity is significant the use of aggregate data can be misleading since aggregation may lead to heavily biased ERPT estimates at the economy-wide level. We demonstrate that the aggregation bias caused by this heterogeneity is not negligible for the UK data. Further, we investigate the source of the cross-sectional variation in the estimated industry-specific pass-through rates. For our sample, we find the industry-specific average inflation rates to be significant in explaining this variation. Furthermore, we find evidence for short-run and long-run partial pass-through into food and manufacturing sectors. As for the economy-wide ERPT the conclusion stands, possibly reflecting the relatively large weight of manufacturing goods in UK imports. Finally, we find a significant reduction in estimated ERPT rates since 1995 caused by increased stability of the UK economy over the past decade."

The behaviour of the yen real exchange rate has most stubbornly challenged the PPP hypothesis and deepened this puzzle. This paper contributes to this discussion by providing new evidence on the stationarity of bilateral yen real exchange rates. We employ a non-linear version of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, based on an exponentially smooth-transition autoregressive model (ESTAR) that enhances the power of the tests against mean-reverting non-linear alternative hypotheses. Our results suggest that the bilateral yen real exchange rates against the other G7 and Asian currencies were mean reverting during the post-Bretton Woods era. Thus, the real yen behaviour may not be so different after all but simply perceived to be so due to the use of a restrictive alternative hypothesis in previous tests."

Instead, we take an entirely different approach, not using the first-order conditions from the firm’s maximisation problem but instead exploiting the present-value expression for the firm’s value. The standard linearised present-value asset price decomposition suggests that Q should be able to predict other variables, such as stock returns. Using UK data we find that it has strong long-horizon predictive power for debt accumulation, stock returns and UK business investment. The correctly signed results on both returns and investment appear to be robust, and are supported by the commonly used and bootstrapped standard error corrections, as well as recently developed asymptotic corrections."

An empirical application on UK and US data confirms that fundamental inflation tracks actual inflation reasonably well in both countries.

 """,2006.,Optimal emerging market fiscal policy when trend output growth is unobserved,"308, Bank of England.","This paper is concerned with how fiscal policy in emerging markets should respond to economic fluctuations. We model the behaviour of a fiscal authority in an emerging market country who can use external borrowing to smooth the effects of exogenous output shocks on domestic agents’ private consumption. We focus on the policy implications of the facts that (1) the GDP process in emerging markets is characterised by a relatively volatile trend growth rate, and (2) that policymakers cannot directly observe the output gap or the trend GDP growth rate. We have two key findings. First, we find that risk-averse policymakers who face EME-style output processes (ie processes dominated by shocks to the trend growth rate) should run tighter fiscal policies, with lower average debt-GDP ratios, than those in industrialised countries, who face different output processes. Second, our baseline parameterisation suggests that EME policymakers should run countercyclical fiscal policies. This result contrasts with other papers which have used optimising frameworks and the features of EME output processes to rationalise the observed procyclicality of EME fiscal policies or external balances. Simulations suggest that the welfare costs of naively running a fiscal policy that would be appropriate for an industrialised country are around 1% of certainty-equivalent consumption, but this result is sensitive to parameterisation. We find that a simple rule-of-thumb policy that stabilises the debt-GDP ratio in every period entails much smaller welfare losses."

 """,2006.,Fiscal rules for debt sustainability in emerging markets: the impact of volatility and default risk,"307, Bank of England.","The determinants of public debt dynamics – real interest rates, the real exchange rate, output growth and the primary fiscal balance – are typically more volatile in emerging market economies than in industrialised countries. Capital markets also typically demand higher interest rates from emerging markets when their debt dynamics deteriorate. This paper considers how these characteristics affect the choice of fiscal policy rules in emerging markets. We estimate an econometric model of the determinants of public debt dynamics on Brazilian data and use this model to simulate the effect of different fiscal policy rules for future paths of debt. We then derive the set of fiscal policy rules which stabilise public debt dynamics. We find that macroeconomic forecast uncertainty and feedback among the endogenous variables (principally from the debt-GDP ratio to interest rates) force the policy rule to be significantly more responsive to changes in public debt. Rules that would stabilise debt in a fully known world may not do so when the policymaker is faced with a realistic pattern of shocks. The method we employ may be a useful addition to the toolkit of domestic and international policymakers when assessing fiscal rules and debt sustainability."

First, what percentage of households display excess sensitivity to income? Second, what affects the likelihood of being in that group? Third, is there a collateral channel from house prices to consumption? We find 20%-40% of households display excess sensitivity. These households may be liquidity constrained or saving for other precautionary reasons. This is found to be more likely for those without liquid assets, with negative home equity, the young, unmarried, non-white and the degree-educated. According to the 'collateral channel', house prices influence consumption by allowing households that would otherwise be liquidity constrained to borrow on more attractive terms. A key implication of that view is that capital gains on housing should influence the consumption of the liquidity constrained/precautionary saving households, but not other households. We test that implication for the first time and find direct evidence in support."

The chief contribution of the paper is to analyse how these financial sector imperfections - in particular, those relating to the banking sector - modify our understanding of optimal monetary policy. Our main finding is that optimal monetary policy tolerates only a very small amount of inflation volatility.

 """,2006.,The danger of inflating expectations of macroeconomic stability: heuristic switching in an overlapping generations monetary model,"303, Bank of England.","The volatility of inflation and output has fallen in most advanced economies in the 1990s and 2000s. We use a monetary overlapping generations model to discuss the cause and durability of this macroeconomic change. In that model, agents' decision rules require them to make forecasts of future inflation, which, because of shocks to productivity, is uncertain. Agents make forecasts of inflation using two rules of thumb or 'heuristics'. One is based on lagged inflation, the other on an inflation target announced by the central bank. They switch between those heuristics based on an imperfect assessment of how each has performed in the past. The way the economy propagates productivity shocks into inflation depends on the proportion of agents using each. Movements in that proportion generate fluctuations in small sample measures of economic volatility. We use this simple model of heuristic switching to contrast the performance of monetary policy rules. We find that, relative to the rule that would be optimal under rational expectations, a rule that responds to both productivity shocks and inflation expectations better stabilises the economy but does not prevent agents switching between heuristics. Finally, we study the impact of introducing an explicit inflation target, which can be used by agents as a simple heuristic, into an economy that did not previously have one. Depending on the heuristics agents have access to before the introduction of the target, this can result in reduced inflation volatility."

 """,2006.,International and intranational consumption risk sharing: the evidence for the United Kingdom and OECD,"302, Bank of England.","'Consumption risk sharing' refers to the ability of agents to insure or protect their consumption against shocks to their income, for example, by borrowing and lending or holding claims on foreign equity. So measuring the extent of risk sharing informs us about how consumption is likely to respond to country or region-specific shocks to income. This paper presents the evidence for consumption risk sharing by UK consumers, both across regions of the United Kingdom (intranationally) and between the United Kingdom and other countries (internationally). The main motivation for collecting this evidence is to establish to what extent UK consumers insure against income risks, and whether they do so to the same extent intranationally and internationally. Such evidence can tell us whether risk sharing functions effectively as an absorber of country or region-specific shocks in the United Kingdom. We find that there is more risk sharing across the UK regions than between the United Kingdom and other OECD countries. To test the robustness of our conclusions, we document the evidence for risk sharing using recent econometric techniques, which allow explicitly for country or region-specific factors impacting on consumption and output, including measurement errors in the data. We find that our results remain robust when we account for the possible impact of measurement error and preference shocks, and are consistent with results reported in the existing literature. Additionally, our paper also makes a separate contribution to the literature by illustrating the role of the choice of deflators in estimating the true extent of risk sharing for the United Kingdom and OECD. In terms of the channels through which risk sharing occurs, we find that the main mechanism of regional risk sharing operates via cross-regional asset holdings. Internationally, the main source of income smoothing comes from international borrowing and lending."

Payment systems, by supporting transactions, are a key aspect of this. In this paper, we examine the importance of smoothly functioning payment systems to the economy by extending a recently developed theoretical model of banks. In the model the risk of theft implies a cost to using cash. This risk can be avoided by depositing cash in banks and transferring money through an interbank payment system. However, agents are then exposed to the risk that the payment system is unreliable. Agents will use a payment system (rather than cash) to make transactions if the system is sufficiently cheap to use and/or it is sufficiently reliable. We show that the introduction of a payment system that buyers and producers choose to use unambiguously increases social welfare if it expands the number of trades occurring in the economy. This is more likely the more reliable is the payment system. When the introduction of a payment system does not increase the number of trades, social welfare may increase or decrease depending on the trade-off between the risk of using cash and the risk that the payment system is unreliable. We again show that the more reliable is the payment system, the more likely welfare is increased by its introduction and we illustrate how this benefit might be quantified."

Using the factor-demand equations for capital and labour, technical progress can also be estimated as a stochastic process, rather than just imposing a time trend. The resulting estimates of the whole-economy markup for the UK economy suggest that it has fallen over the past 30 years, and this result appears to withstand a variety of robustness checks. The estimated elasticity is somewhat lower than most previous estimates. This implies that conventional techniques may be misleading."

This was a period when the growth rate of the standard measure of TFP growth for the United Kingdom, the Solow residual, did not match the sharp rise in US productivity, even though the macroeconomic environment in both countries was similar. The paper delivers two main results. First, the aggregate Solow residual underestimates TFP growth throughout the 1990s, since it does not account for falling utilisation rates and high capital adjustment costs. Second, the impact of non-technological factors on the Solow residual is similar in the first and the second half of the 1990s. This means that the broad movement in the Solow residual during the 1990s is similar to that of the estimated TFP growth.

This paper considers the empirical implications of this borrowing constraint for the housing market. It shows that, at the aggregate level, models of the housing market that incorporate the constraint are consistent with the following stylised facts: i) a positive correlation between house price inflation and transactions; ii) greater volatility of former owner-occupiers' house price inflation than for first-time buyers; iii) the presence of first-time buyers in the market falls with the rate of change of house prices; and iv) house prices are more sensitive to the incomes of the young. The paper then exploits variation across local housing markets in the rate of change in house prices and considers how leverage affects the response of the rate of change of house prices to shocks. The evidence, based on data for 147 district-level housing markets for the period 1993-2002, suggests that a large incidence of households with high levels of leverage (loan to value ratios) raises the sensitivity of house prices to a shock. This is also consistent with the down-payment constraint model of the housing market."

Under asymmetric information, we show that the first-best outcome is achievable when the authorities can close all banks that fail to raise a minimum level of new capital. But when the authorities cannot close banks and must rely on financial incentives to induce banks to liquidate their NPLs, recapitalisation using equity (Tier 1 capital) would be the second-best policy, whereas recapitalisation using subordinated debt (Tier 2 capital) is suboptimal. If the authorities do not wish to hold an equity stake in a bank, they should subsidise the liquidation of non-performing loans rather than inject subordinated debt. We also show that the cost of this subsidy can be reduced if it is offered in a menu that includes equity injection."

We find that, historically, inflation persistence has been the exception, rather than the rule, with inflation estimated to have been highly persistent only during the period between the floating of the pound, in June 1972, and the introduction of inflation targeting, in October 1992. As a corollary, our results clearly reject Mishkin's explanation for time variation in the extent of the Fisher effect, favouring instead Barsky's theory. We document a remarkable stability across regimes in the correlation between inflation and the rates of growth of both narrow and broad monetary aggregates at the very low frequencies, thus countering the Whiteman-McCallum criticism of Lucas. The post-1992 inflation-targeting regime appears to have been characterised, to date, by the most stable macroeconomic environment in recorded UK history, with the volatilities of the business-cycle components of real GDP, national accounts aggregates, and inflation measures having been, post-1992, systematically lower than for any of the pre-1992 monetary regimes/historical periods, often markedly so, as in the case of inflation and real GDP. The Phillips correlation between inflation and unemployment was flattest under the gold standard, steepest between 1972 and 1992. In line with Ball, Mankiw and Romer, evidence points towards a positive correlation between mean inflation and the steepness of the trade-off. We show how Keynes, in his dispute with Dunlop and Tarshis on real wage cyclicality, was entirely right: during the inter-war period, real wages were strikingly countercyclical. By contrast, under inflation targeting they have been, so far, strongly procyclical."

These subsamples correspond to the pre-Volcker period for the United States and the period prior to the introduction of the inflation targeting framework for the United Kingdom. Using a micro-founded New Keynesian monetary policy model for the US economy, we then show that the structural VARs are capable of reproducing the price puzzle from artificial data only when monetary policy is passive and hence multiple equilibria arise. In contrast, this model never generates on impact a positive inflation response to a policy shock. The omission in the VARs of a variable capturing the high persistence of expected inflation under indeterminacy is found to account for the price puzzle observed in actual data."

Previous studies of CCP margining have largely focused on the unconditional distribution of returns, estimating margin coverage on a long-term average basis. The present study extends previous work by estimating conditional margin coverage using a GARCH (1,1) model, so that variations in coverage can be tracked over a much shorter time frame. The model is applied to estimating non-coverage probabilities for two heavily traded derivatives contracts, the Brent and FTSE 100 futures. To account for the well-documented fat-tailed characteristics of distributions of futures returns, several variants of the GARCH model are estimated. These assume that innovations are distributed according to either normal, Student t, extreme value or historical distributions. Backtesting is used to select the best performing distribution. During the sample period, margins are found to provide a coverage level generally in excess of 99%, over a one-day time horizon. It is noted, however, that the coverage probability implied by the model is likely to fall under more volatile market conditions; under these circumstances central counterparties will reset initial margin more frequently and call for margin intraday."

This constitutes a liquidity risk to the system. Furthermore, a bank operating in multiple systems may face a mismatch between the location of its collateral holdings and liquidity needs. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the liquidity risk arising from such a mismatch may be mitigated by allowing cross-border use of collateral. We develop a two-country, two-bank model in which risk-neutral banks minimise expected costs with respect to their collateral choice in each country. In our baseline model, in which each bank faces a liquidity need in only one country, we find that liquidity risk is indeed reduced by cross-border use of collateral. This result holds despite the fact that banks may find it optimal to economise on their total holdings of collateral. However, when we extend the model to allow for the possibility that a bank faces liquidity needs in both countries simultaneously, the total quantum of collateral held is important. Indeed, when a bank finds it optimal to reduce its total holdings, there may be an increase in liquidity risk in at least one country when simultaneous liquidity demands are realised."

 """,2005.,"The New Keynesian Phillips Curve in the United States and the euro area: aggregation bias, stability and robustness","285, Bank of England.","In the recent past, the empirical literature on the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) has grown rapidly. The NKPC has been shown to describe satisfactorily the relationship between inflation and marginal cost both for the United States and the euro area. However, little attention has been given so far to the stability and robustness of the parameters in the estimated NKPC. In this paper, we aim to help fill this gap. After estimating hybrid NKPCs on US and euro-area data using the generalised method of moments and having found that our results are broadly in line with previous findings, we subject our estimated NKPCs to a thorough stability analysis. We find that the estimated coefficients for the United States are stable, whereas those for the euro area are considerably less stable. We then investigate the possible reasons for this instability. One explanation, explored using the Andrews' test, is the presence of structural breaks. Another possibility is the presence of an aggregation bias, which we investigate by estimating NKPCs for the three largest euro-area economies: Germany, France and Italy. At this disaggregated level, the fit of the NKPC improves, but the coefficients are still unstable. Furthermore, the disaggregated analysis indicates the presence of structural breaks in the three largest euro-area economies."

The model emphasises the interaction between input (raw materials and work-in-process) and output (finished goods) inventories. This interaction is an important empirical regularity and proves critical for the ability of the model to fit the data. Decisions about input and output inventory investment cannot be considered in isolation from each other, but must be analysed jointly. Overall, the stage-of-fabrication model receives considerable support. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model's decision rules yields correctly signed and significant parameter estimates. In terms of producer behaviour, the results imply rising marginal costs of production and significant costs of adjusting production."

Like other indicators in the literature, it is based on a comparison of risk-neutral probabilities of future returns with the corresponding subjective probabilities. The precise nature of the comparison is novel, however, and involves comparing probabilities across the full range of potential returns. Unlike other indicators, our measure of market sentiment distinguishes risk appetite from risk aversion, and is reported in levels rather than changes. Implementation of the approach yields results that respond to crises and other major economic events in a plausible manner."

We attempt to account for the dynamics between banks' write-offs and key macroeconomic variables, through conditioning our stress test on the historical correlation between the variables and allowing for feedback effects from credit risk to the macroeconomy. In contrast to most existing empirical stress testing work, this paper uses a direct measure of banks' fragility - the write-off to loan ratio. We find that both UK banks' total and corporate write-offs are significantly related to deviations of output from potential. Following an adverse output shock, total and corporate write-off ratios increase. Mortgage arrears, on the other hand, appear to be mainly dependent on household income gearing. The results suggest that, even if the most extreme economic stress conditions witnessed over the past two decades were repeated, the UK banking sector should remain robust."

This paper discusses how to deal with this, and is in two parts. In the normative part of the paper, we study the design of monetary policy rules in a model that has the feature that data uncertainty varies according to the vintage. We show how coefficients on lagged variables in optimised simple rules for monetary policy increase as the relative measurement error in early vintages of data increases. We also explore scenarios when policymakers are uncertain by how much measurement error in new data exceeds that in old data. An optimal policy can then be one in which it is better to assume that the ratio of measurement error in new compared to old data is larger, rather than smaller. In the positive part of the paper, we show that the response of monetary policy to vintage varying data uncertainty may generate evidence of apparent interest rate smoothing in interest rate reaction functions: but we suggest that it may not generate enough to account for what has been observed in the data."

These measures show that improvement in labour quality, as proxied by education, age and gender, has added on average 0.67 percentage points per year to the growth rate in total labour input. Changes in the education distribution more than account for the improvement in labour quality, adding 0.68 percentage points per annum. Changes in the age distribution have made a much smaller contribution, adding only 0.11 percentage points to the growth rate. The rise in female participation has had a small negative effect of 0.08 percentage points, as women have had a preference for part-time work, which tends to be paid less per hour than full-time jobs. Using this evidence, the key finding of this paper is that a large proportion of growth that is usually attributed to TFP (total factor productivity) growth can be accounted for by an improvement in the quality of labour input. This result has no implications for the measurement of UK GDP growth from 1975-2002, but it does help to identify more accurately the sources of that growth."

In other words, setting policy on the basis that the private sector is subject to misperceptions is a 'robust' policy"

A dynamic probit approach,"277, Bank of England.","Since the mid-1990s the volume of secured lending to households has expanded rapidly, both in absolute terms and in relation to household incomes. This paper examines the determinants of households' ability to service this stock of secured debt. It estimates a random effects probit model for the probability of households having mortgage payment problems. It is found that past experience of payment problems increases the probability that the household has difficulties servicing its secured debt today. At the household level, becoming unemployed, interest income gearing of 20% and above, high loan to value ratios and having a heavy burden of unsecured debt are all associated with a significantly higher probability of mortgage payment problems. Saving regularly and having unsecured debt which is not a problem are both associated with a significantly lower probability of mortgage payment problems. The only non-household-specific variable to have a significant effect is mortgage interest rates - the probability of payment problems increases with the level of mortgage interest rates. An aggregate measure of debt at risk is calculated. This has decreased between 1994 and 2002, as falls in the probability of mortgage payment problems have more than offset increases in the stock of mortgage debt outstanding. It is found that the fall in the probability of mortgage payment problems has been greatest among the most highly indebted households."

The international evidence suggests that the mpcw varies considerably across countries, and new estimates are presented, based on structural vector autoregressions (VARs) for eleven OECD countries, which tend to confirm this finding. It is argued that there is little theoretical rationale for a wide cross-country dispersion of the mpcw, and that the cross-country differences in empirical estimates may in fact reflect difficulties in the measurement of wealth across countries and a failure to account for the shocks causing changes in both consumption and wealth. Using a suitable panel technique, it is found that the hypothesis of a common long-run mpcw across countries cannot be rejected consistently, and a plausible estimate is obtained for the cross-section of eleven OECD countries. This estimate is a little over 6%, broadly consistent with estimates used in a wide range of policy models."

The results give some support to the view that there is substitution between market finance and bank loans - loan growth rises (falls) during periods when corporate bond spreads widen (decline). In particular, bank loans seem to substitute for other forms of finance in some periods of market stress such as in 1998 Q3. Moreover, this increase in credit seems to be supplied on unchanged terms, perhaps suggesting that banks passively accommodate changes in corporate loan demand. During other episodes of disturbances in non-bank finance, such as when bond or commercial paper issuance falls sharply, banks appear to increase their loan rates, perhaps reflecting greater perceived borrower risk or some reduction in banks' own risk appetite."

 """,2005.,"'Real-world' mortgages, consumption volatility and the low inflation environment","273, Bank of England.","This paper considers the interaction between the microeconomic decisions facing households and the macroeconomic environment in a setting where households have `real-world' mortgage contracts. In particular, we consider the possible consequences of the important changes in the framework for setting monetary policy in the United Kingdom in recent decades that have coincided with a more stable and low inflation environment. We set a model of households with 'real-world' mortgages in a partial equilibrium overlapping generations framework calibrated to UK data. We find that the welfare gains of the change of regime would have been considerable. However, the baseline calibration of the model implies that the volatility of aggregate consumption growth would actually be higher in the steady state in the more stable environment of the 1990s regime. This is due to greater synchrony in the response of households to shocks, offsetting the smaller magnitude of macroeconomic shocks. This effect is amplified by higher levels of debt in the 1990s. The result that aggregate consumption volatility could be higher in the current regime suggests that the observed fall in aggregate consumption volatility cannot necessarily be attributed to the more stable macroeconomic environment and the role of mortgage debt. If this result applies, this would suggest that the observed fall in volatility may be due either to other factors or may be a transitional phenomenon rather than a feature of the new steady state."

The results of two identification strategies are compared. One is based on traditional zero restrictions and, as an alternative, an identification scheme based on more recent sign restrictions is proposed. The main conclusion is that the recent slowdown was caused by a combination of several shocks: a negative aggregate supply and aggregate spending shock, the increase of oil prices in 1999, and restrictive monetary policy in 2000. These shocks were more pronounced in the United States than the euro area. The results are somewhat different depending on the identification strategy. It is illustrated that traditional zero restrictions can have an influence on the estimated impact of certain shocks."

 """,2005.,"Consumption, house prices and expectations","271, Bank of England.","Over much of the past 25 years, the cycles of house price and consumption growth have been closely synchronised. Three main hypotheses for this co-movement have been proposed in the literature. First, that an increase in house prices raises households' wealth, particularly for those in a position to trade down the housing ladder, which increases their desired level of expenditure. Second, that house price growth increases the collateral available to homeowners, reducing credit constraints and thereby facilitating higher consumption. And third, that house prices and consumption have tended to be influenced by common factors. This paper finds that the relationship between house prices and consumption is stronger for younger than older households, and that the consumption of homeowners and renters are equally aligned with the house price cycle. This suggests that neither the wealth nor the collateral channels have been the principal cause of the relationship between house prices and consumption - instead, the most important factor is likely to have been common causality."

But if borrowers can be 'publicly monitored' by an outside agency that disseminates the information about their creditworthiness, their choice between bank loans and bond finance is determined endogenously by the trade-off between two deadweight costs: the crisis cost of a sovereign default and the cost of debtor moral hazard. In equilibrium, sovereigns use bank loans for financing short-term projects and bond issuance for projects with uncertain timing of cash flows if crisis costs are large. We also demonstrate that state-contingent debt and IMF intervention can improve welfare."

Probit models for participation are estimated and age, income, positive financial prospects and housing tenure are found to be very significant and have the expected sign according to a life-cycle model for consumption. Regressions to explain the level of borrowing by individuals suggest that income is the main variable explaining crosssectional differences in unsecured debts. The increase in aggregate unsecured debt between 1995 and 2000 does not seem to be closely linked to changes in the determinants of debt market participation and has been mainly associated with the larger amounts borrowed by those with debts. Increases in income, better educational qualifications and improved prospects regarding the financial situation contributed to this result.

This analysis suggests that the main factors causing debt problems are the unsecured debt-income ratio, the level of mortgage income gearing, the level of financial wealth of households, their health, ethnicity and marital status. While the proportion of households reporting debt problems did not change between 1995 and 2000, there were important shifts among different groups. In particular, more households in the youngest age group reported debt repayments were a heavy burden in 2000, while the opposite applies to the oldest age group where a smaller proportion of households than in 1995 reported debt was a heavy burden. These changes can largely be accounted for by the changing economic circumstances of these groups rather than an unrelated shift in attitudes. In particular, the increase in indebtedness of the young was the main factor accounting for their greater tendency to report debt problems."

But short-term risk neutral default probabilities behave quite differently, implying that there are periods of market-wide changes in volatility that do not show in measures of average spreads.

The way firms cope with financial constraints is fundamental to the analysis of monetary transmission, of financial stability and of economic growth and development. The CBI Industrial Trends Survey contains detailed information on the financial constraints faced by a large sample of UK manufacturers. This paper uses the quarterly CBI Industrial Trends Survey firm-level data between January 1989 and October 1999. The cleaned sample contains 49,244 quarterly observations on 5,196 firms. The data set is presented and a new method of checking the informational content of the data is developed. The relationship between investment activity and financial constraints is ambivalent because both can affect each other and they are affected by the same kind of economic developments, so it is not clear which is driving the other. But the link between financial constraints faced by the firm and the prevalence and duration of capacity restrictions should be unambiguously positive. Looking at that relationship, two important results emerge. First, financially constrained firms take longer to close capacity gaps. This indicates that financial constraints do indeed play a part in the investment process. Second, small firms close their capacity gaps faster than large firms do, but financial constraints seem to be of higher relevance to their adjustment."

The dataset is for 34 industries covering the whole economy, of which 31 industries are in the market sector. Using growth accounting, we find that ICT capital accounted for 13% of productivity growth in the market sector in 1970-79 (ie 0.47 percentage points out of 3.62% per annum growth of GDP per hour), 26% in 1979-90, and 28% in 1990-2000.

ICT capital, despite only being a small fraction of the total capital stock, contributed as much to growth as non-ICT capital in 1990-2000 and getting on for twice as much in 1995-2000. Econometric evidence also supports an important role for ICT. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth slowed down in 1995-2000, but we find econometric evidence that a boom in 'complementary investment', ie expenditure on reorganisation that accompanies ICT investment but is not officially measured as investment, could have led to a decline in the conventional measure of TFP growth."

The results are applied to an analysis of total factor productivity (TFP) growth. That analysis is focused on the 1990s - a period when the growth rate of the standard measure of TFP fell in the United Kingdom, while rising sharply in the United States. The estimates suggest that capital adjustment costs accounted for around two thirds of the observed slowdown in UK TFP growth.

One potential reason was that the models they were using were insufficiently disaggregated. In this paper, an empirical model is estimated whose out-of-sample forecasts largely predicted the global investment boom of the late 1990s. The main factor behind the improved model performance is the distinction between investment in ICT assets and investment in other assets, using disaggregated investment data provided by the OECD. In line with previous studies on US and UK investment performance, ICT investment is estimated to be much more responsive to changes in the real user cost of capital. In particular, panel and seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimates suggest very strong relative price effects on ICT investment for all G7 countries and Australia. The data also allow an examination of the effects of possible deflator mismeasurement; but within our framework, the measurement of investment using harmonised, rather than national, deflators is not found to have a material impact on forecasting performance."

Comparing the reactions in financial markets to announcements before and after the Bank of England's operational independence,"255, Bank of England.","The subject of this paper is how the increase in transparency brought about by the Bank of England's operational independence has changed the way in which markets react immediately after economic announcements. Other things being equal, the increase in transparency of the new framework will make monetary policy more predictable once the latest macroeconomic data are known. On this view, the market will be less sensitive to interest rate decisions and more sensitive to macroeconomic data releases. Previous research on the subject showed a more muted reaction to macroeconomic releases in the United Kingdom after 1997, and suggested that markets were still learning the rules of the new monetary framework. With two more years of data and a complementary analysis of trading activity, this study finds that macroeconomic announcements continue to move the markets less in the post-independence period, and interest rate changes the same or more. A separate analysis of the surprise announcements and the surprise component of each announcement reveals a similar pattern. Nor is the possibly greater impact of international announcements - another candidate explanation - borne out by the data. Finally, the paper finds that the reactions to macroeconomic announcements are in fact stronger in the second half than in the first half of the post-independence period. An increase in transparency is not the only change brought about by operational independence. Among other things, the collective nature of the Monetary Policy Committee and a perceived shift towards a more implicit policy rule since operational independence may have made its decisions harder to anticipate, thus decreasing the response to macroeconomic releases and increasing the reaction to monetary policy decisions."

 """,2005.,Real-Time Gross Settlement and hybrid payment systems: a comparison,"252, Bank of England.","This paper contrasts Real-Time Gross Settlement and hybrid payment systems that are based on payment offset, using a two-period, multi-bank model. The comparison is performed according to two criteria: liquidity needs and speed of settlement. We assume that the existence of a payment is common knowledge but that the specific degree of time-criticality of a payment is the private information of the bank sending the payment. Hybrid payment systems are shown to outperform Real-Time Gross Settlement when payments are offset in the first period and when they are offset in both periods. This suggests that in a hybrid system, the offsetting facility should be in operation all day, or, at the very least, for some time after the system opens in the morning. A system in which the offsetting facility was only switched on late in the day would not necessarily be preferred to Real-Time Gross Settlement. These results are shown to be robust to changes in the transparency of the central queue of payments awaiting offset. However, this robustness may not hold with different forms of information asymmetry."

 """,2005.,The stock market and capital accumulation: an application to UK data,"251, Bank of England.","Because of the difficulty in measuring investment in intangible assets and frequent data revisions, estimates based on National Accounts investment data provide an imperfect measure of the capital stock. Following the influential work by Robert Hall for the United States, this paper provides an alternative measure of the UK capital stock based on asset prices. This market-based measure reflects the premise that in fair-valued financial markets the value of firms' securities reflects the value of their productive assets. In line with Hall's results for the United States, the paper suggests that for a range of adjustment costs, depreciation rates and starting values, market-based estimates of the UK capital stock have differed substantially from those based on National Accounts investment data. Despite some advantages over National Accounts based measures, market-based measures are likely to be more volatile, because financial markets' assessment of the value of intangible assets can potentially change rapidly. Nevertheless, they can be a useful cross-check of the National Accounts based measures of the UK capital stock."

The model relates this stochastic discount factor to the real return on a 'worldwide' stock portfolio, with the model parameters varying with variations in the slope of the 'world' term structure of interest rates. Econometric tests indicate that this model is accepted by the data. The corresponding parameter estimates are used to compute the risk premium for the three aforementioned sterling exchange rates. A graphical analysis indicates that, in terms of magnitude, our measure of the exchange rate risk premium is mainly of importance for the sterling/Deutsche mark exchange rate.

 """,2005.,Optimal collective action clause thresholds,"249, Bank of England.","Since February 2003 a number of debtor countries have issued bonds with collective action clauses (CACs) under New York law - a development welcomed by the official sector as tangible progress towards more orderly crisis resolution. Not all of these countries, however, have opted for the same CAC voting threshold, raising concerns that lack of standardisation might undermine the wider adoption of CACs. In this paper, debtors' optimal choice of CAC threshold is analysed using a theoretical model of 'grey-zone' financial crisis, which allows for the interaction of liquidity problems with solvency problems. It finds that individual countries may wish to set different thresholds because of differing risk preferences and creditworthiness. Strongly risk-averse debtors put much greater weight on pay-offs during crisis periods than during non-crisis periods and are therefore more likely to choose lower CAC thresholds than less risk-averse debtors. The worse the creditworthiness of risk-averse debtors, however, the more likely they will want to issue bonds with high collective action clauses."

Cyclical changes in competitiveness are also considered, since it is not clear empirically whether changes in competitiveness have been predominantly structural or cyclical. A model based on work by Woodford is used, allowing for positive trend inflation and cyclical variations in competitiveness in a tractable manner. This extension enables the separate quantification of the impact of differences in the steady-state level of and cyclical changes in competitiveness on inflation in the short term, in high and low inflation environments. The paper quantifies the extent to which procyclical (countercyclical) changes in competitiveness dampen (amplify) the impulse responses of inflation to a given monetary policy shock. In the calibration used, the inflation response to monetary policy shocks in a low inflation/high competitiveness environment is dampened compared with a high inflation/low competitiveness environment. By contrast, inflation responses to monetary policy shocks in a low inflation/low competitiveness environment are similar to those in a high inflation/high competitiveness environment."

The paper considers various empirical specifications that are consistent with the Campbell and Shiller model and finds that they are supported by UK equity data. In particular, there is weak evidence that the dividend yield has predictive ability for long-horizon excess returns.

First, it shows that wealth effects mean that consumption is much more likely to be negatively related to interest rates than the simple two-period textbook model might suggest.

 """,2004.,Core inflation: a critical guide,"242, Bank of England.","The term 'core inflation' is widely used by academics and central bankers. But despite its prevalence, there is neither a commonly accepted theoretical definition nor an agreed method of measuring it. The range of conceptual bases is potentially confusing, and can make the large number of available measures of core inflation difficult to interpret, particularly when they display different trends. Nevertheless, measures of core inflation can be helpful if they increase the signal to noise ratio in measured inflation. This paper examines a range of measures of core inflation for the United Kingdom, both conceptually and empirically, setting out their motivation and highlighting their potential limitations. No single measure performs well across the board, but a compromise conclusion on the usefulness of measures of core inflation is that each one may provide a different insight into the inflation process. There can be value in looking at a range of measures, as long as one bears in mind what information each type of indicator is best at providing. When all measures are giving the same message then, in a sense, monetary policy makers can reasonably consider that these measures are providing a reliable guide to inflationary pressures. It is when the measures start to diverge that policymakers need to take a much closer look at the reasons for those divergences."

Such improvements in predictability could arise from greater transparency in the monetary policy process, together with greater credibility of the Bank of England. Empirical tests, using a simple term structure model, show that predictability has indeed improved over the sample period as a whole, and most markedly after the introduction of inflation targeting in 1992. But closer inspection of the data reveals that predictability did not rise smoothly over time, nor is it possible to generalise this result across maturities. Furthermore, attempts to identify structural breakpoints in a formal way were on the whole unsuccessful. Nonetheless, the paper concludes that, over the longer sample period, the data show a clear improvement in the ability of market participants to predict policy rate changes by the Bank of England."

This paper considers the implications of this structural change on short-run inflation dynamics, and for assessing shocks to inflation and output. The importance of firms' price-setting behaviour is highlighted in this context using a standard New Keynesian model with microfoundations. It is well known that both Rotemberg and Calvo price-setting assumptions imply the same reduced-form New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC). Increased competition among firms, however, increases price flexibility in the former, and has either no effect or decreases price flexibility in the latter. The effects of mark-up shocks on inflation and output are small when firms' price-setting behaviour incorporates concerns about potential loss of market share. These effects are further dampened in an environment of more intense competition. Under the assumption of increased competition, both models lead to unambiguous predictions about the direction of change in the slope of the Phillips curve. Rolling estimates of the NKPC indicate that the slope has declined or flattened for several countries since the 1990s. This evidence is consistent with the prediction of the Calvo model."

It illustrates a trade-off that confronts forecasters and policymakers when they use data that are measured with error. On the one hand, observations on recent data give valuable clues as to the shocks that are hitting the system and that will be propagated into the variables to be forecast. But on the other, those recent observations are likely to be those least well measured. The paper studies two classes of forecasting problem. The first class includes cases where the forecaster takes the coefficients in the data-generating process as given, and has to choose how much of the historical time series of data to use to form a forecast. We show that if recent data are sufficiently badly measured, relative to older data, it can be optimal not to use recent data at all. The second class of problems we study is more general. We show that for a general class of linear autoregressive forecasting models, the optimal weight to place on a data observation of some age, relative to the weight in the true data-generating process, will depend on the measurement error in that observation. We illustrate the gains in forecasting performance using a model of UK business investment growth."

The three policies are: (1) the optimal non-inertial rule; (2) the optimal history-dependent rule; (3) the optimal price level targeting rule. Under rational expectations rules (2) and (3) both implement the fully optimal equilibrium by improving the output/inflation trade-off. When imperfect information about the model parameters is introduced, the central bank makes monetary policy mistakes, which affect welfare to a different degree under the three rules. The optimal history-dependent rule is worst affected and delivers the lowest welfare. Price level targeting performs best under learning and maintains the advantages of conducting policy under commitment. These findings are related to the literature on feedback control and robustness. The paper argues that adopting integral representations of rules designed under full information is desirable, because these rules deliver the beneficial output/inflation trade-off of commitment policy, while being robust to implementation errors."

Recent research that uses US data from three time-use surveys has found evidence for a large downward bias to the labour supply elasticity. This paper uses a large UK survey to test this hypothesis. It finds convincing evidence for a similar downward bias in estimates of the UK labour supply elasticity for males. The analysis is extended by differentiating by sex, marital status, skill and business cycle. The bias appears in every case, but is less evident for married men. The labour supply elasticity for single women is, interestingly, similar to that for single men."

Empirical evidence suggests that the most recent decade, associated with the introduction of an inflation-targeting regime, has been significantly more stable than the previous post-WWII era. For real GDP growth, and for three measures of inflation, break dates are identified at around the time of the introduction of inflation-targeting, in October 1992. For all four series, the estimated innovation variance over the most recent subperiod has been the lowest of the post-WWII era. The volatility of the band-pass filtered macroeconomic indicators considered has been, after 1992, almost always lower than either during the Bretton Woods regime or the 1971-92 period; often, as in the cases of inflation and real GDP, markedly so. The Phillips correlation appears to have undergone significant changes over the past 50 years, from being unstable in the 1970s, to slowly stabilising from the beginning of the 1980s onwards. After 1992, the correlation has exhibited by far the greatest degree of stability during the post-WWII era."

The paper analyses the implications of these estimated policy rules for real exchange rate behaviour in an open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The analysis shows that real exchange rate persistence could be attributed to the persistence of real shocks and interest rate smoothing behaviour of central banks.

 """,2004.,Financial interlinkages in the United Kingdom's interbank market and the risk of contagion,"230, Bank of England.","A well functioning interbank market is essential for efficient financial intermediation. But interbank exposures imply the possibility of direct contagion: the insolvency of a single institution may trigger multiple bank failures due to direct credit exposures. The complete network of interbank exposures that gives rise to this channel of contagion is not observable, making it difficult to assess the systemic risk it poses. This paper uses data on loans and deposits between UK-resident banks to estimate the distribution of bilateral exposures. The potential for contagion is examined by assuming the sudden failure of each individual bank and estimating the losses incurred to other banks as a result of the initial shock. This study suggests that, while a single bank failure is rarely sufficient to trigger the outright failure of other banks, it does have the potential to weaken substantially the capital holdings of the banking system. And, when the failure of a single bank does result in knock-on effects, their severity depends greatly on the maintained assumptions about the distribution of interbank loans and the level of loss given default. But data constraints mean that drawing definitive conclusions is difficult."

In particular, the various banking crisis resolution techniques available to the authorities are classified and then compared with the techniques that have been used in practice, drawing on both the available evidence and our own analysis. With individual bank failures the authorities usually first seek a private sector solution. Any losses are passed on to existing shareholders, managers and sometimes uninsured creditors, and not to taxpayers. But policy options are more limited in systemwide crises. In most recent systemwide crises, early on central banks have provided liquidity to failing banks and governments have given blanket guarantees to depositors. In nearly all cases, investor panics have been quelled but at a cost to the budget and increasing the risk of future moral hazard. Open-ended central bank liquidity support seems to have prolonged crises, thus increasing rather than reducing the output costs to the economy. Bank restructuring has usually occurred through mergers, often government assisted, and some government capital injection or increase in control. Bank liquidations have been rare and creditors - including uninsured ones - have rarely made losses. In systemwide crises, resolution measures have been more successful in financial restructuring than in restoring banks' ongoing profitability or credit to the private sector. In most cases bank lending has remained subdued for years after a banking crisis."

It differs in allowing for the degree of price stickiness to be determined endogenously. A closed-form solution for short-term inflation is derived from the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with state-dependent pricing originally developed by Dotsey, King and Wolman. This generalised Phillips curve encompasses the New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) based on Calvo-type price-setting as a special case. It describes current inflation as a function of lagged inflation, expected future inflation, and current and expected future real marginal costs. The paper demonstrates that inflation dynamics generated by the model for a broad class of time and state-dependent price-setting behaviours are well approximated by the popular hybrid NKPC (with one lag of inflation) in a low-inflation environment. This provides an explanation of why the hybrid NKPC performs well in describing inflation dynamics across industrial countries. It implies, however, that the reduced-form coefficients of the hybrid NKPC may not have a structural interpretation."

 """,2004.,Exploring the relationship between credit spreads and default probabilities,"225, Bank of England.","Contrary to theory, recent empirical work suggests that changing default expectations can explain only a fraction of the variability in credit spreads. This paper takes a fresh look at this question, relating credit spreads for a sample of investment-grade bonds issued by UK industrial companies to default probabilities generated by the Bank of England's Merton model of corporate failure. For the highest quality corporate issues, where the probability of default is low, this factor explains relatively little of the variation in credit spreads. For such bonds, common market factors - perhaps related to liquidity conditions - appear to be of greater importance. This is consistent with previous empirical work. For lower-rated investment-grade bonds, however, the probability of default is found to be a more important determinant of credit spreads, explaining around a third of variability in a pooled regression. When coefficients are allowed to vary at the level of the individual issue, explanatory power rises to 50% for this group. This is much higher than previous studies have found, reflecting both the more direct application of the Merton model and the recognition that idiosyncrasies in factors such as liquidity conditions and expected recovery rates are likely to undermine results from pooled estimation."

 """,2004.,The informational content of empirical measures of real interest rate and output gaps for the United Kingdom,"224, Bank of England.","In many economies, the monetary policy instrument is the level of short-term nominal interest rates, but the monetary policy stance might be better characterised by the ex-ante real interest rate that this nominal rate implies, relative to some 'neutral' or 'natural' real rate of interest. In this paper, the natural rate of interest and the real interest rate gap - the difference between the actual and the natural real rate of interest - are estimated by applying Kalman filtering techniques to a small-scale macroeconomic model of the UK economy. In this model, the real interest rate gap, the output gap and inflation are related via IS-curve and Phillips-curve relationships. The natural rate of interest is defined as the level of (ex-ante) real interest rates that is consistent with an output gap of zero, that is output at its natural level, in the medium term. Based on these estimates, the paper examines whether empirical measures of the real interest rate gap are a useful tool for policymakers - do they contain additional information relative to the estimated output gap, and does the real rate gap have leading indicator properties for the output gap and inflation? Are these gap estimates of practical use in a policy setting? The paper finds that the real rate gap has leading indicator properties for both the output gap and inflation. Importantly, these properties have varied considerably over time: breaking the sample into four subsamples, it appears that the leading indicator properties for both the output and real rate gap were substantially stronger for the subsample that covers most of the 1980s. After the introduction of the inflation target, post 1992, the relationship between the real interest rate gap and the output gap strengthens, but the leading indicator properties of these gaps for inflation diminish, as might be expected under an inflation-targeting regime."

Recent work on measurement error in the Q model casts doubt on this interpretation. It is possible that the Q model may not be identified if there are 'bubbles' in stock market valuations that are both persistent over time and that are correlated with fundamental values. Cash flow may then provide additional information about expected profitability that is not captured by a poorly measured Tobin's average Q variable. This hypothesis is explored empirically using UK panel data on companies for which analysts' earnings forecasts are available from the IBES database. The results point to a severe measurement error in average Q. The paper finds that, controlling for expected profitability using analysts' earnings forecasts, cash flow becomes insignificant. Both sales growth and cash-stock variables do provide additional information, which could either be capturing expectations of profitability at longer horizons, or reflect misspecification of the basic Q model. Results for subsamples do not suggest financing constraints as a likely explanation for these findings."

This effect is estimated to be greater for the young, those without non-labour income and manual workers, a pattern also consistent with the predictions of precautionary saving models. The paper then studies the propensity for households to purchase durable goods and finds durables purchases to be delayed significantly by higher unemployment risk. The paper therefore demonstrates that job insecurity affects aggregate demand through both non-durable and durable expenditure, controlling for other influences including estimated permanent income."

Theoretical considerations,"219, Bank of England.","This paper assesses various crisis resolution proposals using a theoretical model of (liquidity and solvency) crisis. The model suggests that payments standstills and last-resort lending are equally efficient means of dealing with liquidity crises, while coordinated lending through creditor committees is second best. Debt write-downs are preferred to subsidised IMF financing when dealing with solvency crises, because of the negative moral hazard implications of the latter tool. Finally, the model suggests that international bankruptcy court proposals may be superior to existing contractual approaches in securing such write-downs."

In this paper this remarkable decline is explored, and the roles played by the interaction of skills, long-term sickness and the disability benefit system are highlighted. The analysis shows that the decline in participation was almost exclusively among unskilled males and that this same group reported increasing long-term illness. The generosity of the disability insurance system relative to that of the unemployment insurance appears to have encouraged such workers to exit the labour market. Strong evidence is presented of sizable labour supply responses to disability insurance benefits, which would support that hypothesis. But it seems unlikely that this 1990s' experience will be repeated as disability benefits are now much less generous than they were at that time."

A new test of creditor moral hazard is developed, which uses some new data and some more stringent identifying restrictions. The test examines the response of the market valuation of UK banks to IMF loan packages. It finds a significant positive response for UK banks, with abnormal returns of over 1% in a number of cases. These excess returns are greater, the larger is the IMF package and the larger is the size of the creditor banks' emerging market portfolio. This effect is significant even once the potentially welfare-enhancing effect of IMF loans in offsetting overpricing problems in international capital markets is controlled for. In short, concrete evidence is found of creditor-side moral hazard associated with IMF support."

A model,"215, Bank of England.","This paper presents a model to explain how IMF programmes can catalyse private capital flows following a financial crisis, a concept that was at the heart of the IMF's strategy for dealing with capital account crises in the late 1990s. In the model, the IMF lends funds below the prevailing market interest rate and it is this subsidy that induces the borrowing country to exert adjustment effort to avoid default. By preventing default, future marginal rates of return on investment are kept high, thereby encouraging private capital flows. The IMF may also have a signalling role if it has superior information about debtor type and can affect the interest rate charged in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. In practice, however, IMF programmes based on the catalytic approach have been disappointing and actual private capital flows have been considerably below those projected. Therefore, the paper also considers how capital flows derived from the model are sensitive to the assumptions made. The paper concludes by discussing the policy implications of the analysis for IMF programme design."

 """,2004.,An empirical model of household arrears,"214, Bank of England.","Household arrears on payment obligations are one of the most direct measures of household sector financial stress. In this paper a time series approach is used to model two of the key components of aggregate UK household arrears: those on mortgages and credit cards. Mortgages are the main component of secured borrowing by households and credit cards are a key element in unsecured borrowing. Recent data show that both secured and unsecured debt have risen substantially, both absolutely and as a proportion of income since 1997. Unsecured debt has increased more rapidly over this period and so has become more important in overall household debt. During this period of rapid debt accumulation, the proportion of mortgage loans in arrears has fallen but the value of credit card arrears relative to the value of active card balances has risen. These differences in the behaviour of arrears are explained by reference to the underlying driving forces identified in previous empirical work. In particular the level of housing equity appears to be more important in explaining mortgage arrears, and the role of supply factors is highlighted for credit card arrears. Although the estimated models confirm that both income and interest repayments (and therefore income gearing) are important factors in explaining both forms of arrears, unemployment only plays an additional role for mortgage arrears. Joint testing of the two models suggests a role for the ratio of the value of the mortgage loan to the value of housing equity for both kinds of arrears, but with opposing effects. In the case of mortgage arrears this might reflect the lenders' perceptions of the quality of the borrower. Credit card arrears appear to contain some information about future mortgage arrears although the reverse does not hold. Both equations adjust relatively quickly to any shocks, typically in around two years. The significance of the income-gearing term for both types of arrears underlines the importance of the path of interest rates for the financial position of the UK household sector."

Empirically, they claim that the proportion of US growth accounted for by embodiment is about twice as large as estimated by conventional growth accounting.

These are used to calculate each company's debt at risk: the probability of failure multiplied by its outstanding debt. By summing the firm-level debt at risk over all companies it is possible to produce an aggregate measure of financial risk that takes account of how debt is distributed across individual companies. Aggregate debt at risk, as a percentage of total debt, has fallen from the levels reached in the early 1990s and has remained relatively stable despite the build-up in corporate debt since then."

It is shown that two types of outcome are possible - inefficient or efficient - depending on whether banks care about payments imbalances between them in the first period. If they do, banks delay payments to each other, increasing their aggregate liquidity requirements. It is argued that efficiency is not guaranteed even when banks face repeated interaction in a real payment system, largely because of imperfect information and the competitive dynamics of the payment industry. An efficient outcome can be achieved by the imposition of throughput rules on the value of payments banks must make by a certain deadline. These can both reduce aggregate liquidity requirements and increase the contestability of the payments market, encouraging a higher degree of direct access to payment systems. Throughput rules could therefore also have risk-reduction benefits if they help to reduce the level of tiering in the financial system. The detailed characteristics of these rules are shown to be important, and a number of design issues are addressed, such as how frequently requirements should be set, and whether throughput rules should apply on an aggregate or bilateral basis."

There is little previous empirical literature. But where there is, models have either studied particular markets or have developed single-equation approaches. Lack of suitable data has been a major impediment. A model of the real estate sector is constructed using econometric analysis of rental values and bank lending, supplemented by a calibrated model of the remainder of the financial accounts of real estate companies (using data for private and public real estate companies). Using related work on company-failure models, it is possible to extend the analysis to provide an equation for the probability of default of real estate companies. The empirical results fail to find a role for borrowing costs in the bank lending equation before 1999, but unless borrowing costs are included after this period, the equation breaks down and systematically underestimates the growth in lending to real estate from then on. Various potential explanations are examined for this breakdown, including the importance of sale and lease-backs. The estimated rental equation appears more stable. The historical tracking performance of the estimated real estate model fails to capture the full extent of the swings in capital values and bank lending in the early 1990s. This is attributed to shifts in the discount rate applied to property income, possibly reflecting a temporary shift in risk premia during this period. The property sector links to the rest of the private non-financial corporate sector through its role as collateral. Since the property model relies partly on macroeconomic influences it can be used in conjunction with macro models to provide forecasts of property values and the probability of default of property companies. Simulations that use this model with the Bank of England macroeconometric model show not only the sensitivity of the probability of default of real estate companies to selected macroeconomic shocks, but also the potential links between the commercial property sector and the financial health of the rest of the corporate sector."

The model explains indebtedness in terms of a consumption-income motive, associated with consumption smoothing, and a housing-finance motive. A credit constraint on borrowing by the old is also introduced to explain why they do not borrow to finance homeownership late in life. Shocks to real interest rates and income growth expectations, combined with demographic changes, are considered to explain the rise in US household debt. The calibrated model is found to be able to explain many features of US household borrowing, both in aggregate and cross-section. In particular, it predicts that the debt to income ratio would have increased substantially during the 1990s and would be expected to continue to grow in coming years. However, the model is unable to account for rising indebtedness during the 1980s when high interest rates, lower income growth and an ageing population would have tended to reduce aggregate borrowing. Alternative explanations, possibly associated with financial liberalisation, may account for borrowing growth during that period."

The panel is estimated using the pooled mean group technique of Pesaran, Shin and Smith. This is essentially a dynamic error correction model where cross-sectional coefficients are allowed to vary in the short run but are required to be homogeneous in the long run. It allows a separation of short-run dynamics and adjustment towards the equilibrium. The model is used to benchmark market spreads and assess whether sovereign risk was overpriced or underpriced during different periods over the past decade. The results suggest that a debtor country's fundamentals and external liquidity conditions are important determinants of market spreads. However, the diagnostic statistics also indicate that the market assessment of a country's creditworthiness is more broad based than that provided by the set of fundamentals included in the model. It is found that the generalised fall in sovereign spreads seen between 1995 and 1997 cannot be entirely explained in terms of improved fundamentals."

 """,2003.,The dynamics of consumers' expenditure: the UK consumption ECM redux,"204, Bank of England.","Simple intertemporal consumption theory implies that non-durable consumption is a random walk, but that consumption cointegrates with income and wealth. By the Granger representation theorem, there must be a (vector) error correction mechanism ((V)ECM) representation of the data; but from the theory, the equilibrating ECM cannot be in consumption. Instead, even with generalisations such as habit persistence, this equilibration should take place via income or wealth. Furthermore, unless the relative price of durables and non-durables is constant, the relative price needs to be taken into account in modelling. In this paper, the short-run dynamics and long-run relationship between non-durable consumption, non-asset income, wealth and the relative price of durable goods are examined. A cointegrating relationship is found to exist. Estimating VECMs, it is found that the adjustment towards the long-run common trend does indeed occur partly via changes in wealth, consistent with forward-looking behaviour on the part of agents. The result implies that consumption will predict asset returns, and this is confirmed by a regression of excess equity returns on the lagged disequilibrium term. A decomposition of shocks hitting the system reveals that between 30% and 90% of fluctuations in non-human wealth are transitory. Even if the lower figure applies, this means a substantial part of short-term fluctuations in wealth is decoupled from permanent consumption."

This is no longer the case, however, when the benefits from reaching a restructuring agreement are private information to the debtor and its creditors.

In particular, the question of whether credit spreads are a reliable indicator of corporate bond default risk is examined. Using daily price quotes from 1990 to 1998, a small negative relationship is identified between credit spreads on sterling investment-grade corporate bonds and the level and slope of the term structure of UK interest rates. The results are weaker than those found by some previous studies which examined the relationship between US corporate bond credit spreads and the term structure of US interest rates. The weakness of the relationship suggests that credit spreads on sterling investment-grade corporate bonds have been driven by factors other than default risk. If so, we should be cautious in interpreting such credit spreads as measures of bond default risk. This result is important to both those in the field of financial stability interested in leading indicators of corporate defaults, and to monetary policy makers interested in the impact of interest rate changes on corporate bond default risk. Similar work should be repeated for sterling sub investment-grade corporate bonds once a sufficiently large data set can be assembled."

It is found that the basic (power utility) version of the consumption-based model suffers from the standard problems outlined in the literature, so the basic framework is augmented to allow for (external) habit formation in consumption, and a general k -period real interest rate is derived. Interestingly, although the different approaches outlined above can sometimes yield very different estimates of real interest rates, all the measures move more closely together during the post-1992 inflation-targeting period than before.

Such diversification is either justified (by the bank) or welcomed (by commentators), or both, as reducing the bank's exposure to risk. Diversification across various sources of earnings is welcomed for, it is claimed, diversification reduces risk. Whether it does of course depends on how independent of each other the various earnings sources are. Traditionally fee income has been very stable; but, also traditionally, it has been a small part of the earnings stream of most banks. Has non-interest income remained stable, or at least uncorrelated with interest income, as banks have increased its importance in their earnings? This paper examines the variability of interest and non-interest income, and their correlation, for the banking systems of EU countries for the years 1994-98. It is found that the increased importance of non-interest income did, for most but not all categories of bank, stabilise profits in the European banking industry in those years. It is not, however, invariably more stable than interest income."

From the capital accumulation identity, it also follows that the capital stock and investment have a long-run proportional relationship. The dynamic structure thus implies a multi-cointegrating framework, in which separate cointegrating relationships are identifiable. This has been used to justify the estimation of investment equations embodying a reduced-form long-run relationship between investment and output (rather than between the capital stock and output). In this paper, a new investment equation is estimated in the full structural framework, exploiting a measure of the capital stock constructed by the Bank, and a long series for the cost of capital. A CES production function is assumed, and a well-determined estimate of the elasticity of substitution is obtained by a variety of measures. The robust result is that the elasticity of substitution is significantly different from unity (the Cobb-Douglas case), at about 0.45. Overidentifying restrictions on the long-run relationship are all accepted. Although the key long-run parameter (the elasticity of substitution) is highly robust to alternative specifications, single-equation investment relationships may obscure the dynamics. There is evidence that the Johansen method is oversized, but given this, a test for excluding the capital accumulation identity from the investment equation is much better than using a single-equation ECM."

These criteria lead to rather different conclusions. In sample, most labour market indicators appear to be statistically significant in an inflation-forecasting equation, but out of sample a much smaller number of labour market indicator models are better at forecasting inflation than a simple autoregression, with virtually none outperforming this benchmark over the period since 1995. The labour market indicator models that perform relatively well out of sample tend to be sensitive to the precise choice of inflation measure, sample period and estimation method, though there is some evidence that pooling across individual forecasts produces more reliable results. One apparently robust result, however, is that the unemployment rate gap, the most commonly used measure of labour market tightness, performs poorly in out-of-sample forecasts across a range of specifications."

Non-traded goods producers face costs of adjusting their capital stocks and can only reset their prices once a year in a staggered fashion. It is shown that the model is able to replicate the stylised facts found in the empirical exercise. It is then shown how asset prices respond to shocks to productivity in the traded, non-traded and household production sectors and a shock to the world price of traded goods. With these results, it is possible to assess what information asset prices may give us about the shocks affecting the economy at any particular time."

Measuring labour availability in the UK","186, Bank of England.","The unemployment rate is commonly assumed to measure labour availability, but this ignores the fact that potential workers frequently come from outside the current set of labour market participants, the so-called inactive. The UK Longitudinal Labour Force Survey includes information that can be used to predict impending employment transitions. Using this unique dataset, new measures of labour availability, and indicators based on the more familiar unemployment rate alternatives, can be constructed and are reported here. The micro and macroeconomic performance of these labour force availability measures are compared. Two simplified models, which include several categories of reasons for not working as well as demographic variables, perform particularly well in all of the tests. The implications of these preferred models are further studied in the context of regional regressions and comparisons with alternative data sources. These results together illustrate the important role that some groups of the inactive can play as a source of potential workers."

 """,2003.,What does economic theory tell us about labour market tightness?,"185, Bank of England.","Labour market tightness is a phrase often used by commentators and policy-makers, but it is rarely defined. In this paper, the phrase labour market tightness is interpreted as describing the balance between the demand for, and the supply of, labour. A logical consequence of this approach is that tightness is not a helpful concept in those models of the labour market, such as the standard competitive and the basic matching model, where there are insufficient rigidities to create imbalances between labour demand and supply. It is proposed that changes in the labour share of income are a convenient yardstick for measuring changes in labour market tightness. In response to certain kinds of shock, changes in the labour share will give misleading signals, but this is likely to occur less frequently than with other oft-cited tightness indicators such as the unemployment rate or the employment rate. The paper concludes by considering the links between labour market tightness and inflation. A key lesson from this analysis is that any attempt to infer the relationships between labour market tightness, various market indicators of it, and inflation, requires both a clear definition of tightness and depends on the specific model of the labour market."

A simple model is developed here to examine the implications of standstills for yields and the maturity structure of debt. An emerging market country chooses to sell short and long-term debt to risk-neutral international investors. The key assumptions are that the level of short-term debt increases the probability of crisis, that crises have costs that spill over into the next period, and that the orderly resolution of financial crises will reduce the cost of crises. A standstill is depicted as an orderly rollover of short-term debt. Standstills have the benefit of reducing the proportion of short-term debt and so lower the probability of crisis. This comes at the cost of generally lower expected output."

Incomplete pass-through has typically been explained by a combination of sticky prices and pricing to market.

One implication for firms' import (and domestic) price setting is that competitors' prices might affect the mark-up, although this is not a necessary condition.

These will replace the relatively risk-invariant requirements in the current Accord. In this article the implications of this new risk-based regime for procyclicality of minimum capital requirements are examined - in particular, whether the choice of particular loan rating system by the banks would significantly increase the likelihood of sharp increases in capital requirements in recessions, creating the potential for classic credit crunches. It is found that rating schemes that are designed to be more stable over the cycle, akin to those of the external rating agencies, would not increase procyclicality, but ratings that are conditioned on the current point in the cycle, akin in some respects to a Merton approach, could substantially increase procyclicality. This makes the question of which rating schemes banks will use very important. A general equilibrium model of the financial system is used to explore whether banks would choose to use a countercyclical, procyclical or neutral rating scheme. The results indicate that banks would not choose a stable rating approach, which has important policy implications for the design of the Accord. It makes it important that banks are given incentives to adopt more stable rating schemes. This consideration has been reflected in the Committees latest proposals, in October 2002."

It was argued that this represented a new paradigm, enabling unemployment to remain low without igniting inflationary pressure. In this paper the evidence for a change in the relationship between inflation and unemployment is examined and the US experience compared with that of the United Kingdom within a common analytical framework. To that end, Phillips-curve models are employed based on estimates of time-varying NAIRUs, obtained using the Kalman filter. The impact of including explicit inflation expectations is also considered. This channel has not been explored in previous work based on Kalman filter estimates of the NAIRU for the United States and United Kingdom. Inflation expectations are found to play a particularly important role in the United States. When expectations are included there is still evidence that the NAIRU steadily declined during the late 1990s, although this decline in the US NAIRU is not found solely in the 1990s."

The resulting profiles suggest that the NAIRU peaked around the mid-1980s and fell back thereafter. Structural changes in the labour market have reduced inflationary pressure from that source, and we suggest that temporary effects from real import prices and real oil prices were an important additional downward influence on inflation in the latter half of the 1990s. Some of the uncertainties around our NAIRU estimates are shown. But, even though there may be uncertainty about exactly where the NAIRU is, a variety of models suggest that unemployment was below the NAIRU for much of the second half of the 1990s."

But there is theoretical ambiguity and a potential identification problem. Cointegrating techniques are used in an attempt to resolve this, using the most appropriate data set (producer prices). Some evidence is found for the existence of two long-run relationships. The first of these is interpretable as a price mark-up or factor demand relationship, and competitors' prices can be excluded from it. The second equation can be interpreted as a long-run equilibrium price relationship equating domestic and foreign prices. This raises the possibility that single-equation estimates indicating a role for foreign prices in domestic price determination may mislead. However, the results are for producer prices and may not necessarily be extended to other indices."

Fixed-event forecasts allow tests for whether expectations are unbiased in a similar fashion to the rest of the literature.

The model is a simplified version of the real world consisting of a non-bank private sector, banks, a central bank, a government and a regulator. It is used to analyse actions by policy-makers and to identify policy relevant empirical work. Key analytical results are: a financially fragile system need not collapse; efficiency can be improved with policy intervention; and a system with heterogeneous banks is more stable than one with homogeneous ones. Existence of monetary equilibria allows for positive default levels in equilibrium. It also characterises contagion and financial fragility as an equilibrium phenomenon. A definition of financial fragility is proposed. Financial fragility occurs when aggregate profitability of the banking sector declines and defaults in the non-bank and banking private sectors increase. Thus, equilibria with financial fragility require financial vulnerability in the banking sector and liquidity shortages in the non-bank private sector. The model will be used as a basis to carry out empirical work on the costs of financial instability, to quantify the effectiveness of particular regulatory tools such as capital requirements, and to identify trade-offs between increasing stability through action by authorities and the efficiency of the financial system."

 """,2003.,Money market operations and volatility of UK money market rates,"174, Bank of England.","In this paper, the question of whether in the United Kingdom the choice of the operational framework for monetary policy has been systematically related to patterns in money market rates is examined. Attention is first focused on the Bank of England's policy target, the two-week repo rate. The tests indicate that tighter spreads between the two-week market rate and the official repo rate result in lower money market volatility at the very short end of the money market curve. The effects at the longer end are much weaker. But no evidence of transmission of two-week volatility along the money market curve is found. In contrast to many other central banks, the Bank of England does not employ an operating target for the overnight rate. No evidence is found that allowing greater variation in overnight rates undermines efforts of the central bank to keep other money market rates in alignment with the rate at which it operates when implementing its monetary policy. The results further indicate that volatility of rates at the very short end of the UK money market yield curve has declined significantly since the early 1990s. The introduction of the gilt repo market in January 1996 was associated with lower money market volatility, although there is evidence that volatility had started to fall as early as mid-1995. The effects of the 1997 reforms of the Bank of England's open market operations are less discernible in the data. In contrast, the creation of a ceiling for overnight rates in June 1998 was more clearly associated with a reduction in volatility of end-of-day overnight rates."

On the other hand, a stylised fact in international economics is that there is a disproportionately large share of domestic assets in investors' portfolios. If investment risk is high and diminishing returns are weak, then savings from temporary income shocks may, in fact, be invested according to the existing portfolio composition. This implies that any bias in portfolios persists after a temporary shock. A model is estimated that explicitly allows for the possibility that the impact of initial portfolio allocation, proxied using net foreign assets, may differ, depending on whether shocks are permanent or temporary. The results, from a panel of 18 OECD countries, suggest that initial portfolio allocation affects current account behaviour following temporary, but not permanent, shocks. These results are therefore compatible with the 'new rule'."

New evidence is provided that nominal asset owners are relatively more inflation averse, consistent with their exposure to unanticipated inflation. Second, the findings also suggest that economic context has a substantial impact on the public's economic objectives in a way broadly consistent with the specification of utility/loss functions in the theoretical political economy literature. Third, the results suggest that there is significant cross-country variation in inflation aversion, controlling for economic context and individual attributes, and that some of this variation can be accounted for by national-level factors affecting the aggregate costs of inflation and unemployment. Cross-country variation in inflation aversion, controlling for economic context has significant implications for both optimal monetary policy making and for models of alternative institutional frameworks for policy-making."

A general equilibrium model is considered, where asymmetric information problems create frictions in credit markets used by households. In particular, the financial accelerator mechanism of Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist is applied to the household sector. In the economy modelled, houses serve two purposes: they provide a stream of housing services to consumers, and they serve as collateral to lower the agency costs related to borrowing. It is shown that under certain conditions this amplifies and propagates the effect of monetary policy shocks on housing investment, house prices and consumption. The effect of a structural change in credit markets that lowers the transaction costs of additional borrowing against housing equity is also considered. It is shown that such a change would increase the effect of monetary policy shocks on consumption, but would decrease the effect of monetary policy shocks on house prices and housing investment."

 """,2002.,The role of short-run inflation targets and forecasts in disinflation,"167, Bank of England.","Globally, the majority of countries using inflation targets have done so when inflation was neither low nor stable. Many such countries have changed their target each year, and the empirical estimates reported in this paper support theoretical predictions that annual changes to the target are endogenous to outcomes. A unique cross-country panel dataset of inflation targets and outcomes in 60 countries in the 1990s is used. The estimates suggest the target revision may be predicted according to a simple 'forecasting' rule, and depends upon the outcome's deviation from both the short-run and long-run target. During disinflation, policy-makers may therefore be characterised as using two types of policy rule; one for setting interest rates, the other for revising annual targets. In designing roles for the legislator and the central bank in the monetary framework, it is necessary to take into account the likelihood that the process of setting the target may, in some circumstances, be inseparable from that of setting policy instruments. In the light of other literature, it is also argued that during disinflation, short-run targets may help central banks to build credibility because they may increase transparency."

The model's microeconomic contracting framework is used to generate specific financial scenarios, defined in terms of steady-state credit spreads, bank lending policies and corporate sector financial health. These scenarios are embedded in the macroeconomic BGG model, and an investigation carried out into how they affect dynamic responses of the real economy to monetary and real shocks. The simulations show that in the context of the BGG model, the balance sheet positions of the financial and non-financial corporate sectors can affect the monetary transmission mechanism. It is illustrated that in certain financial scenarios in the model the financial accelerator mechanism is very potent, whereas in others it has little incremental impact. This implies that, for a given shock, monetary policy can be less or more proactive, respectively. In addition, the model simulation results suggest that certain parameters may merit particular attention. For example, the sensitivity of bank lending policy to news about corporate financial health has an especially marked impact in the model's dynamics. And as illustrated in previous work, corporate leverage also plays an important role in amplifying and propagating shocks."

The results show that some of the benefit is related to the ability of committees to strip out the effect of bad play in any given period. But there is a significant additional improvement, which is argued to be associated with the ability of committee members to share information and learn from each other by observing other members' interest rate responses. One surprising result is that the superiority of committee decision-making does not appear to be related to the ability to discuss the interest rate decision."

 """,2002.,Understanding UK inflation: the role of openness,"164, Bank of England.","In this paper, inflation dynamics in the United Kingdom are re-examined. Standard specifications of traditional Phillips curves have tended to overpredict inflation in the recent low inflation, low unemployment era in the United States, the United Kingdom and the euro area. This has stimulated the 'New Phillips Curve' approach, which has had success for the United States and the euro area, both less open economies than the United Kingdom. The paper is divided into two parts. First, the overprediction problem is documented for the United Kingdom, and an attempt is made to solve it in a traditional Phillips curve framework by introducing external shocks (terms of trade shocks or domestically generated inflation). This does not fully solve the problem. It is argued that there is a further misspecification problem with traditional Phillips curve estimates, due to the presence of the regime changes and structural change in the UK economy. Second, 'New Phillips Curve' estimates are examined. They perform badly; real marginal cost is not significant in the baseline specification. The relationship between marginal cost and inflation disappears in the mid-1980s. When a labour share measure is used, real marginal cost becomes significant, but goodness of fit based on fundamental inflation remains poor. The 'New Phillips Curve' model is then extended to allow for open economy influences, taking into account imported intermediate goods. This is found to mitigate substantially the breakdown of the relationship between inflation and marginal cost. Fit improves, but a tendency to underpredict and then overpredict inflation remains. Finally, the open-economy measure of marginal cost is decomposed. The wage mark-up component is important and highly countercyclical. Relative price movements, of taxes relative to overall prices and of imported intermediate goods relative to wages, are found to have been a negative influence on marginal costs over the 1990s. Understanding likely future developments in these relative prices could contribute to the assessment of prospects for marginal costs and the pressures on inflation."

What sort of adjustment, if any, should be made for depreciation? While GDP is still appropriate as a measure of output, in this paper it is argued that NDP (WNDP)-nominal net domestic product deflated by the price index for consumption-is the appropriate measure of welfare. The rate at which the WNDP frontier is shifting out over time is analogous to the rate of growth of aggregate total factor productivity (TFP). Like the latter, it may be decomposed into the contributions made by TFP growth in individual industries, though with a different pattern of weights. The argument is illustrated by the experience of the United States in the 1990s. Here net investment increased more rapidly than gross investment and both grew faster than GDP, while the aggregate depreciation rate rose. Nevertheless the aggregate capital stock grew more slowly than GDP, and depreciation as a proportion of GDP was flat. Both official NDP and WNDP have been growing a little more slowly than GDP. But the acceleration of WNDP post 1995 was as great as that of GDP. Also, the rise in the growth rate of the WNDP frontier was equal to that of aggregate TFP."

 """,2002.,Factor utilisation and productivity estimates for the United Kingdom,"162, Bank of England.","In this paper series are derived for capital utilisation, labour effort and total factor productivity (TFP) from a general equilibrium model with variable factor utilisation and labour adjustment costs. Impulse responses from the model show that firms initially respond to unanticipated shocks by altering factor utilisation rates. In subsequent periods, firms adjust observable inputs such as physical capital and employment. As a result, utilisation rates are a leading indicator of firms hiring of both capital and labour. The estimate of capital utilisation is found to track survey-based measures quite closely, while movements in total hours worked drive the labour effort series. The estimate of TFP growth is found to be less cyclical than the rate of growth of a traditional Solow residual. Nevertheless, a weighted average of capital utilisation and labour effort - aggregate factor utilisation - is not closely related to the detrended Solow residual. This suggests that measures that conflate capacity utilisation and temporary deviations in TFP from its steady-state growth rate may be misleading indicators of excess demand pressure. Rather, the measure of aggregate factor utilisation is correlated with detrended labour productivity, providing more evidence that differences in average and marginal labour productivity may be linked to factor hoarding. Labour productivity, when calculated as output per unit of effective labour input, is less cyclical than a simple measure of output per hour."

 """,2002.,Regulatory and 'economic' solvency standards for internationally active banks,"161, Bank of England.","One of the most important policy issues for financial authorities is to decide at what level average capital charges should be set. The decision may alternatively be expressed as the choice of an appropriate survival probability for representative banks over a horizon such as a year, often termed a solvency standard. In this paper, light is shed on the solvency standards implied by current and possible future G10 bank regulation, and on the economic solvency standard that banks choose themselves by their own capital-setting decisions. In particular, a credit risk model is employed to show that the survival probability implied by the 1988 Basel Accord is between 99.0% and 99.9%. It is then demonstrated that if a new Basel Accord were calibrated to such a standard, it would not represent a binding constraint on banks' current operations, since most banks employ a solvency standard significantly higher than 99.9%. To show this, a statistical analysis of bank ratings is employed, adjusted for the impact of official or other support, as well as credit risk model calculations. Lastly, a possible explanation is advanced for the conservative capital choices made by banks, by showing that swap volumes are highly correlated with credit quality for given bank size. This suggests that banks' access to important credit markets like the swap markets may provide a significant discipline in the choice of solvency standard."

This compares with a consistently calculated annual figure of 12.5%. In addition, an array of evidence is presented to show that UK gross flows appear to follow a cyclical pattern similar to those found in other countries. Evidence is also presented on the potential problems that previous research may suffer from with their use of recall data to determine prior labour market status.

It is argued that even under relatively cautious assumptions about technological progress and capital accumulation, aggregate living standards (as measured by GDP per head) are set to double over the next 50 years. While there are clear risks to this aggregate outlook, these would be present even without demographic change. The risks to the living standards of individuals and individual cohorts are also discussed. These risks have changed in three main ways as a result of demographic change. First, ageing has been a factor throughout the world in encouraging a shift from public to private provision for old age, increasing the proportion of retired people exposed to risks to market prices and rates of return. Second, the size of the group exposed to such risks is growing larger as a direct result of ageing. Third, any adverse effects of demographic change are most likely to be felt in old age; one of the effects of people living longer is that they have to spread their lifetime incomes over more years of life, implying a need for more saving when working. If this does not occur, then consumption has to be considerably lower in old age than would have been the case had proper provision been made for retirement."

 """,2002.,Equilibrium exchange rates and supply-side performance,"156, Bank of England.","A two-country, optimising, sticky price model of real exchange rate determination in the new open macroeconomics tradition is developed, allowing several different forms of deviation from purchasing power parity (PPP), both along the adjustment path and in the steady state. The model has a rich structure, and is designed to provide a flexible tool for policy analysis. Unlike much of the literature, both of the key components of the real exchange rate-the relative price of non-tradables, and the terms of trade-are made endogenous, allowing a more complete analysis of the impact of structural shocks. To illustrate one possible application, the model is calibrated to match key elements of the UK and euro-area economies, and used to examine the extent to which possible improvements in the United Kingdom's relative supply-side performance might account for the sharp and persistent appreciation in sterling since 1996. The results are not supportive of this hypothesis. In the model, improvements in productivity, goods market and labour market competitiveness are all associated with a depreciation in both the spot and the equilibrium real sterling exchange rates. Two potential supply-side sources of an equilibrium appreciation are considered: a productivity improvement biased towards traded goods (Balassa-Samuelson effect); and an anticipated future productivity rise. However, each is insufficient to account for a long-run equilibrium appreciation, although the latter may account for an initial appreciation of the real exchange rate. The paper is concluded by considering further mechanisms that could affect the results."

Alternative hypotheses are examined with the aid of a New Keynesian model of aggregate demand and inflation determination, estimated on quarterly UK data for 1959-2000. The model features IS and Phillips curves based on optimising behaviour, and fully incorporates the distinction between detrended output and the output gap stressed by optimising analysis. Using model simulations as well as information on the real-time views of policy-makers, alternative explanations are tested for the outbreak of inflation in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s. Inaccurate estimates of the degree of excess demand in the economy are found to have contributed significantly to the outbreak. But there is also evidence of a major role following from the failure at the time to recognise the importance of monetary policy, as opposed to non-monetary devices, in controlling inflation."

 """,2002.,Do changes in structural factors explain movements in the equilibrium rate of unemployment?,"153, Bank of England.","This paper examines the role played by various structural economic changes in explaining movements in the equilibrium rate of unemployment. The theoretical framework developed by Layard, Nickell and Jackman (LNJ) is employed to explain changes in the equilibrium unemployment rate. In the LNJ framework, equilibrium unemployment is determined by the interaction of the price and wage-setting behaviour of firms and workers. The natural rate is a function of structural variables such as the replacement ratio and union power that affect the size of firms and workers mark-ups. A wide range of equations with different combinations of structural variables is examined. It proves extremely difficult to find robust coefficient estimates that are statistically significant and have the expected signs on structural variables, unless a trended variable such as the owner-occupied housing rate is included. However, it is likely that these variables are simply capturing the upward trend in actual unemployment over most of the sample period in response to exogenous shocks. These results are found to be robust over different sample periods and different equation specifications. Therefore the results indicate that it is not possible accurately to explain movements in the natural rate using this approach, supporting the findings of other recent studies that suggest focusing on alternative, less structural, methods for estimating the equilibrium unemployment rate."

These are a subset of a wider range of costs caused by inflation. The paper tests whether or not money balances tend to a finite number as nominal interest rates tend to zero, and investigates how sensitive to this test are the welfare implications of rates of inflation above the Friedman rule (a zero nominal interest rate). The paper then explores how uncertainties about the shape of the money demand curve translate into uncertainties about these welfare costs of inflation. A key uncertainty is the existence of a satiation point for money balances. Using Monte Carlo tests, it is shown that without observations at nominal interest rates very close to zero, the power of satiation tests can be very low. This finding may also be important for evaluating whether/how monetary policy could stabilise the economy in the event of a shock large enough to require that nominal interest rates are driven close to zero."

On the other hand, its main open-economy alternative, Ball's rule based on a monetary conditions index (MCI), may perform poorly in the face of specific types of exchange rate shocks, and thus cannot offer guidance for the day-to-day conduct of monetary policy. In this paper, a comprehensive set of simple monetary policy rules (including the MCI-based and Taylor versions) is specified and evaluated, all suitable for small open economies in general, and for the United Kingdom in particular. The asymptotic properties of a two-sector open-economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model calibrated on UK data are compared under the different rules. It is found that an inflation-forecast-based rule (IFB), ie, one that reacts to deviations of expected inflation from target, performs well. Adding a separate response to the level of the real exchange rate (contemporaneous and lagged) appears to reduce the difference in adjustment between output gaps in the two sectors of the economy, but the improvement is only marginal. Importantly, an IFB rule, with or without exchange rate adjustment, appears robust to different shocks, in contrast to naive or Ball's MCI-based rules."

For the United Kingdom, no official output gap series exists, but an approximate series can be deduced from analysis of statistical releases and policy-makers' statements. On this basis, a real-time UK output gap series is constructed, beginning in 1965, and it is therefore possible to obtain estimates of the extent of real-time output gap mismeasurement in the 1970s and 1980s. Monetary policy errors due to output gap mismeasurement are found to have contributed approximately 3.0 to 7.1 percentage points to average UK inflation in the 1970s and 0.7 to 5.5 percentage points to inflation in the 1980s."

These financial variables can account for most of the increase in omissions since 1995.

The debt-to-GDP ratio, the real interest rate, deviations of GDP from trend and real wages are found to be long-run determinants of the liquidation rate. The birth rate of new companies, an index of property prices and nominal interest rates have significant short-term effects. The estimated equation is robust to changes in the sample period. The rapidly increasing level of indebtedness in the late 1980s was the main determinant of the subsequent increase in the liquidation rate. The decrease in the liquidation rate after 1992 was primarily due to lower real interest rates, lower real wages and the cyclical recovery of GDP."

Any assessment of changes in the skill balance is complicated by the fact that different indicators often send conflicting messages. Such conflicts could reflect the underlying definitions of skilled and unskilled workers, as well as differences in the sensitivities of each measure to alternative market shocks. Our analysis casts doubt on the reliability of standard measures of unemployment dispersion across educational groups, and the Confederation of British Industry ratio of skilled and unskilled labour shortages, as measures of skill imbalance. The gap between the demand for, and the supply of, educated labour has in fact increased steadily over the past two decades, particularly for those workers with graduate-level qualifications. So the apparent decline in the NAIRU over the recent cyclical upswing cannot be attributed to an improvement in the relative ease with which firms can hire educated workers."

Firstly, the direct resolution costs to the government are considered, and then the broader costs to the welfare of the economy (proxied by losses in GDP). The cumulative output losses incurred during crisis periods are found to be large, roughly 15%-20% of annual GDP, on average. In contrast to previous research, it is also found that output losses incurred during crises in developed countries are as high, or higher, on average, than those in emerging market economies. Moreover, output losses during crisis periods in developed countries also appear to be significantly larger - 10%-15% - than in neighbouring countries that did not at the time experience severe banking problems. In emerging market economies, by contrast, banking crises appear to be costly only when accompanied by a currency crisis. These results seem robust to allowing for macroeconomic conditions at the outset of crisis - in particular low and declining output growth - that have also contributed to future output losses during episodes."

First, it is shown that: (a) depending on the stochastic properties of the filtered process, the band-pass filtered cyclical component is entirely authentic, partly or mostly spurious, or even entirely spurious; and (b) as a simple consequence of the Lucas critique, the degree of authenticity of band-pass filtered cyclical components crucially depends on the monetary rule followed by the policy-maker. Second, taking a number of macroeconomic models as data-generation processes it is shown that band-pass filtering: (a) may markedly distort key business cycle stylised facts, as captured by the cross-correlations and the cross-spectral statistics between the cyclical components of the variables of interest and the cyclical component of GDP; and (b) may well create entirely spurious stylised facts. For example: both productivity and the money supply may appear procyclical even when they follow random walks by construction; the real wage may appear procyclical when in fact it is countercyclical; in general, the Phillips correlation between inflation and the cyclical component of economic activity will appear weaker than it is in reality. Again, the degree of authenticity of business cycle stylised facts uncovered via band-pass filtering crucially depends on the monetary rule followed by the policy-maker."

The source of the fallacy is an elementary economic misspecification. The FTPL denies a fundamental property of any model of a market economy, that the budget constraint of any agent, private or public, must be satisfied identically, ie for all admissible values of the variables entering the budget constraint. Instead the FTPL requires the government's inter-temporal budget constraint to be satisfied only in equilibrium. The FTPL looks for equilibria in which the government can meet its contractual debt obligations exactly, despite having an overdetermined financial-fiscal monetary programme. The economic misspecification has implications for the mathematical properties of the equilibria supported by models that impose the structure of the FTPL. For example, the FTPL implies the anomaly that it can price money in an economy without money. The FTPL has an exact analogue in a 'household budget constraint theory of the price level', which is perhaps more readily recognised as a nonsense."

Perhaps not surprisingly, a number of measures of bank weakness - low loan growth, poor profitability and illiquidity - are found to be good short-term predictors of failure, as are a high dependence on net interest income and low leverage.

The second establishes a relationship between real exchange rates and real interest rate differentials. The tests are conducted on a panel of 18 OECD economies using the United States as a numeraire for the post-Bretton Woods era. The results are obtained using new non-stationary panel estimation techniques, which significantly increase the power of the tests. All the tests suggest that there is little evidence supporting PPP when it is tested directly. This contrasts with earlier panel data studies, which tended to find that the real exchange rate was stationary. The results supporting a long-run relationship between real exchange rates and real interest rate differentials appear to be more positive. This again provides a contrast with earlier results, which tended to find no evidence of cointegration. Such studies concentrated on G7 economies. To investigate this further the panel was split into two groups: the G7 and eleven small open economies. For the panel of small open economies strong evidence in favour of cointegration is found. In contrast, there is no evidence of cointegration in a panel that consists purely of the G7 economies."

In sample, it is possible to track all three of the target variables with equity returns. But the out-of-sample results are poor. Although some ETPs retain significant explanatory power, most do not, and in all cases there is a substantial deterioration in the relationship between the ETPs and the target variables.

This paper investigates the properties of monetary regimes that combine price level and inflation targeting.

Asymptotic variances are derived of the price level, inflation and output associated with each of these regimes when the economy is modelled as a small-scale open-economy RE model calibrated on UK data. The conclusions are that: (i) the relative merits of price level and inflation targeting, as well as of mixes of these two, are a function of several modelling and policy assumptions; and (ii) these merits do not change monotonically in the move from one regime to another. It appears also that the probability of nominal interest rates hitting a 'zero bound' under the alternative regimes is model-specific and varies non-monotonically among them."

The model is used to quantify the contribution to long-run growth of technological progress that is specific to the ICT sector. It is found that technological progress that is specific to the ICT sector might account for around 20%-30% of long-run labour productivity growth. But this conclusion depends crucially on how ICT prices are measured. It is shown that shocks to technological progress that is specific to production of ICT investment goods can have very different macroeconomic implications from a shock that applies to production of all goods. It is demonstrated that a permanent increase in the growth rate of ICT-specific technological progress will increase the investment expenditure share of GDP but lower the aggregate depreciation rate, while an increase in the return to investment in ICT will increase both the expenditure share and the depreciation rate."

The competitive forces that act to compete away abnormal returns need not act symmetrically and may differ at different points in the distribution of profitability. This suggestion is tested empirically on an unbalanced panel of 2,129 companies. First, evidence for both asymmetries and non-linearities in the persistence of company profitability is found. The results are consistent with the notion that competitive forces act less swiftly to eliminate superior returns than inferior returns and/or that companies attempts to allocate a positive result to more years than they would allocate a poor result. Second, by imposing a linear specification, previous studies are likely to have understated the extent of persistence of superior profitability. Third, industry variation in the extent of profit persistence is considered. Under the standard linear model such variation across industries is quite small. A greater degree of variation between industries is found when allowing for persistence in a non-linear fashion.

 """,2000.,Age structure and the UK unemployment rate,"124, Bank of England.","The proportion of youths in the labour force has fallen dramatically over the past 15 years, following the collapse in the fertility rate in the 1970s ('the baby bust'). Given that youths always have higher unemployment rates than adults, this shift in the composition of the labour force towards those with lower unemployment rates may have been responsible for a fall in the aggregate unemployment rate. Using data from the Labour Force Survey, it is estimated that about 55 basis points of the 565 basis point fall in the UK unemployment rate between 1984 and 1998 can be accounted for by changes in the age structure of the labour force. Changes in the fraction of each age group that is economically active will also affect the composition of the labour force (and therefore potentially the unemployment rate); however, even controlling for changing labour force participation rates by age, demographically driven shifts in the age composition of the labour force still explain about 40 basis points of the fall in the unemployment rate. Finally, it is estimated that demographic change will have a negligible impact on the unemployment rate over the next decade, on the basis of recent labour force projections."

An associated concern is that the linkages between these markets become stronger in times of financial market stress.

The standard optimising IS-LM model cannot account for this result, but it is shown that it can once the long-term nominal interest rate is included in the money demand function. Because the long-term real rate matters for aggregate demand, the presence of the long-term nominal rate in the money demand function increases the effect of nominal money stock changes on real aggregate demand when prices are sticky."

However, subject to this caveat, the model is able to reproduce the stylised fact that there is little relationship between monetary aggregates and either output or inflation, even though the underlying cause of inflation is money growth. The money-income and money-inflation relationships vary substantially within the model depending on what type of shock is hitting the economy, a strong argument for using structural models of the monetary transmission mechanism in which shocks are identified. The model is also able to capture important features of the monetary transmission mechanism in the United Kingdom, as embodied in the responses of variables to monetary policy shocks."

This paper begins to address these questions by examining the absolute and relative robustness of two of the most common methods for estimating implied PDFs - the double-lognormal approximating function and the smoothed implied volatility smile methods. The changes resulting from randomly perturbing quoted prices by no more than a half tick provide a lower bound on the confidence intervals of the summary statistics derived from the estimated PDFs. Tests are conducted using options contracts tied to short sterling futures and the FTSE 100 index - both trading on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. The tests show that the smoothed implied volatility smile method dominates the double-lognormal as a technique for estimating implied PDFs when average goodness-of-fits for both methods are comparable."

A small system is estimated containing eight variables that theoretically have an important role in the transmission mechanism. The paper then attempts to decompose the movements of each of these variables into a small number of independent underlying forcing processes or 'shocks', with a well-defined economic interpretation. In addition to identifying shocks to productivity, domestic demand, external demand and the foreign exchange risk premium, the paper distinguishes between several types of monetary shock. In particular, a distinction is made between 'permanent' monetary policy shocks, attributable to changes in the underlying nominal target of the authorities, and 'temporary' policy shocks, reflecting either policy 'errors' or transitory deviations from the authorities' reaction function. A financial intermediation shock is also identified reflecting changes in the provision of credit by the banking system and the degree of financial liberalisation.

Financially constrained firms are identified using a number of criteria, including the criterion suggested by Bond and Meghir (1994) based on the firm's financial policy. The main finding is that the effect of cash flow on inventory investment is concentrated among firms identified as financially constrained using either their financial policy or a criterion based on their current ratio. This suggests that there is no unique criterion for identifying financially constrained firms using financial information in company accounts. Contrary to what previous studies have found, using firm size or the coverage ratio to define financially constrained firms does not reduce the effect of cash flow on the inventory investment of unconstrained firms. This raises doubts about whether these are accurate indicators of whether a firm is financially constrained. Combined with Bond and Meghir's similar findings for fixed investment, the results in this paper suggest that cash flow effects form part of the monetary transmission mechanism."

A necessary condition for this is that the short nominal interest rate is constrained by its lower bound, typically zero. The paper develops a small analytical model to show how an economy can get into a liquidity trap, how it can avoid getting into one and how it can get out. The empirical likelihood of the UK economy hitting the zero nominal rate bound is considered by investigating the relationship between the level of the short nominal interest rate and its volatility. The empirical evidence on this issue is mixed. To reduce the risk of falling into a liquidity trap, the authorities have two options. The first is to raise the inflation target. The second is to lower the zero nominal interest rate floor. This second option involves paying negative interest on government 'bearer bonds' - coin and currency - ie 'taxing money', as advocated by Gesell. Once in a liquidity trap, there are two means of escape. The first is to use expansionary fiscal policy. The second is, again, to lower the zero nominal interest rate floor.

This conclusion is often applied to the advanced industrial economies, where resources are indeed shifting towards the relatively stagnant service industries.

This is important empirically, since the most rapidly expanding service industries are those such as financial and business services, which are large producers of intermediate products.

News about policy preferences shows up in movements at the long end of the yield curve and is a signal of imperfect monetary policy credibility. The paper considers empirical case studies of the response of the yield curve in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Italy at the time of monetary policy changes. It finds that the introduction of inflation targeting in the United Kingdom has had a significantly dampening effect on yield curve surprises at the short end.

The paper looks at how parameter uncertainty in the transmission mechanism affects the optimal nominal and real interest rate relative to the case when the parameters are known. Its chief contribution is to show that three consequences are identified: conservatism (smaller deviations of real and nominal interest rates from some neutral level in response to inflationary shocks), gradualism (increased autocorrelation in real and nominal interest rates) and caution (a smaller cumulative policy response). The paper examines the sensitivity of these effects to different specifications of the transmission mechanism; in particular the introduction of an exchange rate channel.

Using the statistical technique of discriminant analysis, sectors were sorted into groups on the basis of their measured values of openness in 1970.

There was a positive correlation between the growth in labour productivity and lagged values of each of the observed measures of openness.

Gap estimates are constructed by summing the effects of particular structural shocks, where the shocks are identified using long-run restrictions derived from theory. The approach has four main advantages over other methods. First, it uses economics rather than statistics to construct the gaps. Second, the estimates are not contingent upon particular assumptions about the structure of the economy. Third, it does not impose a rigid causal chain running from gaps to inflation. Fourth, it permits the simultaneous construction of several gap measures and the examination of their relationship with inflation in a single framework, so that the three gap measures are internally consistent and can be used to make inferences about the structure of the economy."

Any conclusions, in this respect, are likely to be sensitive to model specification. However, the paper goes on to identify a second-best issue concerning the optimal make-up of the union which is likely to be more robust: namely that only when all members of the union have the same structural parameter values, and shocks are perfectly correlated, will it be optimal for a new member to have these same structural parameter values."

These rules are compared with the estimated interest rate equation from the VAR.

We follow Clarida and Gali (1994) in using the Blanchard and Quah (1989) structural VAR (SVAR) method to identify the effects of three structural shocks within a Dornbusch (1976)/Obstfeld (1995) model. We find that IS shocks underlay the majority of the variance of sterling real and nominal exchange rates. Aggregate supply (AS) shocks were the second most important source of such variations, while LM shocks played an extremely limited role. In contrast, the variance of UK relative consumer prices was primarily attributed to LM shocks. Combining those results with the estimated impulse response functions indicates that the sterling exchange rate depreciations over the floating rate period were largely associated with falls in UK relative consumer prices. But it would be inappropriate for policy-makers to base any future policy response to sterling fluctuations on that finding because: (a) the Lucas critique applies to it; and (b) it represents the average dynamic interaction over the sample period. We also find that: (i) the estimated impulse responses following each of the shocks are highly theory-consistent; and (ii) the periods in which the SVARs suggest that particular shocks were especially important can be linked to observed macroeconomic developments. both those findings indicate that the SVAR representations of the data have a high economic content."

The existence of a long-run cointegrating relationship between M0 and key economic variables is established and a plausible dynamic error-correction model is estimated. A model that passes standard specification tests is achieved without resort to arbitrary proxies for financial innovation. Some of the recent decline in M0 velocity is explained by the move to a lower inflation environment.

It is an issue that is relevant to the choice of the level of the inflation target, as it has been argued that targeting too low a level of inflation will be harmful when downward rigidities exist. The existence of such rigidities is questioned from a theoretical perspective on the basis of the very strict conditions that would have to apply. Also it is argued that concern for 'fairness' or the presence of 'money illusion' do not in themselves justify positive inflation. Empirical evidence is investigated and it is found that the existence of downward rigidities is not proven."

The paper investigates the relationship more formally, within a theoretical model of productivity catch-up. The model identifies three potential effects of international openness: openness may affect (a) domestic rates of innovation, (b) the quantity of technological know-how that may be transferred from the frontier to the less advanced economy, (c) the rate at which this technology transfer occurs. From the theoretical framework, an econometric equation is derived which is used to estimate the relationship between UK productivity growth, the UK-US productivity gap and the degree of international openness. International openness is found, primarily, to affect the rate of productivity convergence, and this relationship is robust to the inclusion of information on R&D intensity, human capital, unionisation and capacity utilisation."

In an attempt to reconcile the conflicting results of earlier studies this paper evalutes the relative liquidity and price discovery roles of these two markets using data from 1995 Q2. The paper finds that this conflict is largely a product of the price data used. Using both transactions prices and quotes data (on a minute by minute basis), variable transaction costs, i.e. spreads, are found to be similar on both markets. There is some evidence to suggest that the order processing component of the spread is larger on LIFFE, but that the compensation required for adverse selection risk is greater on the DTB. Also, the contribution to price formation of each market is found to be similar; there is no clear leader/follower relationship. The main differences between the two markets are the larger trade size on the open outcry market and a tendency for trading to move toward the open outcry market during volatile periods."

The inflation forecasts of the ITS also seem at least as good at forecasting future changes in inflation as forecasts derived from macroeconometric models. These characteristics of the ITS and its timeliness tend to make its inflation forecasts a useful addition to policy analysis. Because the real term structure tends to underpredict the level of future real interest rates, index-linked bonds have proved, ex post, to be cheap funding for the UK government.

There is substantial heterogeneity (both across sectors and time) in rates of growth of value-added, hours worked, labour productivity and Total Factor Productivity during the sample period. The decline in constant price value-added in aggregate manufacturing during the sample period is associated with significant changes in the relative size of individual sectors, and with noticeable changes in performance between the two peak-to-peak business cycles 1973-79 and 1979-89. Despite changes in the relative size of sectors, the vast majority of aggregate productivity growth is explained by within-sector productivity growth. An analysis of productivity levels also reveals considerable heterogeneity. The distribution of productivity levels across sectors exhibits an increase in dispersion and becomes increasingly positively skewed during the sample period. There is evidence of productivity levels in a number of industries converging at values just below the mean; productivity levels in a few sectors persistently remain above and rise away from mean values."

First, the estimated average mark-ups and the profit margin results both suggest that there is imperfect competition in manufacturing and services. Second, mark-ups are pro-cyclical, as are profit margins even after allowing for movements in their standard determinants. This suggests that price pressures may increase during recovery periods and decrease during recessions. One possible explanation for this is Kreps and Scheinkman's argument that the pro-cyclicality of capacity constraints means that firms move between Cournot and Bertrand competition over the cycle. The finding that mark-ups are pro- cyclical also raises doubts about macroeconomic models that assume that demand shocks may affect employment via counter-cyclical mark-ups."

The paper documents considerable heterogeneity across contracts, and finds that contract success can not easily be inferred from the contract's first years of trading. As expected, contract success is highly correlated with the size of the underlying market, as well as with its volatility. The paper also confirms the existence of a first-mover advantage. There is little systematic correlation, however, between bid-ask spreads and futures volume. This suggests that there may be a critical level of trading activity beyond which bid-ask spreads and execution risk vary relatively little. It is further argued that liquidity seems less a cause of contract success (or lack of liquidity a cause of failure), but rather a consequence. These results may provide a useful perspective as exchanges prepare themselves for the planned monetary unification. Successful product innovation will be critical since exchanges may face a drop in demand with reduced monetary uncertainty, and a reduction of the current spectrum of interest rate contracts to Euro contracts only. A related question is whether a futures markets needs a well developed spot market to succeed, or whether the creation of a futures market could help to boost liquidity in a fledgling spot market."

 """,1997.,Agency Incentives and Reputational Distortions: a Comparison of the Effectiveness of Value-at-Risk and Pre-commitment in Regulating Market Risk,"69, Bank of England.","In regulating the market risk exposure of banks, the approach taken to date is (in either the Standard or the Value-at-Risk methodology) to use a 'hard-link' regime that sets a fixed relation between exposure and capital requirement exogenously. A new 'Pre-commitment' approach (PCA) proposes the use of a 'soft-link'. Such a link is not externally imposed, but arises endogenously. In other words, it relies on the interaction between the bank owner and managers which is based on the preferences of both parties and the compensation scheme offered to the managers. Such an approach is of much greater economic appeal, as it is incentive-based and so less prescriptive. But, this paper argues that there is a trade off. The use of incentives by the new approach implies that a whole host of strategic interactions in the bank are relevant in evaluating its effectiveness. This aspect of a soft-link regulation such as PCA seems to have received little attention. We attempt to clarify the precise nature of the trade-off by analysing two potential sources of distortion: agency and reputational. In the context of a simple principle-agent model, the paper studies incentives generated by PCA on managerial risk-taking when the level of risk is not directly contractable. We identify contexts in which a distortion might arise. Second, it studies the effect of reputational concerns under public disclosure of a breach. The paper shows that this might lead to a perverse pattern in the relative size of the trading activities compared with the size of bank as a whole. A hard-link approach avoids such distortions. The results form a first step towards modifying PCA to construct optimal incentive-compatible regulatory schemes. How PCA might be modified to rectify the distortions identified here, is discussed informally."

 """,1997.,The Industrial Impact of Monetary Policy Shocks: Some Stylised Facts,"68, Bank of England.","This paper investigates the disaggregated effects of monetary policy shocks on the output of 24 sectors of the UK economy. The paper's principal aim is to provide stylised facts about the sectoral responses to unexpected changes in monetary policy and to help assess how monetary policy developments feed through the economy. It also provides indirect evidence about the underlying nature of the transmission mechanism. The first set of results relates to the largest industrial sectors - construction, services, production industries (including utilities and manufacturing) - which sum together to form the output measure of GDP. Thereafter the paper focuses on the manufacturing sector alone. Data sources for manufacturing are richer than for other sectors of the economy, which allows a more detailed analysis of the factors that might account for the pattern of responses to monetary shocks which we observe across manufacturing. Focusing first on the main industrial sectors, the paper finds that the effects of an unanticipated monetary policy tightening seem to be unevenly distributed across sectors of the economy. As might be expected, sectors such as construction show a sizeable and rapid decline in output, whereas others, like services, show a much more muted reaction. Manufacturing as a whole also responds quite sharply to a monetary tightening, but some large industrial sectors, notably the utilities, show a subdued reaction. Turning finally to the manufacturing sector alone, the paper shows that the (2 digit SIC) sectors that comprise manufacturing also exhibit diverse responses to a monetary shock. The paper shows the pattern of manufacturing sector responses seems correlated with the size characteristics of the firms in each sector. In particular, sectors which mainly comprise ""small"" firms tend to exhibit a stronger reaction to monetary shocks than sectors that mainly comprise ""larger"" firms. This might indicate that credit market imperfections play a role in the monetary policy transmission process."

It elaborates on an article in the May 1996 Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin. In the year preceding the survey, the average company reviewed its prices once a month. The extent and source of price rigidity varied across different types of company and market. Retailers reviewed and changed their prices more frequently than manufacturers. Companies operating in more competitive markets reviewed prices more often than companies with few direct competitors; but long-term relationships with customers appeared to reduce price flexibility. Despite the frequency of reviews, actual prices were only changed twice on average, indicating that there may be substantial costs of changing prices. Companies stated that the need to preserve customer relationships (due to explicit or implicit contractual arrangements) or to maintain market share were important sources of price rigidity. In addition, the overwhelming majority of companies indicated that they would be more likely to increase overtime and capacity than change their price in response to a boom in demand. There were substantial asymmetries in the factors which drive prices up and those that push prices down. Time-dependent pricing rules appeared to be much more widespread than state-dependent pricing rules, suggesting that the short-run real effects of monetary policy could increase at lower rates of inflation. Overall, the survey results indicate that UK markets do not behave as if prices are costlessly and instantaneously determined. It appears that uncertainty about the extent or permanence of changes in market conditions combined with costs of adjusting prices means that many companies' short-run response to a change in demand is to adjust output rather than price. Taking account of such behaviour could be important in explaining the short-run real effects of monetary policy."

For example, a futures price gives a widely used measure of the market's views about the future value of an asset, namely its mean or expected value at the maturity date of the futures contract. Moreover, the information available from futures prices can be extended by using option prices to estimate the market's entire probability distribution of the future value of an asset. This paper develops various techniques for estimating the market's probability distribution of the future value of an underlying asset from the prices of options on that asset. It discusses the relative merits and drawbacks of each approach, and shows how our preferred approach can be applied to estimate ex ante probability distributions using LIFFE equity and interest rate options, and Philadelphia Stock Exchange currency options. The paper then illustrates the potential value of this type of information to the policy-maker in assessing monetary conditions and conducting monetary operations. Finally, the paper looks at the limitations in data availability and highlights some areas for future research."

Two sets of real interest rates are considered: European short maturity rates and G3 long maturity rates. The analysis of European short rates reveals statistical evidence that the German real interest rate is the single dominant common trend and that the two common cycles are represented by the spreads of French and UK rates over German rates. The single common trend remains when the United States is added, but German leadership is then rejected in favour of US leadership. In the G3 long rate system, a single common trend appears to exist only after 1980."

The analysis is motivated by a simple theoretical model of endogenous economic growth, in which patterns of comparative advantage are determined by the history of technological change and help determine current rates of innovation. Learning by doing that is specific to a manufacturing sector provides a reason why initial patterns of comparative advantage and international specialisation will persist over time. In contrast, spillovers of technological knowledge between economies are a source of mobility in patterns of international specialisation. We present an empirical measure of the degree of specialisation in exports of a given sector termed Revealed Comparative Advantage. The distribution of this measure across sectors provides information on international specialisation at a point in time. Analysing how the distribution evolves over time yields insights into changes in international specialisation. By explicitly modelling the dynamics of Revealed Comparative Advantage across sectors and over time, the degree of persistence and mobility in actual patterns of international trade is evaluated. The degree of mobility over the sample period is found to be surprisingly high, with the pattern of international specialisation in the United Kingdom more mobile than that in Germany."

A three-equation model of money, investment and the cost of capital is estimated, and the results suggest the existence of a corporate sector liquidity channel whereby firms' ""excess"" money balances have a negative influence on the cost of capital and a positive impact on investment spending. OFIs' money holdings are shown to depend upon wealth and relative rates of return, in line with standard portfolio models of money demand.

This paper is the first part of a follow-up study to Fisher and Vega in 1993, examining the determinants of personal sector holdings of M4 in the UK and the role they play in the transmission mechanism. A joint-model of personal sector M4 and consumption is developed which offers some useful insights into the role of money in the economy. In the long run both money and consumption are found to be related to income, wealth and interest rates, the estimated relationships being fairly standard theoretical specifications. But the model also reveals that money and consumption interact strongly in the short run, the nature of the interaction depending on the type of disturbance that has occurred. Positive disturbances to consumption initially lead to a fall in money balances, so that there is a negative relationship between money and consumption in the short-run. This is consistent with money's role as a ""buffer-stock"" which absorbs short-term fluctuations in spending. Positive disturbances to money, on the other hand, lead to a rise in consumption in the first instance, so that the short-run relationship is positive. This would be consistent with a number of possible liquidity and credit effects on consumption. These different relationships have important implications for interpreting movements in personal sector money holdings. Faster money growth may be consistent with a number of different underlying disturbances, each requiring its own policy response."

Using an extended stochastic growth model the authors construct estimates of productivity and preference shocks both of which are highly persistent, volatile and potentially capable of explaining UK business cycles. They find the productivity term is the dominant explanation of UK output fluctuations but that changes in underlying preferences are crucial in understanding employment movements. Holland and Scott use a variety of Granger causality tests to establish whether these productivity and preference terms are predictable and so can be potentially considered as the cause of UK business cycles or whether they are themselves Granger caused by other variables. They find that their estimated productivity term is not predicted by any demand-side variable including various fiscal and monetary policy instruments, but is to a limited extent by oil prices and the share of taxes in GDP. This suggests that their ""productivity"" shock may also reflect other supply- side influences. In contrast they find their ""preference"" shift is predicted to a substantial extent by real variables, such as the terms of trade and oil prices, and nominal variables, such as the money supply and the price level. The implications of these findings for competing theories of the business cycles and for the monetary transmission mechanism are discussed."

It is also unusual in that it trades on competing Exchanges - LIFFE in London and the DTB in Frankfurt. This paper looks at a surprising aspect of this dually traded contract, namely that the contract trades slightly more expensively (1.5 basis points) in LIFFE than in the DTB. LIFFE argue that this price difference helps make their contract more attractive. The paper investigates three possible explanations for the price difference. First, the calculation of price factors (conversion factors that make bonds in the basket of deliverables more comparable) differs slightly between Exchanges. Second, the DTB contract carries on trading for one day longer than the LIFFE one giving the short one more days to choose which bund in the basket to deliver (the so-called quality option) and so makes the contract slightly less valuable to the trader with a long position. Third, the penalty for late delivery is harsher on LIFFE than on the DTB and so investors fearing a short squeeze (where investors that are supposed to deliver the underlying bunds cannot acquire them) will be more nervous of holding a LIFFE contract than a DTB one. It concludes that none of these factors are important enough to explain the observed price difference and so it is hard to explain why the price difference occurs."

Although previous work in the Bank has estimated yield curves from gilt prices and found that these give useful information about long-term expectations, the value of such yield curves at short horizons - below two years - is open to question. This paper analyses two related questions on short-term interest rate expectations: 1) is there useful information in shorter-term interest rates and 2) are some interest rates more informative than others? In particular, it compares the relative performance of the short end of the Bank yield curve and traded LIMEAN rates at various maturities. Its benchmark of comparison is a practical one - it assesses, ex post, how well the different measures predicted future shorter-term interest rates (eg how well six-month interest rates predict three-month interest rates in three months time). It finds that the yield curve contains some information at short horizons but that it is less reliable than the information from LIMEAN rates. This suggests that the current Bank approach of only analysing yield curves above two-year horizons and using other information to measure short-term interest rate expectations is probably correct. Although interest rate futures are a widely used measure of market expectations the information they contain is not directly comparable to the yield curve."

This paper looks at the issue of accountability in a simple theoretical model. Defining greater accountability as lower public uncertainty over the Central Bank's preferences, it shows that greater accountability will tend to be associated with improved inflation performance. This follows because, increased uncertainty will cause the public to raise their average inflation expectation, ceteris paribus. This can be thought of as a form of risk premium that the public add to their inflation expectations when they are uncertain about the Central Bank's future actions. Given this result, the paper goes on to establish that a given level of inflation can be achieved by different combinations of accountability and independence. Greater accountability means that the same inflation outcome can be achieved at lower independence. The paper then suggests that this result accounts for the negative correlation between independence and accountability found in Briault, Haldane and King."

Walsh (1995) proposed a way round this - for the government to delegate monetary policy to an independent central bank working under a contract defined in terms of inflation. Walsh argued that the inflation bias in policy could be eliminated without interfering with the government's ability to stabilise output when it needed to. This paper criticises Walsh's result showing that if there are political pressures on the real interest rates then the inflation bias might vary from period to period. The paper argues that it is not practical to write contracts for every period, so good contracts will interfere with stabilisation policy. Such a contract may be no better than other means of preserving credibility, like, for example, the ERM. The paper discusses how close Walsh's contract is to the practice of inflation targeting; arguing that there is some, but by no means a complete, read-across from one to the other. This paper also suggests that Walsh's solution to the credibility problem is not a solution at all. There is no obvious way that government can be made to enforce the contract, other than that they may be concerned about their reputations. In this respect, regimes like the ERM are more effective, since it is possible for those who stay in - at least in principle - to penalise those who renege by withdrawing associated benefits of membership."

It finds that the volatility of all these assets is on a declining trend after peaking in the late '70s. It seems that greater nominal and real macroeconomic stability are the most likely causes of the current declining trend. Volatility is, however, still significantly higher than in the Bretton Woods era. The authors find no evidence that asset price volatility has any consequences for real activity."

 """,1996.,Unemployment persistence: Does the size of the shock matter?,"50, Bank of England.","One of the stylized facts of unemployment is that shifts in its mean rate between decades and half-decades account for most of its variance. In this paper, the authors use a statistical analysis based on switching regression models and nonparametric density estimation techniques to identify the dates of infrequent changes in the mean of the unemployment rate series of 17 countries. They find that in most countries, unemployment persistence is small once the (infrequently) changing mean rate has been removed. The changes in the mean rate coincide with large annual changes in actual unemployment. The conclusion is that the observed persistence in unemployment appears to be consistent with unemployment hysteresis arising after large shocks to unemployment, but not after small changes. The result poses a challenge to theory, since most existing hysteresis models do not have this non-linearity property."

 """,1996.,Independence and Accountability,"49, Bank of England.","Why have central banks become more accountable and transparent in recent years? This paper considers a set of analytical models of monetary policy institutions to shed light on this. One conclusion it reaches is that uncertainty - regarding the central bank's inflation preferences or about the underlying model of the world - can generate inflationary problems which transparency can help counteract. This offers one rationale for the current monetary policy framework in the UK. The paper also constructs a quantitative index of accountability. This suggests that transparency has been pursued most actively by central banks with little independence and a low accrued stock of credibility. Again, this chimes with UK experience.

 """,1996.,The Construction of the Bank's new UK Commodity Price Index,"48, Bank of England.","Indices which represent weighted averages of the prices of 'basic' commodities are often used in analysing inflationary pressures. Because basic commodities are usually purchased for further processing, changes in their prices will affect producers' costs, and these changes may eventually be passed on to consumers. Although there are a variety of such indices to choose from, they tend to reflect world demand for commodities (which is dominated by US demand) and so do not reflect commodity price pressures from a purely UK point of view. This paper presents a commodity price index which attempts to reflect UK commodity price pressures. It differs from other indices in three main ways. First, the weights used are based on UK demand for each commodity. Second, instead of using a sterling equivalent of world prices, the index uses prices actually paid in the UK and so allows for factors such as CAP administered prices. Third, its coverage of fuels is more comprehensive than most indices. This index is already presented in the Inflation Report and an article describing it appeared in the August 1995 Quarterly Bulletin. The purpose of the Working Paper is mainly to outline the method for those who wish to replicate this index."

 """,1996.,Measurement Bias in Price Indices: An Application to the UK's RPI,"47, Bank of England.","The paper assesses the potential for systematic discrepancies between the measured RPI and an 'ideal' cost-of- living which, the paper argues, should be the target variable for monetary policy (note that the RPI does not claim to be a cost-of-living measure and so this discrepancy does not imply that the RPI is wrong). It identifies four main sources of potential bias. First, product substitution bias which is caused by consumers substituting away from relatively expensive items over time (given that the RPI is based on an annually fixed basket of goods it may overestimate the actual increase in the cost-of-living of consumers who actively substitute). Second, Outlet substitution bias which, in a similar way to product substitution bias, is due to consumers moving away from relatively expensive retail outlets. Third, quality adjustment bias which arises when price rises due simply to improved quality of goods are not fully removed from the RPI. Finally, new goods bias which comes about when new goods, whose price tends to fall, are not introduced into the index. Using the results of detailed studies from the US and Canada and combining these with available data in the UK the paper comes up with a 'guesstimate' range of overall bias in the UK of 0.35% to 0.8% percentage points per annum. (i.e. RPI inflation is 0.35% to 0.8% above cost of living inflation). However, this range does not represent the range of possible outcomes it simply reflects the range of results in the North American studies. In practice, there are a number of factors that these studies have not controlled for and so the possible range of the bias could be much wider than the range defined above."

 """,1996.,A Market for Intra-day Funds: Does it Have Implications for Monetary Policy?,"46, Bank of England.","The UK is due to move to a system of real-time gross settlement (RTGS) later this year. Although the decision to move to RTGS was based on prudential concerns, this paper considers whether it has any implications for the implementation of monetary policy. In particular, the move could, in theory, lead to the development of an intra-day funds market which in turn would imply the existence of intra-day interest rates. Although the paper argues that such a market is unlikely to develop in the near term, it continues by developing a simple theoretical framework to analyse the intra-day funds market and the intra-day yield curve. The paper derives two main results from this model. First, intra-day interest rates of a given duration could be highly volatile, even in the absence of shocks, since rates will vary depending on how close to the end of the trading day the loan is taken out. Second, the provision of intra-day liquidity does not effect a central bank's ability to control one-day (or longer) interest rates. As long as intra-day loans have to be repaid at some point during the day, the Bank will retain control over the one-day interest rate. As a result, extending the opening hours of the intra-day market (i.e. the period over which the discount window is open) could help reduce Herstatt risk without unduly influencing monetary control."

This rule targets nominal income using the monetary base as its instrument whilst making an allowance for any on-going changes in money velocity. The paper conducts a range of historical counterfactual simulation exercises to establish the likely impact on the UK economy of using such a rule over the period 1960 to 1994. The paper finds that had the rule been followed over that period a far superior inflationary performance would have resulted. Moreover, this improved performance would not have come about at the expense of heightened output or base money variability. The paper suggests that while such a rule could never substitute a more eclectic approach which uses a wider range of indicators, it could serve as a useful benchmark when assessing whether monetary policy is broadly ""on track""; it is a effectively a dynamic M0 monitoring range. As such, the implied profiles from such a simple rule may help provide insurance against the type of ""big"" policy mistakes which the UK economy has been subject to over the last 25 years."

 """,1996.,International Bank Lending to LDCs - an Information-Based Approach,"43, Bank of England.","This paper presents a theoretical model of international bank lending that may explain ""herd-like"" behaviour in lending to LDCs. The model assumes that there is a central money-centre bank whose behaviour influences that of regional banks by virtue of the fact that the regional bank can observe the money-centre's lending before making a decision itself. Given this leader-follower relationship and the fact that neither bank has complete information about the borrower, the regional bank's lending behaviour will be influenced by the observed level of lending by the money-centre bank (since it infers some of the money-centre bank's banks information from this). However, since the money-centre bank knows that the regional bank is doing this it can manipulate the regional bank's behaviour by its own actions. Solving this model shows that lending is higher than is optimal (i.e. above what would occur under perfect information). Also, since the borrower realises that lending will be higher and related largely to the strategic interaction between two types of lender he need make less adjustment effort than under perfect information. This paper also presents some informed evidence that this herd-like behaviour, excessive lending and insufficient adjustment occurred between 1979 and 1981 in LDC lending."

It compares the prices received at all auctions between May 1987 and February 1995 with both the When-Issued price (the pre- auction market for delivery of the auction stock) and the price of a comparable parent stock (when one existed). The paper finds a marked difference in performance between non-fungible stocks (when a parent exists but the tranche cannot be traded identically with the parent until a few weeks after the auction due to part payments and different first coupons) and fully-fungible stocks (when the parent and tranche trade identically from auction day). The average auction price received for non-fungible stock was significantly below both the When-issued price (about 13p per o100) and the adjusted parent price (about 24p per o100). In the case of fully fungible auctions there was no discernable price difference between auction stock, When-issued, or adjusted parent stock price. Auction prices below comparable secondary market ones is a common result for Government debt auctions (similar results have been found for the US, Germany and Mexico). The explanation usually given is that uncertainty about the correct price leads bidders to shade down their bids. The paper examines this explanation and finds that although it can help explain the results for non- fungible auctions (measures of uncertainty seem to be correlated with the degree of price difference) it does not explain the markedly different results observed for fully-fungible auctions since the dispersion of bids for these auctions is no less than for non-fungible ones suggesting that some uncertainty still exists.

 """,1995.,Optimal Commitment in an Open Economy: Credibility vs. Flexibility,"41, Bank of England.","The theoretical argument for central bank independence is based on the idea that even if the government represents people's preferences over inflation and output it has an incentive to renege from prearranged plans to gain a short run boost to output. This incentive leads to higher than desired inflation. One solution to this credibility problem is to give control of monetary policy to an independent central bank that is more averse to inflation than society. Central bank independence thus reduces society's credibility problem but this may be at the expense of less flexible countercyclical monetary policy. The aim of this paper is to find the correct balance between credibility and flexibility, ie the optimal degree of central bank independence. The first part of the paper sets out an open economy model and identifies some macroeconomic factors that influence the optimal degree of independence. It finds that the optimal degree of independence increases when; 1) the NAIRU is higher, 2) the benefits of unanticipated inflation are greater, 3) society is less inflation-averse, 4) productivity shocks have smaller variance, 5) the real exchange rate has less variability, 6) the economy is less open. The second part of the paper estimates the relationship between these six factors and measures of central bank independence for 19 industrial countries using a latent variables estimation technique. It finds that, in general, the actual degree of independence is related to these six factors and so the institutional arrangements in most countries are close to the optimum. The main exceptions are Germany and Switzerland - that seem to have an excessively high degree of independence - and Australia, Norway, Sweden and the UK - which have a lower than optimal degree of independence."

 """,1995.,Valuation of underwriting agreements for UK rights issues: evidence from the traded option market,"39, Bank of England.","A recent study by Professor Marsh of the London Business School has estimated that sub-underwriters of rights issues (firms that commit to buy up any remaining shares at the end of a rights issue) make an excess profit of 86% of the fee they charge. Because of this study, the OFT (who originally commissioned it) have argued that underwriting is too expensive and have encouraged firms to reconsider their issuance techniques. Marsh's study, however, is based on a number of assumptions that are unlikely to hold in practice. In particular, Marsh used the Black and Scholes option pricing formula to value the economic cost of underwriting (underwriting is like a put option since it gives the firm the right but not the obligation to sell shares to the underwriter). But it is well known that the Black and Scholes formula is based on a high unrealistic view of financial markets with no transactions costs and no information asymmetries. To make a more realistic estimate of the economic cost of underwriting, this paper looks at the cost of buying put options in the traded option market. This does not mean that buying a put option in the traded option market is a viable alternative to underwriting it simply allows for a more realistic measure of transactions costs. By looking at the price of put options on firms who have just announced a rights issue the paper funds, unsurprisingly, that the true cost of put options was much higher than the Black and Scholes formula predicted. However, it still found that underwriters made an abnormal profit, even if it was only 40% of the fee rather than 86%."

The main finding of the paper is that order flow in the gilt market does not appear to have any significant effect on prices, market makers seem to use other information (such as public announcements and the price of the long gilt future) to set prices. The paper also finds that spreads are far narrower in the gilt market than in the equity market and that there is some tendency for spreads to fall with trade size (rather than rise as is found in the equity markets). Both these findings are consistent with a lack of information in order flow (since market makers are unlikely to lose money to more informed traders in the gilt market and so can offer better prices). Other findings include a tendency for turnover to be highest on Wednesdays and for intra-day turnover to show a 'U'-shaped pattern with trading concentrated in the early morning and late afternoon. It also finds a tendency for spreads to be wider when turnover is high."

 """,1995.,Wage Interactions: Comparisons or Fall-back Options?,"37, Bank of England.","It is widely accepted that wage comparisons with other firms play an important part in wage bargaining, but what is less clear is precisely why these comparisons are important. There are two main explanations. First, that fairness considerations mean workers are unwilling to see their wage fall below that offered in other similar firms. Second, that wages in other firms constitute a worker's fall-back option since if the worker leaves his current firm he will probably seek employment in the same industry. Unfortunately, it is difficult to distinguish between these two explanations since both offer similar predictions. This paper proposes that these two explanations can be differentiated by looking at the role of 'pay leaders' (firms that set the standard for later settlements and which, anecdotal evidence suggests, dominate changes in pay and conditions in an industry) in wage bargaining. If the fall back option is important then the pay leader should only influence wages in other firms to the extent that the pay leader firm constitutes one of many firms that workers could move to. If, on the other hand, fairness is important then the pay leader can have a disproportionate influence by creating the standard for other wage negotiations. Using a unique panel of data covering 321 bargaining units in the UK chemical industry between 1978 and 1989, the paper then looks at the influence of the pay leader in that industry (ICI) on wage setting in other firms. It finds that the ICI wage does indeed have a disproportion effect on wage bargains in other firms; indeed ICI's wage dominates all other measures that capture the worker's fall-back option. This supports the notion that it is fairness considerations that drive wage interactions."

Strong and significant effects from narrow money through to nominal GDP and, in particular, prices are found. Broader measures of money/credit - M4, M4 lending to Divisia - do much less well at an aggregate level. But sectoral disaggregation helps matters: for example, corporate M4 and Divisia appear to have a reliable mapping with investment and production and some measures of prices. However, none of the monetary aggregates offer sufficiently robust early warning signals to justify intermediate target status. Rather the message is that, when used alongside other information variables such as the Banks inflation projection, some of the monetary aggregates offer useful corroborative information about incipient activity and price developments."

This decomposition is applied to UK short and long-maturity nominal bonds and index-linked bonds using data between 1983 and 1993. The main findings are that changes in expected inflation are by far the most important determinant of bond price movements. So much so that even for index-linked bonds changes in expected inflation (which have an effect due to the eight month indexation lag) are a more important factor than changes in real interest rates (which contribute less than 3% to the variance of index-linked bond prices). The paper also finds that changes in expected term premia are an important determinant of changes in both nominal and index-linked bond prices. However, the term premia appears to be a common factor which has little influence on the relative price of the two types of bond (ie break-even inflation rates). This suggests that changes in the relative price of the two type of bonds offer a reliable measure of changes in market expectations of inflation with about 95% of the variance of relative yields being due to revisions to expected inflation."

 """,1995.,Measuring Core Inflation,"31, Bank of England.","Many alternative measures of core, or underlying, inflation have been proposed that are based on stripping out some unwanted or excessively volatile elements from the headline rate. A potential drawback of such measures is that they are necessarily atheoretic - based largely on purely statistical procedures. This paper proposes an alternative method of measuring core inflation utilising an explicit economic definition. It defines core inflation as that part of measured inflation that has no medium or long term impact on real output - a notion that is consistent with the vertical long-run Phillips curve. This definition captures the commonly held view that moderate movements in inflation can have no impact on the real economy once financial and wage contracts have been written taking it into account. Using this definition the paper estimates a measure of core inflation using the VAR identification technique developed by Blanchard and Quah. The estimated measure indicates that core inflation was higher than measured inflation in the early 80s suggesting that measured inflation was depressed by beneficial supply shocks. The opposite effect occurred in the late 80s. Currently, core inflation is above measured inflation."

This paper analyses UK inflation between 1950 and 1994 using the ARCH methodology, which enables inflation uncertainty to be modelled directly. It examines two questions; first, what is the precise form of the relationship between shocks to the level of inflation and future inflation uncertainty? Second, what is the relationship between inflation uncertainty and the level of inflation? The paper finds that future inflation uncertainty is much more sensitive to 'bad' news (unexpected increases in inflation) than 'good' news. In fact, uncertainty appears almost unaffected when inflation outturns are lower than expected. It also finds that inflation uncertainty is indeed higher when inflation is high though the precise form of this relationship is difficult to estimate."

It follows the approach of Merton who viewed deposit insurance as, essentially, a put option on the value of the bank's assets. Three models are analysed, each embodying a different assumption about the bank closure rule. First, it is assumed that closures occur on given (annual) audit dates if the banks assets are less than its total insured deposits. Second, an endogenous closure rule is considered where the authorities allow the ailing bank to continue operating as long as the shareholders are willing to meet its operating losses. Third, an extension of model two is analysed where the authorities themselves can subsidise the ailing bank, thus postponing liquidation. The paper then estimates the value of deposit insurance in these three models using share price data from eight large UK banks. For each model the deposit insurance premiums vary significantly across banks and across models (though bank rankings across models was relatively stable). The paper concludes that option pricing models don't provide a useful guide for setting the level of deposit insurance premiums. They could, however, give insights as to the relative cost of deposit insurance across banks."

This measure of inflation has been constructed in order to gain more insight into the movements in the Government's target measure of retail price inflation, RPIX, which excludes only mortgage interest payments. The technical reason for wanting to strip out the effects of taxation is similar to that for excluding mortgage interest payments from the target measure. An increase in indirect taxes will usually cause a step rise in the RPIX level (although often spread over a period of two or three months). This in turn will lead to a temporary increase in the 12 month inflation rate for at least a year. Hence tax changes introduce a ""noise"" element in the inflation rate. If one is concerned, with price inflation in the medium term then it is useful to know what the effect of this noise is. Starting with the May 1993 Inflation Report, we have been developing the RPIY so that we can understand how indirect tax changes are impacting on RPIX inflation.

Fundamental disagreements about the desirable pace of economic reform, together with the need for radical changes in the pattern of economic activity, greatly weakened the case for retention of a single currency. Also, by mid-1993, the reformers in Russia had realised that continued use of the rouble by the republics weakened the authorities' ability to control monetary developments. The introduction of new currencies in countries lacking experience of economic policy making is bound to be a messy and uncertain process. The paper discusses the policy choices involved, in particular the appropriate exchange rate regime and the possible role for a currency board as a way of giving monetary policy credibility at an early stage in the transition. It concludes that bringing the fiscal position under control should be the first aim of policy for these countries. In the absence of bond markets deficits will tend to be money financed and the choice of exchange rate regime, by itself, is probably of second-order importance. The paper concludes with seven case studies, including the Baltic States and the Ukraine. When the paper was written, some republics had inflation rates of 25% a month or more, and there seemed little prospect of a rapid fall. In fact performance has generally been rather better than then seemed likely. The main reasons for this seem to have been the absence of a 'flight-from-money' typical of Latin-American hyperinflation. Fiscal deficits have been kept under reasonable control, probably as a result of external pressure."

Even with such a relatively simple interest rate process, the patterns of credit exposure are found to be more complex than the supervisors previous techniques allow: they vary with the level of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the volatility of the short rate - all factors which are ignored in the supervisors risk measurement methodology - and have a significantly non-linear relationship with swap maturity. In conclusion, market traders and regulators need to be alert to these factors in determining the appropriate level of capital to hold as protection against counterparty default."

 """,1993.,An Empirical Analysis of M4 in the United Kingdom,"21, Bank of England.","This paper presents some econometric modelling of M4 balances. It extends earlier Bank research on M4 by looking separately at personal and corporate holdings of money, and applies some recent advances in econometric methodology. The results confirm the importance of sectoral analysis. The results are especially encouraging for the personal sector where a significant role is found for wealth, interest rates and inflation. More surprising is the finding that simultaneous estimation of money demand and a consumption function improves both specification - the dynamic interaction of money and consumption may have an important role to play in explaining the recent behaviour of both variables. Corporate sector analysis is more problematic. The analysis and empirical results both suggest that interest rates must be explained simultaneously with corporate sector M4 balances. But no stable model of interest rates is found. Nevertheless a relatively simple model can be estimated for corporate sector M4. The results suggest that the effects of financial liberalisation can be captured by a combination of wealth and interest rate differentials. To the extent that wealth/income ratios become more stable, M4 velocity may also stabilise in the future."

 """,1993.,M0: Causes and Consequences,"20, Bank of England.","This paper analyses four aspects of the determination and effects of M0 using annual, quarterly and monthly data. First it analyses the issue of the correct scale variable for determining M0. A combination of survey evidence and statistical tests indicate that retail sales is the most appropriate scale variable to use in looking at M0. Second, the paper looks at the best way to explain the trend in M0 velocity. It confirms earlier results showing that a cumulative interest rate term gives an adequate representation of the trend and is better than a linear time trend for this purpose. Third, the paper looks at the short-run interest elasticity of demand for M0. It finds that this elasticity is highly variable across models and suggests that the analysis of M0 is problematic following substantial changes in interest rates. Lastly, and probably most controvertially it looks at the leading indicators of properties in M0 for inflation. It finds that these are particularly robust and cannot be matched simply by the product of the explanatory terms in the M0 equation. Although this result is implicit in previous work done in the Bank (eg 'VAR models of inflation' Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, May 1993) this paper makes an explicit empirical link between M0 and inflation."

 """,1993.,The Effect of Futures Trading on Cash Market Volatility: Evidence from the London Stock Exchange,"19, Bank of England.","The stock market crash of October 1987 and the growing importance of index arbitrage and portfolio insurance helped to focus the attention of academics, practitioners and regulators on the possibly destabilising role of equity index futures on the underlying cash market. Although theoretical evidence on this question is somewhat ambiguous, empirical evidence, relating particularly to US markets, has been less equivocal: typically, no significant effect of futures trading has been found. This paper presents an analysis of daily stock price volatility on the London Stock Exchange for the period 1980-93. The measure of volatility produced is appropriate, given the distribution of returns and the time-varying nature of stock price volatility, and changes in monetary policy regime. The impact of futures on stock price volatility is measured within an augmented ARCH framework and the principal result is striking: rather than increasing volatility, index futures contracts are found to have reduced volatility significantly by around 17%."

 """,1993.,Interest rates and the channels of monetary transmission: some sectoral estimates,"18, Bank of England.","The monetary transmission mechanism describes the channels through which changes in monetary policy affect the policy target, price inflation. Understanding the transmission mechanism is thus central to the successful conduct of monetary policy. This paper uses a Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) methodology to uncover a number of stylised features of the monetary transmission process in the UK. In particular, close attention is paid to the role played by money and credit as intermediate channels. The possibility that the transmission mechanism may differ across sectors is allowed for by estimating separate VARs for the personal and corporate sectors. Three policy conclusions emerge. First, as suggested by Classical Theory, monetary policy is output neutral over the longer term. Second, the lags between changes in monetary policy and its effect upon prices are lengthy (at least 18 months). And third, that aggregate measures of money and credit may provide blurred signals of the impact of monetary policy in final variables. Sectoral measures of bank deposits (for companies) and bank credit (for persons) provide the more timely intermediate indicators."

 """,1993.,Interest rate control in a model of monetary policy,"17, Bank of England.","A monetary economy comprises a vast array of market-clearing interest rates. Central banks exert a direct influence over only a narrow subset of these rates: the rate at which they supply marginal funds to the commercial banking system. Accordingly, the market interest rates which impinge upon real activity are typically distinct form - though not independent of - the official interest rate. This paper develops a formal model of the interactions between the central bank, commercial banks and the non-bank private sector. This model is then used to analyse the relationship between the official interest rate and 'other' market rates. Some illustrative evidence on the extent of the imperfection in the UK authorities' interest rate control is also considered. Two policy conclusions emerge. First the authorities must understand the nature of the feed-through of official interest rates into market rates when deciding on the appropriate level of the monetary instrument. Second, the possibility that interest rates may not all move perfectly in line, implies that policy-makers and commentators alike need to be conscious of this plurality of interest rates when assessing the overall tightness or looseness of monetary conditions."

It is found that short-term libor rates follow a random walk with time-varying volatility and with interest rate changes drawn from a distribution with fat tails, (sic). The nature of interest rate changes is sensitive to monetary regime: interest rate changes in the pre-ERM regime are drawn from a distribution with much faster tails than for the ERM regime. These statistical characterisations of libor rates are inconsistent with existing models for pricing interest rate and bond options, which assume either that interest rates follow a random walk with constant volatility, or that interest rates are mean-reverting."

Sectoral productivity differences, international competitive pressures - perhaps linked to ERM membership, and government demand for non tradables are possible reasons. Empirical estimates of sectoral price equations are presented for the UK, using especially constructed RPI- based series. Competing import prices, unit labour costs, and input prices are found to be the main determinants of tradable prices. For non-tradables government demand is important. Tests show that tradable prices Granger-cause non-tradable prices in France, Germany and Italy as well as the UK."

 """,1993.,"House prices, arrears and possessions: A three equation model for the UK","14, Bank of England.","The current slump in the UK housing market has coincided with record increases in mortgage arrears and possessions. Falling nominal house prices reduce the amount of unwithdrawn equity in housing and, under certain conditions, provide incentives for borrowers to accumulate arrears and for lenders to possess. However, possessions may themselves depress house prices. This paper attempts to analyse and quantify these interactions by estimating a three equation econometric model of UK mortgage arrears, possessions and house prices, in which expectations of future house prices are formed according to the rational expectations hypothesis. The model is simulated to examine the implications of interest rate changes and policies to reduce possessions."

 """,1993.,Temporary cycles or volatile trends? Economic fluctuations in 21 OECD economies,"13, Bank of England.","Whether it is feasible to use various types of economic policy measures to reduce fluctuations in economic activity will depend on the source of the fluctuations. In particular, policy should respond in different ways to transitory disturbances to aggregate demand and more permanent shifts in aggregate supply. The paper uses small structural var autoregressions to distinguish between these two types of disturbances. The models utilise price and output data in each of 21 OECD economies. The results indicate the supply and demand disturbances are of roughly equal importance in explaining fluctuations in growth and inflation across this wide range of economies. This supports the view that economic fluctuations cannot be characterised as a cyclical changes around a fixed trend (the Keynesian synthesis) or as continual movements in underlying supply potential (a view of real business cycle theorists). Rather, they are an amalgam of both effects. Amongst the G7 economies, demand shocks have the greatest effect on output in the UK and US, and weakest in Japan and Germany. These results support the general view of activeness of government policy in these countries and provide little evidence of successful stabilisation. A method of distinguishing the effects of output and inflation on each type of disturbance is then outlined. This makes it possible to measure 'supply potential' for each economy; there is evidence of a steady decline in the rate of increase in supply potential over time, a view consistent with the 'catch up' theory of post-war economic growth."

 """,1993.,The effect of changes in official UK rates on market interest rates since 1987,"10, Bank of England.","It is widely accepted that a central bank, such as the Bank of England, has the ability to control very short-term interest rates. Moreover, a number of studies have documented the very close relationship between Bank-administered rates (notably the Band 1 stop rate) and their market analogues. This paper investigates the extent to which the Bank is able to influence market interest rates more generally, as opposed to just very short-term interest rates, by analysing the reaction of market interest rates to the thirty movements in the Bank's Band 1 stop rate between the beginning of 1987 and July 1991. The movements of interest rates at seven different maturities (1, 3, 6 and 12-months and 5, 10 and 20-years) were considered. The results suggest that changes in the Bank of England's Band 1 stop rate lead to significant responses in market interest rates ranging in maturity from 1-month to 5-years. These findings are supportive of the proposition that longer maturity rates are influenced by expectations of the future path of short rates, and hence in part by the current level of official rates. In addition, there was evidence of systematic movements in money market interest rates both in the days leading up to the policy change and, more surprisingly, on the day immediately following the changes. Finally, preliminary estimates suggest that the reaction of market rates increases when the change in interest rates coincides with a switch in the direction of these official changes. This may reflect the markets' recognition that when the direction of interest rate changes has just switched, the probability that this change will be reversed in the near future is lessened."

 """,1993.,"A simple model of money, credit and aggregate demand","7, Bank of England.","The paper presents a theoretical model of how banks and the non-bank private sector respond to changes in monetary policy. Unlike many textbook models in which banks play no active role, the banking sector is recognised here as playing a key part in transmitting changes in monetary policy to the real economy. In a conventional IS/LM model, the impact of a change in monetary policy arises from the response of expenditure to changes in interest rates (the ""monetary"" channel). If, however, bank and non-bank sources of credit are not perfect substitutes (for example because some borrowers have only limited access to capital markets) then changes in monetary policy could also have an effect through their impact on the availability or the relative price of bank credit (a ""credit"" channel). The paper sets out the conditions under which this credit channel reinforces or weakens the impact of changes in monetary policy on the behaviour of the non-bank private sector. One example of the case where the credit channel could weaken the impact of changes in monetary policy would be where banks do not pass on changes in official interest rates fully or immediately to some of their customers. In this context the paper acknowledges the results of the two Bank studies of bank lending to small businesses."

 """,1993.,An investigation of the effect of funding on the slope of the yield curve,"6, Bank of England.","Market practitioners often have a firm view that funding operations have clearly observable effects on the slope of the yield curve. The standard theory of the expectations model of the yield curve, however, suggests that the sole determinant of the slope of the yield curve is expectations of future short-rates and so funding policy, ceteris paribus, should have no effect. This paper develops a high frequency set of data for the UK yield curve. Principal components are used to decompose the yield curve into a set of factors which represent the level of returns, the slope of the curve and higher order effects. The paper concentrates on the determinants of the second principal component as a measure of the slope and use a GARCH-M model to investigate the effects of funding on this variable. Strongly significant effects are found from the stock of government bonds of varying maturity bands on the slope of the yield curve. This supports the practitioners view and argues that factors such as market segmentation are more important than simple theories might suggest."

It is estimated that deregulation caused an autonomous fall of 2 1/4% in the personal saving rate of the United Kingdom over the 1980s."

Related issues concerning externalities from banking activity, which entail a deviation of private from social measures of banking output, are outlined. For output, the national accounts, production and intermediation approaches are compared. As regards productivity, both partial and total factor productivity measures, and the DEA and parametric approaches to the latter are assessed. The externalities from banking are shown to include contributions to economic development, external economies of scale between institutions, and contagious effects of failures. Among the most striking results in the prevalence of technical inefficiency in banking. In addition, externality issues are rarely considered in combination nor assessed empirically. But more generally, it is also suggested that measurement techniques have often outpaced the theory of what is to be measured, notably in fields such as joint production, risk and competition. Alternative approaches to address these issues are suggested."

The real interest differential - and hence tests of real interest parity - provide a summary measure of the degree of residual integration necessary such that these conditions are met. Empirical tests suggest a rejection of real interest parity among European Monetary System (EMS) member countries, at least during recent years. Further, a decomposition of the differential suggests that imperfect integration of goods markets, as reflected in a failure of ex-ante PPP, is largely responsible for this finding."

This paper addresses some of the convergence issues currently being raised in the debate over Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe, with particular emphasis on the behaviour of real interest rates. The important distinction between static and dynamic convergence is highlighted. A standard analytical framework is presented which illustrates the importance of the components of the real interest differential - namely capital controls, risk premia and the real exchange rate - as endogenous mechanisms for the transmission of policy. As such, variations in the real interest differential are shown potentially to be important for ensuring dynamic convergence to a steady-state EMU."
