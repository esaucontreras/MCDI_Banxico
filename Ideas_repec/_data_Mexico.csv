 """,2025.,Early effects of nearshoring in the manufacturing labor market in Mexico,"2025-16, Banco de México.","We apply the synthetic control method to analyze the initial effects of nearshoring on labor outcomes in Mexico's manufacturing sector from July 2020 to June 2023. Our methodology compares jobs, earnings, and productivity among industry groups more likely to be affected by nearshoring, as identified through a propensity index, with a counterfactual constructed from less likely affected industries. Our results indicate that nearshoring is potentially generating early gains in manufacturing jobs but has not led to improvements in earnings. Furthermore, we do not observe a consistent impact on productivity, although some specifications suggest a modest positive effect in industries with a higher nearshoring propensity. While nearshoring effects may take longer to materialize, our findings highlight its initial implications for the Mexican manufacturing sector."

 """,2025.,"Outsourcing, Labor Regulations and Profit-Sharing: Evidence from Mexico","2025-15, Banco de México.","This paper studies the use of domestic outsourcing to circumvent labor benefits and its consequences for firms and workers. Drawing on longitudinal establishment data and employer-employee data from Mexico, we provide evidence that many firms were outsourcing their entire workforce to avoid mandatory profit-sharing. A model shows that the incentive for this practice arises when firms face a labor supply curve that is less elastic to profit-sharing than to wages. We then leverage a reform that restricted outsourcing to assess the model predictions. The reform caused previously-outsourcing establishments to insource their workers and comply with profit-sharing, with no evidence of an effect on total employment. Treated plants partially offset the profit-sharing increase through lower wage growth, yet total worker compensation increased, consistent with our model. Self-collected survey evidence suggests that inelasticity to profit-sharing is partly explained by information frictions among workers, implying that they benefited from the reform."

 """,2025.,An estimation of the Phillips curve in Mexico using city-level data,"2025-14, Banco de México.","We estimate the slope of the Phillips curve in Mexico between 2005 and 2020 using city level data. We overcome the endogeneity of unemployment and core inflation through a panel instrumental variable strategy. Time-period fixed effects account for aggregate supply, demand, and expectation variables, while possible endogeneity between unemployment and core inflation at the city-quarter level is addressed with local labor demand shock instruments. We find a statistically significant Phillips curve linking local unemployment to local core inflation in Mexico, but this relationship is relatively weak: an increase of 1 percentage point in city-level unemployment lowers year-on-year core inflation by approximately 0.18 percentage points. We analyze city-level characteristics that relate to steeper Phillips curves, and find that informality rates, cash transfers, and some demographic characteristics in cities strengthen the relationship between unemployment and inflation."

 """,2025.,Inflation volatility across advanced and emerging economies during the COVID-19 pandemic,"2025-13, Banco de México.","Using a sample of advanced and emerging economies, this paper studies the volatility of three inflation measures from January 2001 to March 2023, employing variants of the GARCH model that account for the sign, magnitude, and persistence of shocks. The results show that the inflation surge during the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with increased volatility in several countries. However, this is not the norm in the studied period. Descriptive evidence indicates that a strong positive correlation between inflation and its volatility within countries was observed at the beginning of the Global Financial Crisis and during the pandemic, two periods characterized by global inflationary pressures and high commodity prices, whereas in other periods, this correlation is nonexistent or weak."

 """,2025.,The Balance Sheet Channel of Fiscal Policy: Sovereign Exposure and Credit to Firms in the European Periphery,"2025-12, Banco de México.","This paper provides empirical evidence on the balance sheet channel of fiscal policy in peripheral European economies. Our findings using a Panel VAR, reveal that shifts in financial institutions' balance sheets following a debt-financed fiscal expansion, reduce credit provision and investment in these countries. Moreover, the analysis indicates that economies with higher sovereign exposure experienced higher credit crunches and investment declines. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we estimate a DSGE model that incorporates banks as primary holders of sovereign debt. The model shows that sovereign exposure amplifies the negative effects on credit supply, lowering investment and capital formation. A counterfactual scenario without bank-held sovereign bonds isolates the contribution of the balance sheet channel: removing this channel weakens the crowding-out effect, with investment falling 0.2 percentage points less and output increasing by 0.02 percentage points more. These effects appear stronger during the financial and sovereign debt crises."

 """,2025.,The effect of avian influenza outbreaks on table-egg prices: evidence from the Mexican market,"2025-11, Banco de México.","This paper investigates the effect of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreaks on table-egg prices in Mexico. The analysis relies on monthly panel data of the price index of table eggs at the city level linked to records of HPAI outbreaks occurred in producing municipalities. Our findings suggest that exposure to an average HPAI outbreak immediately increases the price of table eggs by 1.5% relative to the price that would be observed in a scenario without HPAI. Exposure to HPAI outbreaks also has lagged effects. The highest increase (4.8%) is observed two months after the outbreak. Afterwards, the effect decreases and vanishes by the seventh month. Our results also suggest that the impact of HPAI outbreaks on the price of table eggs has decreased over time mainly due to a lower frequency and intensity of HPAI outbreaks possibly associated with an increased efficiency of the protocols of prevention, surveillance, control and eradication of HPAI outbreaks."

 """,2025.,Energy Efficiency and Mitigation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Mexico's Manufacturing Sector,"2025-10, Banco de México.","This study examines the energy efficiency and environmental performance of Mexico's manufacturing sector across regions. We employ a Data Envelopment Analysis model that optimizes the weighted output-input ratio for each decision-making unit. Specifically, a non-radial directional distance function model is used to account for both desirable outputs and undesirable outputs, represented by greenhouse gas emissions. The findings show that including undesirable outputs reduces the estimated economic efficiency. Over the analysis period, the production frontier shifted only modestly. Regionally, northern states perform best, while southern states lag behind, revealing considerable potential for national energy and emission savings."

 """,2025.,"Better or worse job accessibility? Understanding changes in spatial mismatch: evidence from Medellín, Colombia","2025-09, Banco de México.","We propose a methodology to calculate the mismatch between places of work and places of residence that incorporates monetary and opportunity transportation costs while correcting for possible overestimation of job accessibility. This methodology enables the analysis of spatiotemporal changes in spatial mismatch without discarding data from spatial units that change over time. We apply the methodology to measure spatial mismatch in Medellín, Colombia, for public and private transportation from 2012 to 2017. In line with previous work, our results indicate that including transportation and opportunity costs leads to a more realistic measure of job availability. Despite investments in public transportation and infrastructure, spatial mismatch in Medellín increased between 2012 and 2017. Our analysis shows that job accesibility through private transport decreased more than through public transport, and that the expansion of the latter in Medellín may have mitigated spatial mismatch."

 """,2025.,Do climate policies incentivize firms to commit to setting a GHG emissions target?,"2025-08, Banco de México.","Since the 2016 Paris Agreement, countries and companies have been increasingly pressured to adopt appropriate response measures to climate change. However, it is not clear what factors drive firms to undertake climate change actions. Using a correlated random effects panel probit model, this paper contributes to the literature by analyzing the influence of advances in climate policies, as measured by the Climate Change Performance Index, on firms committing to set a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target. We find that advances in national climate policies are associated with a higher probability of firms committing, particularly for firms in the non-financial sectors and, among them, for those that do not belong to sectors considered as the largest producers of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Lastly, the availability of funding for green projects, indirectly measured by the issuance of green bonds per country, also positively contributes to the probability of firms committing."

 """,2025.,Comparison of Inflation Expectations from Surveys and Markets Across Different Horizons,"2025-07, Banco de México.","This paper compares inflation expectations from surveys and markets across different horizons for Mexico, between 2000 and 2024. The analysis evalues descriptive statistics, bias, efficiency, discrepancy, convergence level, and response to inflation surprises. The results suggest that both expectations are generally biased, with exception of short-term market expectations. The two types of expectations are inefficient as they include past forecast errors and do not seem to incorporate all available information. The discrepancy between the two types of expectations is negatively related to the short-term interest rate across all horizons and positively related to inflation, its quadratic change, and exchange rate volatility for some horizons. Short- and medium-term expectations respond to inflation surprises, while long-term expectations do not. Finally, their estimated convergence level is more stable and with lower levels when information from both types of expectations is combined."

 """,2025.,Windfalls for All? International Elasticities and Dutch Disease in a Commodity Exporting Economy,"2025-06, Banco de México.","This paper analyzes the effect of commodity price fluctuations on a commodity-exporting economy. Using Chilean and international copper market data, I find that positive copper price changes resulting from copper-specific demand shocks generate a broad GDP expansion, with no visible decline in manufacturing exports. These results provide evidence against the Dutch disease hypothesis, which posits the crowding-out effect of commodity price increases on the manufacturing sector. I then estimate a small open economy business-cycle model and find that a low degree of substitution between domestic and foreign goods explains the positive sectoral effect of a commodity price shock. Finally, I evaluate how tariffs on imports determine the volatility of total output in response to commodity price shocks, and find that lower tariffs reduce the volatility of total production when commodity prices fluctuate."

 """,2025.,Preferences for Renewable Energies and Green Jobs in Mexico City,"2025-05, Banco de México.","Mexico City, that boasts the first place in electricity consumption among urban centers in the country, is actively advancing its energy transition by promoting renewable energies and tapping into its potential for solar and bio-energy. As households in emerging economies drive global energy demand, this study explores preferences of Mexico City's residents. Using a discrete choice experiment, 940 residents were presented with energy contracts featuring renewable energy sources, green job creation in the energy sector, renewable energy percentages in the energy mix, and electricity prices. Estimates reveal that respondents are willing to pay a 19.5% premium over the average price per kilowatt-hour if the energy source were exclusively solar and created 1000 green jobs. These findings offer insights for other megacities with similar challenges and renewable potential in pursuing a just energy transition."

The study leverages the unique characteristics of California's gasoline market and introduces a new set of proposed instruments. As a first step, the study takes advantage of California's partially isolated gasoline market, which is separated from much of the U.S. by environmental regulations. The estimating equation controls for persistent demand shocks, leading to a lower bound for the long-run elasticity of demand of -0.23. In the second step, a new set of instruments is employed to address supply and demand simultaneity, using detailed information on refinery outages to capture short-run supply shocks. The results show that the long-run demand elasticity is -0.60."

We find that, on average, households substitute health and food expenditure in response to adverse health shocks. Our estimates unveil substantial heterogeneity in this trade-off mediated by access to social protection, job contract type, and urban or rural location. Households from rural areas --where household heads are more likely to hold informal jobs and lack access to safety nets-- engage in more substitution of food expenditure for health expenditure than others. Our findings suggest that access to formal employment and a higher quality of local institutions can help mitigate the negative consequences of health shocks for households."

 """,2025.,Temperature and quarterly economic activity: panel data evidence from Mexico,"2025-02, Banco de México.","In this paper, we estimate the effect of temperature on the economic activity of Mexico using 42 years of quarterly panel data on economic growth at the state level. Our findings reveal a concave relationship between quarterly economic growth and quarterly average temperature that is maximized at around 20 degrees Celsius. Average temperatures above this level are associated with lower economic growth rates with sharper declines for agricultural and low-income states. Temperature affects aggregate economic growth mainly through the effect it has on the growth of the primary and secondary sectors. The findings of this paper suggest that by 2100, in the absence of adaptation and under an intermediate scenario of climate change, global warming might cause a statistically significant reduction of quarterly economic growth."

The analysis employs a pairwise approach to evaluate the convergence of price differentials for each item across city pairs. Additionally, it examines the influence of geographical and economic factors on price convergence. Key findings reveal: 1) there is no evidence of market divergence across food processing categories; 2) unprocessed items exhibit the highest levels of market integration and the fastest adjustment rates; 3) price differentials for unprocessed items consistently demonstrate nationwide integration; and 4) factors such as geographical proximity, road infrastructure, and the similarity in store density between cities significantly enhance the speed of price convergence toward long-run equilibrium."

Using longitudinal administrative data and an event-study framework, we analyze the evolution of employment and wages before and after the reform. The findings show that post-reform, regularized workers were more likely to retain their positions in the private formal job sector compared to a counterfactual scenario without the reform. Moreover, due to the reform, wages for workers directly affected increased by 3-4%, with significant variation across gender, age, industry, firm size, and region, indicating a heterogeneous response to the reform. These findings underscore the varied impacts of outsourcing restrictions on different segments of the labor market, providing valuable insights into the implications of labor market regulations on employment stability and wage growth."

Using the Regional Input-Output Matrices estimated by Banco de México, and the Supply Ghosh Model, the effects associated to the supply-side shock that ensued from the sudden reduction of imported inputs from China, the European Union, and the United States at the onset of the pandemic are calculated. The Northern region experienced the greatest contraction in gross output, while at the sectoral level, the manufacturing sector gross output was the most affected by the shock relative to a scenario with constant availability of inputs. These results are consistent with the fact that both, the Northern region and the manufacturing sector, are the most integrated to the global supply chain."

Our estimates rule out statistically significant changes in the slope of the housing price gradient after 2020 Q1 with respect to the pre-pandemic period. The Mexico City case contrasts with developed-country cities, where the housing price gradient flattened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with housing price increases in the suburbs relative to central areas. Possible mechanisms behind the lack of gradient change in Mexico city could include differences in pandemic restrictions relative to other countries, a reduced potential for remote work, lack of access to finance housing purchases, and housing supply shocks."

We use a triple difference event study design where we compare employment in high and low proximity sectors across municipalities with different levels of remote work potential, before and after the pandemic. Our results contribute to explain the relatively weak recovery in high proximity employment in the central region of the country, where at the start of the pandemic a larger proportion of high-proximity services located where remote work potential was high, relative to other regions. The analysis highlights that with the pandemic the sectoral distribution of employment has changed, and that the effects on workers depend on their capacity to adjust to the new labor market."

To this end, we merge administrative micro-level data on the universe of bank loans to firms with matched employer-employee social security records. For each firm, we measure its exposure to time-varying credit supply shocks. We find that a negative credit shock of one standard deviation would have increased a firm's exit probability by 0.15 percentage points (pp) and decreased its annual employment growth by 1 pp. These effects were most pronounced among unincorporated businesses, small and young firms, and those in non-essential sectors. Negative credit supply shocks led to higher separation rates for workers with low layoff costs, like those with low tenure or temporary contracts."

 """,2024.,The Loan Puzzle in Mexico,"2024-15, Banco de México.","In some advanced and emerging economies, contrary to expectations, it has been observed that increases in short-term interest rates are accompanied by increases in bank credit; a phenomenon referred to as ""the loan puzzle."" This study investigates, through the estimation of a structural vector autoregressive model using national and sectoral-level data, whether this phenomenon occurred in the Mexican economy between 2001 and 2019. The results suggest that, in response to a positive shock to short-term interest rates, the volume of bank credit to firms exhibits a positive and short-lived response but subsequently decreases. This response is primarily observed in sectors that had the lowest average delinquency rates during the analysis period. This suggests that banks would grant more loans to relatively safer companies, while, in response to such monetary tightening, they would reduce their investments in riskier and longer-term assets, such as consumer loans and loans to the real estate sector."

Shocks are identified by combining a high-frequency strategy with sign restrictions, which exploits the co-movement between the policy rate and the stock market in the US around FOMC announcements. A restrictive monetary policy shock in the US is identified by an increase in the interest rate and a drop in stock prices, while a positive information shock is identified when both variables rise simultaneously. The results show that positive information shocks from the US central bank improve financial conditions in Mexico, appreciate the peso/dollar exchange rate, lower the sovereign risk premium and forex volatility, and increase stock prices, real activity and prices in Mexico. In contrast, restrictive US monetary policy shocks tighten financial conditions, and reduce real activity and prices in Mexico."

 """,2024.,Business Cycles when Consumers Learn by Shopping,"2024-12, Banco de México.","Empirical evidence suggests consumers rely on their shopping experiences to form beliefs about inflation. In other words, they ""learn by shopping"". I introduce this empirical observation as an informational friction in the New Keynesian model and use it to study its consequences for the transmission of aggregate shocks and the design of monetary policy. Learning by shopping anchors households' beliefs about inflation to its past, causing disagreement with firms over the value of the real wage. The discrepancy allows nominal shocks to have real effects and makes the slope of the Phillips curve a function of the monetary policy stance. As a result, a more hawkish monetary policy reduces the volatility and persistence of inflation, increases the degree of anchoring of households' inflation expectations, and flattens the slope of the Phillips curve of the economy."

Although several measures of persistence have been proposed in the literature, when they are empirically applied, the different measures indicate incompatible messages, as they differ both in the level and the implied evolution of persistence. One plausible reason why persistence estimators may differ is the presence of data particularities such as trends, cycles, measurement errors, additive and temporary change outliers, and structural changes. To gauge the usefulness and robustness of different measures of persistence, we compare them in a univariate time series framework using Monte Carlo simulations. We consider nonparametric, semiparametric, and parametric time-domain and frequency-domain persistence estimators and investigate their performance under different anomalies found in practice. Our results indicate that the nonparametric method is, on average, less affected by the different types of time series anomalies analyzed in this work."

Through the lens of a duration model, we find evidence of both time- and state-dependency behavior. Favoring time-dependency, on the one hand, estimates indicate that price spells exhibit greater risk of ending every seven days relative to other days in between. Advocating for state-dependency, the probability of price changes seems to be affected by variations in the USD/MXN exchange rate, variations in real point of sales expenditures and the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, leveraging data gathered via direct visits to brick-and-mortar stores, we also find time-dependency and state-dependency in the duration of price spells."

To uncover these changes, we analyze an employer-employee dataset comprising the near-universe of Mexico's formal employment. We estimate log wage models and decompose earnings dispersions into worker, workplace and sorting components. At the national level, we find that sorting increased its importance over time. While worker-level factors were the main contributors to salary variability in the 2004-2008 period, workplace factors became as important as worker-level factors in the 2014-2018 time segment. The influence of workplace factors on wage dispersion correlates negatively with per capita GDP at the regional level."

For these businesses, construction pressures prices downwards; in contrast, operation is associated with partial price recoveries.

I collected and digitized historical tax records (1800) and connected them to contemporary ones (2010s) via surnames. Employing a TS2SLS approach, I find that a 10 percentage point (pp) increase in a surname's concertaje rate reduces the current formal income of (pseudo) descendants by 1.7%. On a regional scale, I establish a causal relationship by leveraging variations in concertaje intensity due to differences in crop labor requirements. IV estimates show that a 10 pp rise in a district's concertaje rate increases contemporary poverty by 4.2 pp. As channels of persistence, I show that concertaje historically led to lower education levels, reduced public goods provision, increased agricultural employment, and inequality. Concertaje also limited mobility, although its effect on immigrants is milder, suggesting migration acted as a mitigation channel."

We also find that narrative signals related to monetary policy, observed inflation, aggregate demand, and inflation and employment projections stand out as the most relevant in accounting for changes in analysts' expectations. If the period of the COVID-19 pandemic is excluded, we still find that forecasters consider both types of information for their inflation expectations."

These formulas unify existing canonical ones and feature a new term capturing the effect of variety on consumer surplus. Intuitively, if taxes reduce product varieties in the market, then the impact on social welfare depends on how much consumers value variety. As a proof-of-concept, we use the theoretical formulas to identify love-of-variety preferences in an empirical application. Our welfare analysis shows that the marginal excess burden of taxation is very sensitive to the estimated love-of-variety, which can overturn classical results on the desirability of ad valorem versus specific taxation."

This paper contributes by developing a theoretical matching model to study the optimal menu of licenses designed to screen foster parents.

We focus on incentive compatible contracts, examine optimal allocations and transfers, and analyze equilibrium sorting patterns. There are three main results: (i) optimal allocation calls for a segregation of the market, (ii) a simple transfer schedule does the job, (iii) complementarities do not ensure that Positive Assortative Matching (PAM) will arise in equilibrium, thus we provide an additional condition that guarantees it. Our results suggests that the menu of licenses used in practice, exhibits some of the properties of the optimal solution. However, the menu might not be reaching its screening objective."

The model is calibrated for the United States and reproduces the effect of variations in the price of financial assets on aggregate demand. The results show, first, that in the presence of productivity, financial, and demand shocks, optimal monetary policy significantly improves aggregate welfare by stabilizing financial fluctuations that impact households' wealth. Secondly, in the face of productivity and financial shocks, an augmented monetary rule responding explicitly to fluctuations in the price of financial assets, in addition to inflation and output gaps, can reproduce the welfare achieved under optimal monetary policy. However, this is not the case for demand shocks."

The results suggest that during the COVID-19 crisis period, women's control of resources decreased relative to the non-recession period (4-5 percentage points) and the financial crisis (6-8 percentage points). This effect was more pronounced for households with children than those without children. Finally, I look into how this resource reallocation affects household consumption and individual poverty. The results of this paper highlight the heterogeneous behavior of intra-household inequality and women's bargaining power over the business cycle. It also suggests that the hypothesis that the financial crisis was a ""man-cession"" and the COVID-19 crisis was a ""she-cession"" holds in terms of intra-household resource allocation."

Similarly, firms with a bank account to operate their business were more affected than those firms without a bank account. Finally, insecurity and corruption faced by firms, especially in the service sector, are structural factors related to the misallocation of resources in Mexico."

Shift-sharing analysis reveals that the primary reason for this is the lack of labor reallocation towards more productive industries, and the underperformance of some of the largest ones. Unconditional convergence at all levels only occurred during 1988-1998. Afterward, the convergence process broke down and was only observed at disaggregated levels. I provide evidence that one possible cause of this breakdown is the so-called ""China shock"".

Thereafter, I develop a two-sided search and matching model used to rationalize the empirical facts and carry out predictions regarding match quality. Interestingly, I find that match separation plays a crucial role in adoption by influencing the incentives of foster parents to adopt. Due to the presence of a financial penalty on adoption, parents accept the penalty in exchange for eliminating the likelihood that the child separates from the match in the future. Moreover, I show that the adoption penalty not only exacerbates the intrinsic disadvantage (being less preferred by foster parents) faced by children with a disability, but it also creates incentives for high-quality matches to not transit to adoption."

With complete law enforcement in the illegal drug market, the workers in that sector would relocate to the productive sector, and aggregate production would increase. Without crimes against businesses, which would allow a reallocation of work, capital, and occupations to the formal sector, production would increase even more.

It identifies 24 clusters and analyzes their geographical distribution, their role in regional growth, the evolution of their employment concentration, and their spillover effects. The main findings suggest that manufacturing-oriented clusters have a strong presence in the Northern states of the country, while services-oriented clusters in the Central ones. Finally, clusters such as plastic products manufacturing; retail and eating services; food and beverage manufacturing; and, automotive show relatively high direct and indirect spillover effects on the economy."

Agents interact in a three-stage game: 1. A policymaker chooses a reference price to maximize consumer welfare. 2. Firms make their entry decision. 3. Firms compete in prices and consumers make their consumption decisions. We find that in equilibrium the market price and the optimal reference price chosen by the policymaker always coincide. In addition, it is shown that the use of reference prices reduces market equilibrium prices compared with the case without reference prices, which implies a net welfare gain for consumers. These gains could be higher in less competitive environments and lower in the presence of higher marginal costs."

For small minimum wage increases, most counties would receive higher low-wage commuting and have fewer low-wage residents. As minimum wage increases are larger, there are higher low-wage commuting reductions driven by employment relocation."

 """,2020.,On the Drivers of Inflation in Different Monetary Regimes,"2020-16, Banco de México.","This document proposes a general macroeconomic framework to analyze the behavior of inflation. This approach has two characteristics. The first is the distinction of monetary regimes based on the number of shocks that have a permanent effect on the price level. When all shocks have a permanent impact, the regime determines the inflation rate, as in inflation targeting. On the other hand, when there is only one shock with permanent effects, the regime determines the price level. An example of this is a regime with a fixed exchange rate. Even if there is no explicit target for the domestic price level, this becomes determined by the operation of a regime of this type. The second characteristic comes from the factors that Granger cause the rate of inflation or the price level. With this, a new perspective on four different historical cases emerges. One is the German hyperinflation; the second is that of the United States for a very long sample. For Brazil and Mexico, the analysis demonstrates that their inflationary processes' complexity arises from the regime changes they have gone through."

However, we find geographical differences in the speed of pass-through that cannot be explained by differences in station density. We conjecture that coordination on high prices could be offsetting competitive pressure in some locations. We build a classifier that separates municipalities into two categories depending on whether the relative price concentration is on ""high"" prices or ""low"" prices. In the first type of municipalities, the price concentration is correlated positively with the price level and negatively with pass-through. For concentration in ""low"" prices the signs of the correlations are reversed."

We exploit this variation to identify the effect of increased uncertainty on FDI flows. We find that the increase in TPU was associated with a negative effect on FDI inflows, with the effect being driven by the negative impact that TPU had on FDI in export oriented states."

Second, using a heterogeneous agent model, I show that the decrease in the saving rate of the bottom groups cannot be rationalized by the reduction in the progressively of taxation or changes in the volatility and concentration of labor earnings. Lastly, I introduce a shock to the credit market into the model in the form of loosening the borrowing constraints of the economy. This shock can simultaneously match the increase in wealth concentration and the decrease of the saving rate of the economy."

The central bank should optimally anchoring private agents expectations in the short term in exchange of easier future intratemporal trade-offs. Compared to the rational expectations equilibrium, the possibility to conduct robust monetary policy is limited in a small open economy under learning for any exchange rate pass-through level and any degree of trade openness. The misspecification that can be introduced into all equations of the model is lower in a small open economy, and approaches zero at high speed as the learning gain rises."

It is found that the cross-sectional variation of exports is mostly accounted for the extensive margins of trade, particularly the extensive margin of number of products exported, while the time-series variation in aggregate exports is mostly accounted for by the intensive margin of trade, and in particular by the growth of exporting firms that retain their export status from year to year."

First, the paper documents deviations from covered interest parity (CIP) for Mexico after the global financial crisis (GFC), and then it evaluates the effect of two variables in a regression-based analysis: (i) the FX funding gap of domestic bank balance sheets and (ii) external foreign currency hedging demand. The main result is that both variables directly influenced CIP deviations in Mexico, and it was robust to including arbitrage funding and foreign exchange transaction costs in the regression. These results suggest hedging demand can be an important factor in emerging economies' foreign exchange forward markets, even at short maturities. One of the implications is that banks' ability to manage the currency mismatch is affected by global shocks in the foreign currency market."

The results show the following: First, portfolio flows' response to US monetary policy events is vastly homogeneous across regions, whilst the reaction to Euro Area or UK polices are more diverse. Second, US policies have a bigger effect on portfolio flows from each of the selected advanced economies. Third, the magnitude of investors' responses is stronger towards Emerging Europe and Latin America than to Emerging Asia. These results could be useful for policymakers in emerging economies as a benchmark to anticipate differentiated effects in portfolio flows caused by monetary policy in advanced economies."

In contrast, this co-movement is not observed in emerging economies. We argue that capital flows may explain this behavior. We focus on Mexico, a benchmark emerging economy, and find that capital inflows may account for a temporary reduction in the Mexican neutral rate after the global financial crisis. These inflows surged during the implementation of unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies. In turn, low-frequency changes in the neutral rate may be attributed to increasing domestic savings, demographics, and a decreasing global long-run real interest rate. These results are largely consistent with other studies showing that the neutral rate has decreased in the last 25 years in advanced and emerging economies."

In addition, we estimate panel data regressions to explore the extent to which changes in the price and debt levels, are priced in by the (in)deflation risk premium. We generally find that deflation terms contributes negatively to such a premium and inflation positively. The magnitudes of the coefficients associated with deflation tend to be greater, compared to those associated with inflation. This suggests that deflationary costs are relatively larger than inflationary ones. We rationalize this cost asymmetry with the presence of a credit constraint under deflationary periods."

We identify cases in which the tradeoffs in terms of macroeconomic volatility between policy objectives create scope for improvement when monetary and macroprudential policies are coordinated. These improvements are generally larger when financial shocks are the main driver of macroeconomic fluctuations."

The exception refers to economies with a long tradition of financial dollarization in which the prudential policies were more spread out over time, possibly due to countercyclical adjustments of the regulatory instruments. Along these lines, policymakers reported that the first goal in using the regulation was to reduce currency mismatches, but, in the flexible regimes that were adopted during the 2000s the instruments were also used to dampen volatility in the exchange rate."

We document that changes in concentration growth contribute to explaining relative credit growth, particularly so in the group with high average concentration. However, in the group with low average concentration, relative credit growth seems to be also explained by relative labor productivity, output, and wage growth rates. We also discuss some mechanisms that might explain these results. Such mechanisms could lead to counterproductive dynamics between concentration growth and relative credit growth, for which we provide some empirical evidence."

Using a generalized version of the model in Acemoglu et al. (Econometrica, 2012), I show that the degree of influence of a given sector is equal to its value added share. This occurs because --by using the input-output network-- the output of a given sector indirectly contributes to the production of the final consumption of the rest of the sectors, which constitutes the source of its value. Thus, value-added economies deliver the same aggregate response to sectoral shocks than input-output ones. Despite this equivalence, the Leontief multiplier, which applies to sales and gross output, is intact."

We then impose a recursiveness assumption to identify the response of domestic variables to a monetary policy shock. The long-run restrictions embedded in the model are themselves identified, estimated, and tested using an ARDL methodology that is robust to the degree of persistence of the time series and, in particular, to whether they are trend- or first-difference stationary.

The data shows a strong positive correlation between TFP and output growth. As a result, tests were performed in order to determine a possible causality between these two variables, with the results not rejecting the hypothesis of causality running in both directions. Another pattern that also emerges from the data set is that TFP growth in Mexico tends to be fairly concentrated and highly irregular, as just a reduced share of the subsectors in any given time period tends to account for most of the TFP growth, and also because the distribution of their performance is far from being the same across time. These patterns are similar to those found in other data sets of the Mexican economy, as well as in data from the United States and the United Kingdom at different levels of aggregation."

This is performed in the context of an input-output economy and general equilibrium. Also, the importance of sector-specific distortions that produce cross-sector misallocation is addressed. I compute the effect of the removal of these distortions on aggregate productivity using the input-output model and find that this could increase productivity up to 68%, depending on whether the rents from distortions stay in the economy or not."

We show that lifetime earnings losses generated by job-displacement are larger for individuals with lower capacity to accumulate human capital and during an economic downturn, as documented in the empirical literature. At the aggregate level, the framework delivers youth unemployment rates that are higher and more sensitive to fluctuations in aggregate productivity than total unemployment rates. Additionally, in economies with a higher tax-wedge, unemployment rates are more sensitive to aggregate productivity shocks. A higher tax-wedge and minimum wage increase the long-term earnings losses produced by job-displacement, especially for low-skill individuals."

We find that, in comparison to economies from other regions, spreads from EMU members are lower, the relationship of spreads with variables like fiscal balance, public debt, and GDP growth rate is weaker, and their cross-country variance is statistically lower than the cross-country variance of spreads from non-EMU countries between 1999 and 2005.

Based on it, two indicators are calculated, the money gap and the m* indicator. Such gap measures deviations of real M1 from its relationship with its long-run determinants. The m* indicator is based on the estimation of the price index which is congruent with the quantity of M1 in the economy once it is adjusted for the long-run tendency of its determinants considering its long-run coefficients. Our results indicate that monetary policy has been congruent with the inflation target of Banco de México."

We find that mixed groups, unlike in-groups, reduce their exploitation of the resource in response to the threat of punishment.

This suggests that public resources for older adults might generate benefits for other age groups. An additional finding is that the increase in school enrollment takes places mostly at the program eligibility cutoff and not before. Given that the program transfer is known and potentially anticipated by individuals who are only a few years away from being eligible, this suggests that households might have credit constraints."

The model is modified and calibrated to an asymmetric equilibrium that allows the steady state of the model to match some of the US-Mexico relationships quite well. The results suggest an importance of nontraded goods in real exchange rate volatility closer to the empirical evidence. In addition, the model replicates the findings that nontraded prices exhibit higher volatility than the real exchange rate and that these prices are negatively correlated with traded goods prices."

A negative shock to the value of the capital in one country generates a global financial crisis through the international interbank market. In this model, unconventional credit policies help to mitigate the effects of a financial disruption. The policies are carried out by the policy maker of the country directly hit by the shock. Consumers of that country are better off with policy than without it, while consumers from the other country are worse off."

We analyze the aggregate effects of a revenue-neutral fiscal-cum-social policy reform that consists of: 1) the implementation of universal social insurance to replace the system with low coverage; and 2) the elimination of the social security payroll tax to replace it with a generalized VAT. We find that this reform increases productivity by 2 percent and output by 3 percent as it improves the allocation of resources across firms and sectors, and generates a substantial change in occupational choices. Thus, wages (before transfers) increase for all employees. Also, due to the reconfiguration of transfers, earnings (wages after transfers) for informal employees increase relative to the earnings of formal employees, which decreases inequality. However, the reform could affect some groups in the population, given the regressive nature of VAT and heterogeneity in the valuation of transfers across workers."

Given this distribution, how is it affected when the generosity of these transfers changes? We use a search frictions model with informality, (ex post) heterogeneous workers, and conditional taxes and transfers. In the model, formal jobs are ""better"" than informal jobs, but harder to get. Taxes are proportional to the wage, while transfers are lump sum, implying a cross-subsidy from high-income to low-income workers. As a result, the marginal worker weighs two opposing forces: changes in taxes vs. changes in transfers. We calibrate the model to Mexico and perform counterfactuals. We find that informality is quite inelastic due to frictions, and due to the opposing forces of taxes and transfers."

The authors in this group all make use of dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) models. I focus on models with heterogeneous firms and a cost of informality that is increasing with firm size: reducing informality entails a tradeoff because there are some distortions associated with the formal sector and some others with the informal. Quantitative evaluations of this tradeoff using these models show that, in general, reducing informality brings gains. In conclusion, substantial progress has been made in understanding informality and its consequences through the use of DGE models with heterogeneous firms.

Our results suggest that in the first two years of its implementation the program had no effects on math and reading scores. The absence of effect could be explained by the fact that the program did not involve compulsory teacher training and that laptops in class were mainly used to search for information on the internet."

This paper describes some structural achievements to control inflation that have been attained in Mexico. In addition, it shows empirical evidence in favor of the anchoring of inflation expectations, particularly those for the medium and long term, being recently strengthened. Considering three episodes, within the period 2004-2012, in which inflation was subject to different supply shocks, it finds that during the episode in 2012 inflation expectations showed greater stability. Results show that the response from inflation expectations to supply shocks has diminished over time, up to values that are not significantly different from zero. This suggests a strengthening of the credibility of the Bank of Mexico's commitment to price stability."

We use the bid-ask spreads as a measure of liquidity and, also, of orderly conditions. In general, our results show no indication of an effect in the bid-ask spread for the first intervention, and are fairly conclusive regarding a significant reduction in it for the second intervention, yet, it is important to consider the limitations of our estimation methodology."

The main contribution of these indexes is that they admit sub-aggregations of regions and/or sectors that are more precise and informative than their counterparts. We show two applications. In the first one, we develop the generalized diffusion index for the Mexican economy using state economic coincident indexes.

First, I construct a new digital railroad data set and pair it with geographic and topographic features of the U.S. territory to estimate travel times between every pair of U.S. counties for every year between 1840 and 1900. Second, I use these results, together with a Ricardian model of trade and U.S. county output data from the 19th century, to estimate county gains from trade using a fixed-point algorithm. Third, I estimate ounterfactuals with the railroads built up to a certain year. My estimates suggest that there was a lot of migration anticipating railroad construction and not the other way around. However, leaving all factors of production fixed, if the railroads were made suddenly unavailable in 1890 there would have been a 9.6% reduction in output, but in 1900, after the financial crisis, the impact would have been less than 9 %."

Using data from the 2010 Mexican Census, we exploit the age and locality population thresholds to identify the effects of the program. We find that the program reduces the labor force participation of elderly men, particularly of those who live alone and who are relatively poor, but has a much weaker effect on that of elderly women. The program has no statistically significant effect on the labor force participation of either prime-age men or women who live with potential beneficiaries, and it has a negative and significant effect on the labor force participation of boys age 12 to 17, particularly those in the lowest wealth quintiles, but not on that of same-age girls. These results suggest that the program affects mostly the labor supply of the intended beneficiaries, and that of marginal workers, like adolescent boys."

In the few cases for which we do find some statistical evidence of an effect, it tends to be short-lived or not economically significant. On the other hand, we find evidence that interventions which objective is to restore and/or assure the proper functioning of exchange rate markets have a higher probability of success. This probability increases as the amount of resources to intervene at the disposal of the central bank increases. Needless to say, there are limits to the methodology we use."

EI covers 90 percent approximately of the cost of enrolling a child under age four at a formal child care center and is intended to benefit women who are looking for work, in school, or working -with the exception of those who already have access to child care because their job is covered by Mexico's social security system (IMSS). The roll-out of EI was so fast and intense that, by mid-2010, it had approximately 357,000 child care spaces. In order to identify the effects of the program I use a combination of triple differences and synthetic control methods, and find that EI increased women's probability of working and reduced the time they devoted to child rearing. EI also caused women to obtain more stable jobs and it increased their labor incomes. Affected husbands spent less time on child rearing and housework, and they were more likely to switch to a better-paid job."

Uncertainty comes from prices, which is summarized in a state variable that follows a Brownian motion. Preferences have a multiple-prior utility representation where the set of priors consist of a family of Brownian motions with unknown drift and common variance.

Finally, we find that there is an optimal commitment period for the central bank to keep the nominal interest rate equal to zero (forward guidance) after a financial turmoil. Beyond that optimal period, the volatility of inflation and output rise quick and sharply. Thus, an excessive forward guidance policy may destabilize the economy."

The source of this gain is the removal of distortions induced by incomplete enforcement of taxes which affect the economy in three ways: by reducing the capital-labor ratios of informal establishments; by allowing low-productive entrepreneurs to enter; and by misallocating resources towards low-productive establishments.

While the estimation is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, the main conclusion is that net migration flows of Mexicans to the United States over the coming years are likely to increase compared to what was observed during the recent global economic crisis, but that such flows are very unlikely to reach the levels registered during the 1990s."

We find that workers index their wages to past inflation when technology and permanent inflation-target shocks drive output fluctuations; when aggregate demand shocks do, workers index to trend-inflation.

The results show that the response of firms to both types of shocks is not symmetrical in general, and that firms react to these shocks combining adjustment strategies (mostly choosing to reduce costs) to smooth the pass-through to prices and production. Stronger competition makes firms use the adjustment strategies more intensively, and it encourages price flexibility. For all shocks, the costs more likely to be reduced are non-labor costs, followed by temporary employment. A high degree of competition and a high labor share make the pass-through of shocks to employment stronger. On the other hand, collective wage agreements smooth this pass-through. Nominal wage rigidity is evident in the presence of any shock."

Our results from the first model do not differ from the ones of previous papers. However, our main finding is that it is not the CM what fails in this type of models, but rather their ability to produce sufficient variability in prices. In particular, in this model, general equilibrium dynamics counteract the logic of price fluctuations described by theoretical models thus preventing the CM from being triggered.

For each of these days, we arrange the transactions in four sets, delimited according to their value: all payments, payment orders with value higher than 100,000 MXN; transactions with value higher than 1,000,000 MXN and payments with value higher than 10,000,000 MXN. We measure the liquidity usage in different settings of settlement speed requirements. We find that among participants settlement strategies are heterogeneous. In particular, according to the size of the payment order, on weekly basis participants follow different patterns for settlement. Even further, payments within the same set are not homogeneously treated by banks."

The estimation of the sample size can be done by using the design effect estimator proposed by Kish. This estimator is also used as an efficiency measure for a probability sampling plan and to build confidence intervals. Even though the design effect estimator is widely used in practice, little is known about its statistical properties and there are no variance estimators available. In this paper we show that the design effect estimator is biased, we give an expression for an upper bound to the ratio of the bias to the standard error and a method to estimate the variance. With these elements it is possible to improve the precision of the estimators during the planning and estimation stage of a survey. This also results in a better resource allocation during the planning stage of a survey."

Participants of payment systems need access to intraday liquidity to fulfill their payment obligations. They do that either using their own funds, which are costly, or recycling incoming payment. In order to rely on incoming payments, banks could delay the settlement of their own payment obligations. From the regulators' point of view it is important to know to what degree participants rely on the payments they receive from others. In Mexico, this is among the first studies that analyze from this perspective the intraday liquidity management of the Real Time Settlement Payment System, SPEI.

When calibrated to match the business cycles properties of an average emerging market economy, the model is able to reproduce the countercyclicality of net exports and sovereign spreads and the negative correlation between investment and net exports observed in the data. Furthermore, when analyzing its behavior around sovereign default, the model successfully captures the declines in output, consumption and investment that are actually associated with these episodes."

Contracts can help smooth price variations and facilitate risk-sharing but their impact on price levels is uncertain. We simultaneously estimate the impacts of quantity supplied sold via contracts and the cash market on cash prices for grains participating in contracts: wheat, corn, soybeans and sorghum. By doing so we estimate an inverse grain demand function using supply shifters and other exogenous variables as exclusion restrictions. Our findings show that quantity supplied sold via contracts is a more important determinant of prices than quantity supplied in the cash market. A 10% increase of volume sold via contracts is estimated to reduce cash market prices by 2.5 %. Additionally, we find no evidence that more contracts affect prices by reducing quantity supplied in the cash market."

It is anticipated that the behavior of these aspects will be consistent with the process of inflation convergence to its target, in the sense that the expected inflation level and dispersion, and the probability of observing a sizable realization of inflation have been diminishing, as the cited process has taken place. Additionally, first, a model is presented in which agents face a cost when they update their inflation expectation. This model explains some of the facts seen in inflation expectation dispersion. In the model, the decrease in the dispersion is consistent with an increase in the frequency with which the agents update their inflation expectation, as observed in the data. Second, under an event-study framework the respond of upside risks of inflation expectations to the approval of the Income Law is analyzed. The results suggest that once the cited law is approved, on average there is a decrease in such risks."

In this paper we explore whether two policy instruments, namely, a capital adequacy ratio rule in combination with a Taylor rule may provide a better macroeconomic outcome than a Taylor rule alone. We conduct our analysis by appending a macroeconometric financial block to an otherwise standard semistructural small open economy neokeynesian model for policy analysis estimated for the Mexican economy.

Using a bargaining game model, I argue that the type of commodities each country produced by the end of the nineteenth Century determined the negotiation power of local governments. This led to the buildup of opposite federalist institutions in both countries, which have persisted until nowadays. The model shows that countries with regions with more autonomy to produce and trade their commodities increase the local power to collect more taxes. While in Brazil coffee was the most important commodity, Mexico relied on mining products. Coffee was produced by local landowners who became economically powerful and they were able that export taxes were collected locally with the proclamation of the 1891 Constitution. Empirical estimates show that, after 1891, exporter states increased significantly their own fiscal revenue. On the other hand, mining was capital and technology intensive, inputs that were domestically scarce in Mexico.

Thus, the agent is concerned about the intertemporal distribution of risk, which is affected by the persistence of the variables and the regimes. Regime switching allows for structural changes in the volatility of unexpected shocks. To the extent that inflationary unexpected shocks indicate lower consumption growth, nominal bond holders need to be compensated for these shocks. It follows that a switch in the regime state affecting the covariance of inflation and consumption growth can be interpreted as a change in the price of risk. I find coefficients of risk aversion from 40 to 90, and subjective discount factors above 0.99, depending on the exact specification of the model. The model yields have on average a positive slope, a consistent Principal Components decomposition, and predictability as in Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002)."

Adding these findings to the Ramsey optimal tax problem, we show it is optimal to impose higher taxes on market goods used in the production of commodities with a lower elasticity of substitution between goods and time. The reason is that government wants to minimize the distortionary substitution from market purchases toward untaxed time use in home production. This is an analog of the classical Corlett and Hague (1953-1954) result, differing in that we allow for the possibility of substitution between goods and time in the production of commodities. Leaving aside distributional considerations, we conclude that higher taxes should be imposed on market goods used in the production of 'Eating' and lower taxes imposed on market goods used in the production of 'Recreation'."

The choice of the optimal set can be interpreted as the choice among stores. Stores maximize profits and choose a quality, an assortment, and a price. A lower cost of providing quality implies higher price and higher quality. Assortment will be small for very high levels of quality. Better quality of information implies greater variety and higher price. Greater variety combined with good consumer service can be a signal for high quality of the store."

However, in emerging economies this source of information has not been thoroughly used; Mexico is not an exception. The economic stability achieved in this country in recent years has allowed the government to issue, since 2001,long-term bonds. With more stable economic cycles, the information included in the long part of the yield curve could be a useful tool to estimate future economic activity. This document analyses the predictive power of the spread. Moreover, the spread is divided into two main components to analyse the origin of its predictive power. Next, the power of the spread to forecast economic cycles is tested. Last, out-of-sample tests of the spread are carried out.

The effect on medium and long-term yields results from the increase in expected future short rates and in risk premia.

The next stage, known as charismatic autonomy (1955-1970), relied on the defense by important political figures on the central bank´s role. Sound public finances were a significant aid in this stage. The end of sound public finances signaled the termination of the central bank´s charismatic autonomy. The last stage, known as institutional autonomy (1994 to date), is certainly more robust. Apart from having contributed to preserve sound public finances, the central bank´s institutional autonomy is based on a constitutional mandate that determines the central bank´s functions, a self-governing directive body, and administrative and budget independence."

 """,2006.,Forecast Combination with Entry and Exit of Experts,"2006-08, Banco de México.",Combination of forecasts from survey data is complicated by the frequent entry and exit in real time of individual forecasters which renders conventional least squares regression approaches to estimation of the combination weights infeasible. We explore the consequences of this for a variety of forecast combination methods in common use and propose a new method that projects actual outcomes on the equal-weighted forecast as a means of adjusting for biases and noise in the underlying forecasts. Through simulations and an empirical application to inflation forecasts we show that the entry and exit of individual forecasters can have a large effect on the real time performance of conventional forecast combination methods. We also find that the proposed projection on the equal-weighted forecast works well in practice.

 """,2006.,Disagreement and Biases in Inflation Expectations,"2006-07, Banco de México.","Recent empirical work documents substantial disagreement in inflation expectations obtained from survey data. Furthermore, the extent of such disagreement varies systematically over time in a way that reflects the level and variance of current inflation. This paper offers a simple explanation for these facts based on asymmetries in the forecasters' costs of over- and under-predicting inflation. Our model implies biased forecasts with positive serial correlation in forecast errors and a cross sectional dispersion that rises with the level and the variance of the inflation rate. It also implies that biases in forecasters' ranks should be preserved over time and that forecast errors at different horizons can be predicted through the spread between the short- and long-term variance of inflation. We find empirically that these patterns are present in inflation forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters."

For this purpose, we use a non-linear VAR model that allows for regime shifts. The comparison of the different regimes identified leads to the following main findings: a) there was a major structural change in the transmission mechanism around January 2001, date that coincides with the formal adoption of the inflation targeting framework; b) after this change, fluctuations in the real exchange rate have had smaller effects on the process of price formation, the formation of inflation expectations and the nominal interest rate; c) also, there have been stronger reactions of the nominal interest rate to increases in the output gap and the rate of inflation; and d) the movements of the nominal interest rate have a more effective influence on the real exchange rate and the rate of inflation."

In particular, we derive the order in probability of the t-statistic in a linear regression equation under a variety of empirically relevant data generation processes, and show that the spurious regression phenomenon is present in all cases considered, when at least one of the variables behaves in a nonstationary way. Simulation experiments confirm our asymptotic results."

The models applied are univariate GARCH, a multi-variate GARCH (the BEKK model), option implied volatilities, and a composite forecast model. The composite specification includes time-series (ARCH-type) and option implied volatility forecasts. Different to most of the literature, this paper includes a statistical evaluation of the forecast accuracy of a composite model and models that are not combined. The results show that the composite volatility forecasts are superior to the other models in terms of mean squared errors (MSE). In forecast evaluations of the MSE it was found that estimates were statistically significantly different between composite forecast estimates and its counterparts. According to these results conclusions are as follows: the composite model is superior and both type of data -historical and implied in option prices- must be used when available."

This study looks at the consequence of such changes on the aggregate productivity of the formal sector. This work uses the data set of wages and number of workers from the Mexican Social Security Institute (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social). The results suggest that changes in the composition of the formal employment in Mexico did not significatively affect the average workers productivity in the formal sector. Given the relevance of the informal sector in Mexico and that in the last five years the formal employment has grown at lower rates than the economically active population, it is suggested that further analysis on this subject should consider informal employment as well."

This paper studies the effect of political uncertainty on sovereign default and interest rate spreads in emerging markets. The paper develops a quantitative model of sovereign debt and default under political uncertainty in a small open economy that captures some of the main empirical regularities in emerging economies: default occurs in equilibrium and interest rate spreads and default risk are countercyclical. Consistent with empirical evidence, the quantitative analysis shows that higher levels of political uncertainty significantly raise the default frequency and both the level and volatility of the spreads."

The model predicts that default incentives and default premia are higher in recessions, as observed in the data. In a quantitative exercise, the model matches various features of emerging economies and can account for the dynamics of default episodes in these markets."

The paper then develops the implications of the differences between factor shares obtained from the NIPA data and the household survey data for some areas of economic research, including growth accounting and the analysis of the sources of growth."

How do financial fragility and the costs of banking crises evolve with the level of wealth of countries? We analyze these issues using an overlapping generations growth model where agents experience idiosyncratic liquidity shocks. By pooling liquidity risk, banks play a growth-enhancing role in reducing inefficient liquidation of long term projects, but they may face liquidity crises associated with severe output losses. We show that middle-income economies may find it optimal to be exposed to liquidity crises, while poor and rich economies have more incentives to develop a fully covered banking system. Therefore, middle-income economies could experience banking crises in the process of their development and, as they get richer, they eventually converge to a financially safe, long-run steady state."

 """,2005.,Wealth Financial Intermediation and Growth,"2005-02, Banco de México.","This paper presents empirical support for the existence non-linear effects in the contribution of financial intermediation to economic growth, and offers a theoretical explanation for these effects. We show that the exogenous contribution of financial development to economic growth has different effects for different levels of income per capita. We find that this contribution is generally increasing with the level of income per capita of the economy, up to a relatively high level of income. This contribution is consistently lower for poor countries, and for some low levels of income per capita it can be negative. We provide a growth model of financial intermediation to account for these wealth effects. We show that at early stages of economic development, a bank can increase the welfare of its depositors only at the cost of lowering investment and growth. However, once the economy has crossed a certain wealth threshold, the liquidity role of banks becomes unambiguously growth enhancing. However, for high levels of wealth, growth generated by financial intermediation declines as the economy attains the optimal level of consumption risk sharing."

The purpose is to show that, once an economy establishes a sustainable fiscal position, an inflation targeting framework can be seen as an efficient mechanism to impose discipline on monetary policy and, thus, to reduce inflation. This paper describes the measures that were taken after the 1995 crisis to stabilize the economy and that prevented the possibility of a fiscal dominance situation from arising. Consequently, the role of monetary policy in reducing inflation is analyzed, in particular its response to different inflationary shocks. Results show that in conducting the successful disinflationary process, Banco de México's responses to inflationary shocks have been consistent with inflation targeting principles."

I exploit the regional variation in the exposure to globalization to identify the effects of NAFTA on wages and on returns to schooling. The results support the presence of Stolper-Samuelson type of responses during Mexico's globalization process: regions more exposed to international markets appear to have exhibited an increase in wage levels, but a decrease in returns to schooling, relative to other regions of the country. The results suggest that globalization has an important spatial dimension that is usually neglected in traditional trade models."

This suggests that the positive effect of bilateral trade on business cycle synchronization found in previous studies for the case of industrial countries may also hold for industrial and less developed country pairs. The recent entry of other unskilled labor-abundant countries into global trade, however, seems to be affecting Mexico's competitiveness in some industries and causing Mexico to be losing market share in the U.S. import market. As a consequence, this event could lead to a permanent negative shift in Mexico's manufacturing output levels, relative to the U.S., and could possibly weaken the degree of business cycle synchronization between these countries. A related effect is shown to be that, in some industries where strong Mexico-U.S. production-sharing links persist, overall North American output is apparently being affected by the global movement of these activities towards the Asian block."

In the empirical section, cointegration techniques and error correction models are used. The sample considers quarterly data from the first quarter of 1980 to the third quarter of 2002. According to these models, private investment depends positively on output, and negatively on the real exchange rate and public investment. Forecasts are presented in terms of both point estimates and confidence intervals. In most cases, the confidence band around the forecast includes the observed value of the forecasted variable."

This positive contribution takes place not only by its effect on commercial flows but also because these agreements can improve the property rights enforcement. In this context, we propose the hypothesis that multilateral free trade agreements have a greater impact on the flow of FDI to countries with a poor enforcement of property rights. When these agreements include a chapter on dispute settlements with an arbitrage panel, they help to mitigate some deficiencies of the national institutions by allowing some conflicts to be solved in a panel of international members. The empirical results using a panel of 38 countries from 1980 to 2001 and including 203 agreements corroborate the proposed theory."

The latter methodology is also used to propose a definition of exchange rate risk premium, which compensates investors for the peso-depreciation bias and the higher probability of extreme variations that is observed in the estimated risk-neutral probability functions."
