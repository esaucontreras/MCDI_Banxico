 """,2025.,The Anatomy of Aggregate Productivity,"1050, Central Bank of Chile.","We present an aggregation result that structurally dissects the drivers of aggregate productivity, i.e., technology and the reallocation of resources, across arbitrary parts of the economy using sufficient statistics that can be measured with standard datasets. Besides the typical statistics of factor shares and distortion changes, consumption share changes emerge as a new sufficient statistics that capture an income redistribution channel between households. This channel reflects how changes in households’ income propagate upstream, influencing the allocation of resources across firms. We apply our results to revisit Chile’s aggregate productivity stagnation since 2010, leveraging two decades of administrative firm-to-firm data. This stagnation is almost entirely driven by the reallocation of resources. Exports of mining, domestic output of manufacturing and retail, and incumbent large firms shape the bulk of this stagnation."

 """,2025.,The Aggregate Welfare Effects of Nonlinear Prices in Supply Chains,"1049, Central Bank of Chile.","We study how nonlinear pricing in supply chains shapes output, firm entry, and aggregate welfare. We develop a general equilibrium model in which firms both charge and pay nonlinear prices along the supply chain. Relative to linear pricing, nonlinear prices increase firm-level output but reduce firm entry by distorting the distribution of profits, yielding ambiguous welfare effects. Using transaction-level data from Chilean firms, we document robust evidence consistent with widespread nonlinear pricing across buyer groups. Calibrating the model to the data, we find that nonlinear pricing raises production but deters entry. In equilibrium, output gains dominate: aggregate welfare losses from market power are approximately 18% lower under nonlinear prices than under linear pricing, indicating that analyses based on linear pricing overstate the welfare costs of market power."

 """,2025.,The effect of automation on the labor market: An approach using firm-level microdata,"1048, Central Bank of Chile.","This study analyzes the relationship between machines and employment across different workers' income quintiles, utilizing firm-level and worker-level microdata for Chile from 2009 to 2023, considering a total of 80,000 firms and 2,900,000 workers. To investigate this dynamic, a panel regression is used, modeling employment as a function of machines and a set of other covariates. Additionally, a generalized propensity score is used to address the endogeneity problem. The results indicate that the relationship between machines and employment is predominantly negative, especially for workers in the middle-income quintiles and for certain economic sectors such as business services, transport, and information & communication. Furthermore, the results suggest that the relationship between machines and employment in high-income quintiles has been positive, supporting the idea that technological development requires highly qualified workers. Overall, the results suggest that automation has had heterogeneous effects on employment in the Chilean labor market, and these effects are smaller than those suggested by the literature."

 """,2025.,Firm-level CO2 Emissions and Production Networks: Evidence from Administrative Data in Chile,"1047, Central Bank of Chile.","This project uses unique Chilean administrative data to shed light on how production networks might play a key role in shaping the macroeconomic impacts of green transition policies. First, using customs and firm-to-firm transaction data that covers the universe of firms in Chile, we build the fossil fuel consumption and the direct CO2 emissions at the firm, sectoral, and aggregate levels. In line with the official national sources, the electricity generation sector is the most important contributor to aggregate CO2 emissions, followed by the manufacturing, transport, and mining sectors. Then, we study the role of input-output linkages in propagating CO2 emissions to the rest of the economy. To do so, we construct the production network and the carbon footprint at the firm level using firm-to-firm transaction data from the Chilean IRS, and we validate our results with the input-output tables approach used in the literature. The results show that the electricity generation sector is central in the network, with potentially important downstream spillover effects, while the mining sector is located in the outer part of the network with rich upstream connections. Also, we show that the copper mining industry is the most exposed one to a carbon tax scheme implemented on all the firms in the economy and also to one that only targets the electricity generation sector."

 """,2025.,The Cross Border Effects of Bank Capital Regulation in General Equilibrium,"1046, Central Bank of Chile.","We examine the cross-border effects of bank capital requirements using a two-country DSGE model with financial frictions, calibrated to match Euro Area banking flows. Regulation follows a host country principle, applying uniformly to all bank exposures within a country, regardless of the banks' nationality. We find that increasing capital requirements in one country leads to a short run credit contraction in interconnected countries. However, long run credit spillovers are negligible. Instead, we find positive long run welfare spillovers, primarily due to higher bank dividend payouts to foreign bank owners, rather than increased financial stability in the foreign country."

 """,2025.,The impact of financial crises on industrial growth in the Middle East and North Africa,"1045, Central Bank of Chile.","Using country-industry panel data between 1980 until 2019, I estimate the causal effects of financial crises, with total impact given by the sum of a direct effect on all industries and an external finance dependence channel. Currency crises have the worst impact of all types of crises across all countries. Financial crises of all types are substantially worse for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economies. For MENA, there is a manufacturing growth reduction of 2.8%, 6% and 1.2% during banking, currency and sovereign debt crises. There is substantial heterogeneity across the MENA, with Morocco, Iraq and Israel experiencing a much stronger impact from all types of financial crises."

 """,2025.,The impact of financial crises on industrial growth: lessons from the last 40 years,"1044, Central Bank of Chile.","This work shows the impact of financial crises across industries and the total manufacturing sector. I find both a direct impact of financial crises on all manufacturing growth and an additional effect through an external finance dependence channel. Externally dependent industries experience lower growth during banking and currency crises, especially in emerging markets and developing economies. Banking, currency and sovereign debt crises cause an average reduction in total manufacturing growth of 2.7%, 6% and 1%, respectively, with the direct effect being the most significant component. Finally, I show that macroprudential policies adopted after the Great Financial Crisis attenuated the fall in growth caused by banking crises."

 """,2025.,Heterogeneous UIPDs Across Firms: Spillovers from U.S. Monetary Policy Shocks,"1043, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper investigates the granular transmission of U.S. monetary policy shocks to deviations from the uncovered interest rate parity (UIPDs) in emerging economies. Using a comprehensive dataset from Chile that accounts for firm-bank relationships and the time-variant characteristics of both firms and banks, we uncover several key findings: (1) Shocks to the federal funds rate (FFR) increase banks’ costs of foreign borrowing. (2) These higher credit costs disproportionately affect small firms, raising their UIPDs more than for large firms. (3) This size-differentiated impact stems from the relatively higher interest rates on domestic currency loans faced by small firms. (4) In contrast, interest rates on dollar-denominated loans respond homogeneously across all firms. (5) We find no differential effect on loan quantities, suggesting an active role of credit supply and demand. We rationalize these findings with a small open economy model of corporate default that incorporates heterogeneous firms borrowing from domestic banks in both foreign and domestic currencies. In our model, a higher FFR reduces the marginal cost of defaulting on domestic-currency debt for small firms more than for large firms."

 """,2025.,Bank Competition and Investment Costs across Space,"1042, Central Bank of Chile.","Using detailed loan-level data from Chile, we document significant geographic differences in interest rates for firm loans. Firms in cities with high borrowing costs pay around 280 basis points more than firms in low-cost cities. While these estimates account for differences in firm and loan characteristics across cities, we find evidence that they are related to the level of concentration in the local loan market. We examine the pass-through of monetary policy to lending rates and find that banks with higher local market shares exhibit stronger pass-through, aligning with oligopolistic models of branch competition."

 """,2025.,Tail-Risk Indicators with Time-Variant Volatility Models: the case of the Chilean Peso,"1041, Central Bank of Chile.","In this paper we propose a framework for building tail-risk indicators for the Chilean Peso (CLP) based on time-variant volatility models [e.g., Engle (1982), Taylor (1982), Nelson (1991), Heston and Nandi (2000)], which we estimate by combining: (i) daily returns, (ii) option-implied volatility (IV), and (iii) intraday realized volatility (RV). Our empirical results show that the in-sample fit of the models improves when volatility measures (IV or RV) are added. We provide an application of the framework to evaluate extreme scenarios."

 """,2025.,Exposición de la Banca en Chile a los Riesgos Financieros relacionados al Clima: Riesgos Físicos y de Transición,"1040, Central Bank of Chile.","This study shows evidence of the levels of exposure to physical and transition climate risks of the commercial portfolio of Chilean banks. Regarding physical risk, we find that the exposure of commercial loans to economic sectors that are intensive in natural resources is 11%. Using the chain of impact, the most relevant risks manifest in 3% of the portfolio, with a high dispersion between banks. Regarding transition risks, we analyzed the exposure to sudden increases in the carbon tax, changing it from USD 5 to USD 75. We found that 20% of the commercial portfolio is exposed to this risk. However, only 4,9% face a higher risk due to the representativeness of this tax increase either in the company's residual debt or sales level. At a systemic level, we find that 27% of the portfolio is exposed to some degree of climate risk, and 7% is at a high-risk level."

 """,2025.,The Effects of Educated Leaders on Policy and Politics: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Brazil,"1039, Central Bank of Chile.","We examine whether and how the educational background of political leaders matters for policy choices and outcomes. Using data on municipalities in Brazil from 2000–2008, we estimate the effects of electing a more educated leader in a regression-discontinuity design whereby policy inputs and outcomes in municipalities where a highly educated candidate barely won the election are compared with those of municipalities where a highly educated candidate barely lost. Our results indicate that highly educated mayors make different choices regarding the allocation of public funds and inputs in critical sectors when compared to non-highly educated mayors, yet they do not produce better indicators on a variety of measurable outcomes. Furthermore, our estimates suggest a negative impact of educated mayors on local economic growth and children’s health. We additionally document the existence of heterogeneity in the effects of highly educated leaders along political ideology and age of the candidate. Lastly, highly educated leaders are not more likely to be reelected, suggesting that they are not perceived as better politicians."

 """,2025.,Equilibrium Consequences of Vouchers Under Simultaneous Extensive and Intensive Margins Competition,"1038, Central Bank of Chile.","I develop an empirical model to study the consequences of educational vouchers on markets’ equilibria. Unlike most related papers, I model both extensive and intensive margins of action for schools. I apply my model to Chile’s primary education, an industry that heavily subsidizes private schools through the use of vouchers. Results show that a correct understanding of the equilibrium consequences of vouchers necessitates accounting for both extensive (program participation) and intensive (fees) margins. I also find that the actual voucher program targeted to vulnerable students attracts mostly low-quality schools to serve low-income families. Alternative policy designs are proposed and tested."

 """,2025.,Dinámicas del Mercado Laboral Formal en Chile: Evidencia desde los Microdatos,"1037, Central Bank of Chile.","Access to administrative records has gained relevance in monitoring key economic indicators, offering a more precise and systematic alternative to surveys. This study analyzes the formal labor market in Chile between 2015 and 2023 using data from the Unemployment Insurance, the Pension System, and the Labor Directorate. It examines the creation, destruction, change, and maintenance of employment, with a focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show significant effects in sectors such as commerce and construction during the crisis, followed by a recovery in 2021. Differences in labor flows are observed according to gender, education, age, type of contract, and economic sector, with higher turnover among young women with lower educational levels. Additionally, fluctuations in real wages are identified, with a decline during the pandemic and a recovery from the end of 2022. While these data offer valuable insights, their limitation in capturing informal or self-employment should be considered when interpreting the state of the labor market."

 """,2025.,Micro-Evidence on the Consumption Impact of Income-Support Policies During COVID-19,"1036, Central Bank of Chile.","Income-support policies can boost consumption during a catastrophic episode like the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data on Chilean municipalities, we investigate the impact on private consumption of income-support policies, such as lump-sum trans-fers and withdrawals of funds from the contributors’ mandatory pension accounts. We find that both emergency income and pension withdrawals had statistically sig-nificant effects with an estimated average marginal propensity to consume of about 20 percent. Consumption of durable goods is more sensitive to these policies than other goods, especially in the programs’ initial stages. Higher educational attainment and financial leverage, proxying better access to bank credit, are associated with weaker consumption reaction across municipalities."

 """,2025.,The Incidence of Distortions,"1026, Central Bank of Chile.","Economic distortions—such as market power, taxes, credit constraints, etc.— are fundamental in understanding income differences across countries. Recent work has documented the pervasive extent of economic distortions and how they lead to sub-stantial aggregate productivity loss. Far less well understood is how these phenomena affect members of society differently. In this paper we combine unique datasets from Chile, linking workers and owners to firms, firms to each other, firms to consumers, and firms and consumers to the government, in order to quantify the incidence of distortions for the first time."

 """,2025.,Macro Implications of Inequality-driven Political Polarization,"1011, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper builds a model of heterogenous agents, incomplete markets and idiosyncratic shocks extended with a political mechanism that allows for realistic party competition. Higher inequality leads to more disperse policy preferences, to which parties respond endogenously distancing themselves from median voter preferences. The polarization of party proposals leads to greater uncertainty before elections, as well as greater policy switches after them, with significant macroeconomic effects. Results are in line with previous empirical evidence linking inequality, polarization and macroeconomic performance. The model is solved introducing political quasi-aggregation, and can be extended to analyze different economic policies and alternative political institutions."

 """,2025.,Input Price Dispersion Across Buyers: New Evidence and Implications for Aggregate Productivity,"1006, Central Bank of Chile.","We use a comprehensive dataset of electronic invoices from Chilean firms to doc-ument new facts on price dispersion across buyers of the same intermediate good. More than half of manufacturing sales involve products purchased by multiple buy-ers within the same month, and price dispersion is pervasive. On average, the price range across buyers for the same product is 46 percentage points. These price differences are highly persistent over time and strongly correlated across different products purchased by the same firm. While price gaps across buyers comove with observable buyerseller characteristics—such as buyer size and transaction volume—these factors explain only a small portion of the observed price differences. Geographic distance and payment method (cash vs. credit) have little explanatory power, suggesting that price gaps reflect markup differences rather than variation in marginal costs. Guided by our data, we use a production network model to quantify the aggregate efficiency gains from eliminating markup dispersion in the sales of manufactured intermediate inputs. Buyer-level markup differences account for 30 to 60 percent of the total productivity gains achievable by equalizing markups across both products and buyers."

Using Chilean customs data, we document a sharp, heteroge-neous increase in freight costs during 2019–2021. Exploiting differential expo-sure of importers to origins, we construct a shift-share instrument for import prices. Using this instrument, we estimate an elasticity of substitution among import origins of intermediate goods of 4.38. Incorporating this estimate into a general equilibrium model with nominal rigidities, we calculate that the observed increase in freight costs accounts for 13.3 percent of the inflation rate recorded in the 2019q4-2021q4 period."

 """,2025.,"Production Network Formation, Trade, and Welfare","971, Central Bank of Chile.","We study the aggregate implications of production network formation in a quantitative multi-location general equilibrium trade model. Firms search for suppliers and buyers across locations subject to matching frictions, generating a gravity struc-ture of production networks. We develop suficient statistics for global and regional welfare and characterize the deviations from the fixed network environment, including the role of ineficiency and amplification effects of search and matching. We calibrate our multi-sector model to Chilean domestic and international firm-to-firm trade data and show that our model can rationalize the observed increase in domestic supplier linkages after Chile’s recent trade agreements. Abstracting from endogenous networks reduces Chile’s aggregate welfare losses by 20 percent when import costs are raised to their pre-agreement levels, consistent with inefficiently low equilibrium levels of search. Fixing the trade elasticity, the welfare gains from trade relative to municipality autarky drop by 40 percent due to amplification effects of search."

Our regression discontinuity design reveals that eligible firms increased domestic borrowing at lower costs. These policies reduced the cost of domestic debt compared to foreign debt, easing access to capital. An open economy model explains the complementarity of both interventions–credit lines and guarantees–in relaxing collateral constraints, reducing financial intermediaries’ risk aversion and boosting domestic credit supply amidst shrinking international flows."

 """,2024.,"Crisis Credit, Employment Protection, Indebtedness, and Risk","1035, Central Bank of Chile.","We study how credit guarantee and employment protection programs interact by assisting firms during crisis times. In particular, we analyze how these government programs influence credit allocation, indebtedness, and risk at both micro and macro levels. The programs provide different incentives for firms. The low interest rate encourages riskier firms to demand government-backed credit, while banks tend to reject those credit applications. The credit demand outweighs this screening supply response, expanding micro-level indebtedness across the extensive and intensive margins among riskier firms. The uptake of the employment program is not associated with risk, as firms internalize the opportunity cost of reduced operations when sending workers home to qualify for assistance. The employment program mitigates the indebtedness expansion of the credit program by supporting firms and enabling banks to better screen firms. The macroeconomic risk of the credit program would increase by a third without the availability of the employment program."

First, I extend the Marx and Schummer (2021) model to multi-sided markets and show that its main result holds: the allocation of the price level across the sides of the market is not affected by the size imbalance across these sides. I then use preference simulations to address the price level problem in two-sided markets. I find that the optimal price level depends positively on: (i) the size of the market when it is balanced; and (ii) the imbalance of the market when it is unbalanced. The simulations also yield important implications for the relationship between the percentage of unmatched agents and market size and imbalance."

 """,2024.,Financiamiento de corto plazo de las empresas chilenas,"1032, Central Bank of Chile.","Our study, which takes a novel approach by using administrative data from Chilean firms financed mainly by local banks in the Manufacturing and Commerce sectors, has uncovered significant findings. Between 2009 and 2019, we observed a quarterly change in bank debt that demonstrates a positive relationship with the change in sales and a negative relationship with the operating margin. This debt behavior is a direct response to the increased need for working capital financing when a firm experiences a surge in sales, and a decreased need for debt financing when the business margin is more substantial. This is a crucial first step in understanding the determinants of short-term financing decisions of Chilean firms financed mainly with banks, an area that has been relatively understudied in our country. Moving forward, it will be intriguing to delve into the implications of the massive delivery of Fogape-Covid credits starting in 2020. Initial data suggests a shift in the relationship between debt, sales, and margins, as the increase in financing was primarily concentrated in those companies experiencing a decline in sales."

 """,2024.,International Trade Finance and Learning Dynamics,"1031, Central Bank of Chile.","We study how trade finance and long-term relationships between exporters and importers facilitate international trade by allowing exporters to learn about demand uncertainty and counterparty risk. Using detailed micro-level Chilean data, we document that new exporters are more likely to use cash-in-advance (CIA) arrangements and gradually switch to providing trade credit as they continue to export. These dynamics affect export growth and are more salient for firms with less exporting experience and selling to riskier destinations. We set up an international trade model in which firms make exporting and trade financing decisions subject to demand and counterparty risks and estimate it using microdata. We then use the model to quantify the relative importance of demand and counterparty risks and investigate how trade finance choices and learning affect the dynamics of exports. Our model implies that the response of aggregate exports and the number of exporters to shocks to aggregate interest rates can overshoot in the short run if long-term relationships and relationship-specific knowledge are destroyed. Building relationships takes time, making the response to these shocks sluggish and persistent. Crucially, these responses depend on the riskiness of trade destinations."

We match an administrative register of all the real estate properties’ transactions in Chile between 2002 and 2020 with a high spatial resolution dataset of local temperatures and precipitation. Even after controlling for a wide set of home characteristics or fixed-effects for each property, we find that fluctuations in temperatures had an impact on the prices of residential homes and agricultural properties."

 """,2024.,Una mirada a la evidencia internacional en la emisión de bonos digitales,"1029, Central Bank of Chile.","This document investigates the activity in the issuance of tokenized bonds, its conditions, and implications. The issuance of digital bonds is part of different public-private initiatives aimed at exploring the benefits and challenges of tokenization for the financial system. Although tokenization is still in an incipient stage, more recently, these initiatives have gained greater dynamism. The evolution of technology is implying a profound transformation of the financial system, not only for end users, but also payment systems and their infrastructures, redefining financial intermediation processes and the role of intermediaries. The issuance of digital bonds is framed in this context. Tokenization offers the potential for significant efficiency gains, through cost reduction and process acceleration, as well as reducing the risks present in current infrastructures. Experimental results confirm this potential. However, scaled adoption of tokenization raises several challenges and policy implications. The concentration of digital bond issuances in areas with greater legal and regulatory developments highlights the importance of achieving an adequate balance between promoting financial innovation and ensuring market integrity, financial stability, and investor protection. Interoperability emerges as a crucial factor to be addressed to avoid the risk of market fragmentation. Equally relevant will be providing a means of secure settlement."

This paper explores the prevalence, determinants, and dynamics of labour informality in Peru, considering the extensive margin, where unregistered firms hire unregistered workers, and the intensive margin, in which, even when firms are registered with tax authorities, hire employees off the books. Exploiting a rich household survey (ENAHO) between 2007 and 2019, the paper identifies key determinants of informality, such as gender, age, experience and education. Furthermore, the paper analyses transitions into and out of labour informality and the factors influencing these transitions over time. The findings suggest that labour and firm informality are influenced by both structural economic conditions and individual characteristics. Finally, the paper explores the linkages between workers’ transitions and subsequent changes in their labour income. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of informal employment in Peru, with lessons for Latin America, offering insights for policymakers aiming to enhance labour market formalisation and social protection."

 """,2024.,Navigating trade uncertainty: The role of trade financing and the spillover effects,"1027, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper exploits the exogenous changes of destination/origin-specific trade uncertainty (TU) to investigate the direct and spillover effects of TU on firms' foreign-trade operations and credit outcomes. Using transaction-level data of Chilean firms and banks, we first show that increasing TU dampens export growth through a deterioration of firms' working capital. This is especially true when exports are mainly financed by cash-in-advance, a payment mode that entails shorter and less permanent relationships between firms. Second, we find that increases in TU induce a bank-firm portfolio redistribution away from small firms toward large importers and firms involved in the global value chain (GVC). Our results are consistent with a risk-mitigating channel from banks that grant larger loans to firms that are perceived as relatively less risky during periods of high trade tensions. This way, TU shocks spill over to other firms not initially affected by TU through the bank credit market."

The model provides micro-foundations for a nonlinear Phillips curve: the sensitivity of inflation to activity increases after large shocks due to an endogenous rise in the frequency of price changes, as observed during the recent inflation surge. In response to large costpush shocks, optimal policy leverages the lower sacrifice ratio to reduce inflation and stabilize the frequency of price adjustments. When facing total factor productivity shocks, an efficient disturbance, the optimal policy commits to strict price stability, similar to the prescription in the standard Calvo (1983) model."

Monetary policy optimally focuses on aggregate stabilization, but deviates from a zero-inflation target; in a model calibration to the U.S., however, it effectively approximates a zero-inflation target. Because monetary policy is a blunt instrument and government spending trades off stabilization against the optimal-level public good provision, the first best is not achieved."

 """,2024.,Modelling high frequency non-financial big time series with an application to jobless claims in Chile,"1023, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper explores the challenges of modelling high-frequency, non-financial big data time-series. Focusing on daily, hourly, and even minute-level data, the study in-vestigates the presence of various seasonalities (daily, weekly, monthly, and annual) and how these cycles might interrelate between them and be influenced by weather patterns and calendar variations. By analyzing these cyclical characteristics and data responses to external factors, the paper explores the potential for regimeswitching, dynamic, and non-linear models to capture these complexities. Furthermore, it proposes the use of Autometrics –an automated algorithm for identifying parsimonious models– to jointly account for all the data’s peculiarities. The resulting models, beyond structural anal-ysis and forecasting, are useful for constructing real-time quantitative macroeconomic leading indicators, demand planning and dynamic pricing strategies in various sectors that are sensitive to the factors identified in the analysis (e.g., of utilities, retail stores, traffic, or labor market indicators). The paper includes an application to the daily series of jobless claims in Chile."

Using administrative data on product transactions between all the for-mal Chilean firms, we provide evidence that demand shocks to one product affect the production of other products within the same firm, suggesting firms engage in joint production. We develop a framework to measure resource misallocation in production networks with joint production, deriving non-parametric sufficient statistics to quantify these effects. Applying the framework to Chile, we find that reallocation effects, considering joint production, explain 86% of observed aggregate TFP growth for the 2016-2022 period. Ignoring joint production leads to overestimating resource misallocation."

The indicators are based on the liquidity and contagion risk concentrated in each participant. During the 10 years of the sample (2012-2022), the importance of each participant has changed, highlighting the evolution of merged banks and some smaller ones. In terms of liquidity provision, there are important participants of the network that are not systemic based on alternative metrics, such as size of total assets. Finally, the document concludes that the 2022 payment network is more resilient than 2012 to individual liquidity shocks, since both indicators decrease their concentration, spreading among more participants. This document contributes to the monitoring of the risks present in the local RTGS system, presenting a methodology to calculate the degree of importance of each participant of the payment network."

Using a proprietary database, we analyse if porfolio asset reallocations in the Chilean pension fund industry act as a mechanism for exerting and enhanced volatility in the nominal exchange rate surrounding pension fund transactions initiated by pension pressures in the Chilean peso FOREX market. We document significant price pressure and enhanced volatility investors following financial advisory firm recommendations. We provide evidence that certain institutions participating in the FOREX market may seek to exploit the anticipated portfolio adjustments following such recommendations by front-running pension fund trades. The potential for financial asset market volatility and market instability this activity creates has regulatory and policy implications."

 """,2024.,"Through Drought and Flood: the past, present and future of Climate Migration","1019, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper studies emigration pressures associated with climate change and sheds light on how they could evolve as climate degrades further. We start with a narrative approach focusing on four historical events. We document that severe climate disruption led to significant outward migration in the past, driven by social conflict, violence, and, in some cases, societal collapse. Then, we turn the analysis to the present. Using a regression panel approach for 154 countries between 1990 and 2020, we find a highly significant and nonlinear relationship between climate change and migration, with a U shape around a “temperature optimum.” The nonlinearity is stronger in poorer countries. Indeed, despite tropical climatic zones having experienced the smallest increase in temperature thus far, they exhibit the largest increase in outward migration due to their higher initial temperature and lower GDP per capita (limiting adaptation). Finally, we use the estimated model to project future migration under five IPCC scenarios and for a tipping point scenario (AMOC collapse). We find moderate effects on migration increase under moderate climate scenarios, but that migration would double for tropical areas in the most extreme scenario. In the AMOC collapse scenario, where regions close to the poles will freeze, we find much larger effects, with total outward migration being driven by cold and temperate climate countries. We conjecture that our results constitute a lower bound of the possible effects, given (i) the non-well-captured nonlinearities and (ii) the potential fall in income due to climate damages that limit adaptation."

 """,2024.,Supply Chain Uncertainty and Diversification,"1018, Central Bank of Chile.","Supply chain uncertainty is becoming increasingly frequent, generating unpredictability for firms that need to source inputs to produce. We aim to understand how this uncertainty affects firms’ sourcing decisions. To answer this, and following Antràs et al.(2017), we write a multi-country sourcing model where firms’ self-select into importing based on productivity, cost minimization, and trade uncertainty that can alter the cost of importing. Our findings reveal that, even in the presence of aggregate or idiosyncratic uncertainty, a pecking order emerges, with larger firms self-selecting into importing from a more extensive set of suppliers. Despite the quantitative significance of marginal cost reduction as the primary driver of firms’ sourcing decisions, risk introduces a nuanced dimension. Firm-specific risk introduces a positive option value associated with diversifying the set of suppliers. Meanwhile, aggregate uncertainty has a theoretically ambiguous impact, since it also affects the market demand. In our structural analysis, we estimate both aggregate and idiosyncratic uncertainty and fixed costs of sourcing using firm-level data from Chile. We then obtain a counterfactual using the change in aggregate uncertainty from 2020 to 2023 and find a positive relationship between the change in uncertainty and the change in both intensive and extensive margins. This research contributes to under-standing how firms navigate supply chain risk and make strategic sourcing decisions in the face of uncertainty."

This paper studies how forecasts of inflation and output growth respond to unexpected policy rate decisions using datasets for Brazil and Chile that satisfy three conditions: high enough frequency, short-term horizons, and the same source for the dependent and independent variables. The results show that inflation and output forecasts increase in the short run after an unexpected increase in the policy rate, which supports the existence of an information shock behind the monetary policy decision. These results can be explained by a baseline Neo-Keynesian model only when the interest rate provides information about shocks other than the monetary policy shock."

It has been well documented that participation rates in investment in risky assets are substantially smaller than the ones predicted in standard models of portfolio choice. Also, both participation rates and risky shares are highly increasing in wealth. However, both features are usually absent in workhorse models of wealth accumulation. We introduce portfolio choice and adjustment frictions into an otherwise standard model of household saving behavior. Calibrating it to U.S. household-level data, we show that the model is able to provide a better fit of the wealth distribution while being consistent with well-known facts of households’ portfolio choices. In particular, the model explains roughly half of the gap between top wealth shares predicted by traditional models of wealth accumulation (e.g. Aiyagari, 1994) and the data."

We show that: (1) when natural capital is abundant, it is optimal to deplete some and conserve some, but less depletion should occur if there is a critical threshold beyond which Nature is irreversibly altered; (2) subsidizing the conservation of Nature makes long-run growth stronger and more sustainable in Nature-rich and Nature-poor countries alike, but implies lower consumption globally in the short run."

In turn, these wage premia are persistent in the informal sector, unlike the formal one. While these wage gains appear to increase around 20% the probability of layoffs when compared to the unconditional means across both sectors, the absolute increase for informal workers can be up to six-fold larger relative to their formal counterparts. The absence of regulation and employee benefits -such as written contracts, severance payments and social insurance-seems to have an amplifying effect on the informal workers’ bargaining power during the most favourable periods of the labour market."

Our results suggest that the pass-through of changes in firm sales on the wages of continuing workers can be significant, especially for large negative shocks, and that the effects vary significantly with labor market conditions. We show that responses along the extensive margin of employment also play a relevant role, as workers can face a significant risk of displacement. Our findings suggest that considering the earnings of workers who leave the firm after a negative shock provides a more precise assessment of how firms transfer risks to workers since displacement can have relevant implications."

In this paper, I show that these outcomes crucially depend on whether importing firms are matched with multinational suppliers or with single-country suppliers. I study an antidumping duty imposed by Colombia on the imports of Chinese truck tires. I observe the full network of Colombian importers and their foreign suppliers. More importantly, plant location data shows that a few suppliers engage in multinational production, while most suppliers produce in only one country. Due to the policy, approximately 75% of Chinese tire imports were replaced with those from other origins, predominantly involving multinational suppliers in a diverse array of interactions. I estimate a quantitative trade framework to match the reallocation and price changes in the data. The model isolates three distinct channels of reallocation, influenced by connections with multinational suppliers and other complex market dynamics. This nuanced approach reveals that traditional reduced-form strategies to quantify reallocation may overlook these channels, potentially skewing welfare effect predictions of tariff -and similar- shocks."

The empirical analysis supports these mechanisms, specially for developed economies. For emerging economies, both relationships are weaker, consistent with more pervasive currency stabilization policies that mute the FX response at the expense of higher volatility in longer yields.

More productive and larger firms have closer relationships with banks. We build a dynamic model of firm behavior where firms choose their relationship status jointly with investment and borrowing decisions. Calibrating the model to Chilean data, we find that borrowing in relationships allows for greater screening and monitoring of firms, provides implicit guarantees to other creditors and necessitates a lower amount of collateral. More productive firms select into relationships, and relationship lending allows for larger loans at lower interest rates. Counterfactual experiments indicate that the effects of relationship lending are large.

In this period importers faced a short-lived increase in imported input costs. In 2021 imports rebound strongly. While exporter firms (excluding mining) kept their export activity as well as their selling price stable.

Exploiting quasi-experimental variation in the exposure of firms to these incidents, we find that more exposed firms experience larger declines in sales, larger employment losses, and are more likely to fall behind in their financial obligations than less affected firms. Moreover, these responses are significantly stronger for those firms more likely to be financially constrained.

Using data with daily and intra-daily frequency for the nominal exchange rate, results show through different empirical methods that both intervention episodes have significant effects in the expected direction on the level and volatility of the exchange rate. The effects associated with the 2019 and 2022 interventions are appreciations of an average of 2% and 6%, respectively. The estimated decrease in volatility is also greater in the 2022 intervention. The results support the implications of the different mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature to understand the effectiveness of FXI.

We show that a model with two sectors, two groups of workers, and limited access to financial markets in which the government buys more proportionally from the skilled intensive sector can account for these empirical facts. As a consequence of the inequality government purchases generates, the government spending multiplier is between 16 and 22 percent lower than when the government spends exclusively on the unskilled intensive sector. The reason for this is that government spending delivers disproportionately more income to skilled workers, who have a low marginal propensity to consume. Therefore, the way government spends matters both for inequality and for the effectiveness of government spending in stimulating the economy."

The longer the horizon, the larger the role is played by bilateral ER movements, which lends support to producer currency pricing. The dynamics do not depend on the invoicing currency.

When the Fed’s rate was at the ZLB (2008-2015), data for several SOE show a significantly lower correlation between interest rates and inflation, which is at odds with the empirical regularity. This is explained in a model where the distribution of shocks that affect SOE changes when the international interest rate hits the ZLB. Two opposing channels affect the exchange rate. At the ZLB, the depreciating channel is amplified, while the appreciating channel is attenuated. Then, the SOE currency depreciates more than in a scenario without ZLB. This passes through to inflation, which affects SOE’s ability to stabilize the economy as it cannot lower its interest rate as much. In an estimated model, this mechanism by itself can explain 26 percent of the lower correlation observed in the data."

At the country level, we document that countries with a larger number of non-zero intersectoral linkages (denser networks) display a more negatively skewed cyclical component of output. At the firm level, we find that firms with a larger number of suppliers and customers (degrees) display a more negatively-skewed distribution of their output growth. To rationalize these findings, we construct a multisector model with input-output linkages and show that the relationship between output skewness and network density naturally arises once we consider non-linearities in production. In an economy with low production flexibility (inputs are gross complements), denser production structures imply that relying on more inputs becomes a risk that further amplifies the effects of negative productivity shocks. The opposite holds if firms display high production flexibility (inputs are gross substitutes): having more inputs to choose from becomes an opportunity to diversify the effects of negative productivity shocks. We calibrate the model using our rich firm-to-firm network Chilean data and show that more connected firms experience larger declines in output in response to a COVID-19 shock, consistent with the data. We also show that, as in the data, the cross-sectional distribution of output growth in the model displays a fatter left tail during downturns. The previous result is shaped by the interplay between production complementarities and network interconnectedness, rather than by the asymmetry of the shocks. The size of the shock determines the strength of the relationship between degrees and output decline, which highlights the importance of non-linearities and the limitations of local approximations."

First, for Chilean financial assets, US shocks account for approximately 12% of the volatility of both short and long rates and 25% of the volatility of the stock market. Second, the transmission of US shocks to local assets comes mainly through risk aversion shocks and pure risk premia, followed by US monetary policy shocks.

Using a dynamic factor model, we first pin down the global drivers that are relevant to a sample of twelve EMEs. Our identification assumption allows for the well-known global financial cycle to coexist with additional global factors of different nature, i.e. commodities, growth/productivity. Next, to better understand how these global forces are transmitted into EMEs we zoom in on Chile—one of the EMEs in the sample—and augment a large-scale DSGE regularly used for policy analysis with the estimated global dynamic factor structure. This allows us to document the general equilibrium channels through which shocks in these global factors are transmitted into the business cycle of Chile and, in turn, the policy challenges that they entail. Our findings indicate a preponderant role of global drivers for EMEs’ business cycles, with a third of their macro variability being traced back to shocks in global dynamic factors. While the global financial cycle is a relevant force, a factor associated to global prices and commodities appears equally important, with a relatively modest role played by pure growth/productivity forces. The general equilibrium analysis for Chile reveals that while some of the ensuing effects of shocks to the financial cycle offset each other, the opposite occurs when a shock to global prices materializes, calling for a more active monetary policy response."

We show that FX interventions in Chile tend to occur during high exchange rate volatility periods, which correlate with domestic and foreign financial factors. Moreover, we show that the FX intervention that started by the end of 2019–the latest intervention included in our study–effectively reduced the exchange rate volatility and the probability of being at a high volatility state."

We then develop a multisector model with inputoutput linkages, financial frictions, and endogenous supply of trade credit and show that the financial shocks after Lehman Brothers’ collapse triggered a response of trade credit that can qualitatively and quantitatively account for the large shift in comovement. A model with fixed trade-credit, subject to the same productivity and financial shocks, generates no increase in comovement and implies a 20% smaller decline in GDP than in the endogenous case. In contrast, we show that trade credit in the other previous recessions acted as a cushion that mitigated negative sectoral spillovers."

This is explained in part because Chile had already adopted tight macroprudential policies after the Banking Law of 1986; therefore, it started the 1990s with a more conservative level of financial regulation than most countries. However, Chile still presents a restrictive Loan to Value regulation, close to the OECD average. In terms of Financial Openness and Capital Controls, Chile was very closed until the Asian crisis.

Our results point toward quantitatively relevant effects induced by shocks to the global factors that we identify. Indeed, while shocks to our financial and commodity factors explain independently about 7 and 21% of GDP fluctuations, respectively, they unload rather differently on long term yields and exchange rates: the financial factor explains about half of exchange rate dynamics and more than a fifth of long rates, where our commodity factor ends up playing a much lesser role."

The results presented are based on a qualitative study that considers the testimonies of 36 household expenditure managers, who were selected considering socio-demographic and territorial diversity criteria. The main findings of the study are organized on three levels: First, there is evidence of a generalized perception of price increases above the usual variation rate, which in turn indicates the existence of an anchored perception to a normal or usual variation of prices. Secondly, in the face of rising prices, households have incorporated various strategies to protect themselves from inflation, highlighting that bringing forward purchases is not as prevalent as might be expected in the face of a potential increase in inflation expectations. The third finding is related to the fact that households expect a normalization of the speed of price increases in one or two years, with no expectations of future modifications in their economic behavior, beyond those already made.

Our new methodology is able to correct the known limitations of different data sources and combine them coherently for the first time using Chilean data. In contrast to estimations in advanced economies we propose methods to estimate data that are not available, which could be use to estimate distributional series in other developing countries with limited official statistics. The validity of the imputations is verified by contrasting the results with various external references. On average, the underestimation of gross wages in the Chilean national household survey as compared to national accounts is 40%, significantly larger than other countries. About a quarter of this gap is attributed to the “missing rich” in the survey. For 2017, this equates to an estimated median gross income for dependent labor of CLP 600,000 and CLP 570,000 for all workers. The corrected mean-median income ratio (Gini) is 26% (17%) larger than in the raw survey of 2017, and falls only 6% (3%) between 2006 and 2017 compared with a larger decline of 12% (11%) in the original data."

Exploiting transitions of firms in and out of networks, we show that network afiliation is associated with higher inequality along two dimensions. First, network firms pay higher average wages than stand-alone firms, increasing between-firm inequality. Second, the dispersion of wages within a network firm is higher than within a stand-alone firm, increasing within-firm inequality. The effects are driven by increases in the wages of top workers, and by the entry of new top workers. Our findings shed light on the relationship between ownership structures and the distribution of labor income in the economy."

We estimate the banks’ equilibrium interest rates, which include latent spreads and/or specific margins. Additionally, we allow a gradual convergence to the target and asymmetric adjustment speeds, as it may be different for active and passive rates and it depends on whether these adjust to higher or lower levels as compared to the current one. The use of regimes based on the relative level of the rate to its objective has advantages over only differentiating between increases and decreases in the monetary policy rate (MPR), since it also recognizes changes in spreads, which exploit the heterogeneity of the banks and include the effects of specific factors. Using Chilean data from January 2004 to September 2019, we find that although there is a direct transmission of MPR on the banks’ interest rates, this is not immediate. In particular, we show that the adjustment of deposits rates to changes in the MPR is faster in a monetary easing, while, for commercial rates, banks adjust their rates more rapidly to a tightening. This result is consistent with international evidence, in particular for larger institutions, but this effect is diluted in a period of less than a year."

Credit demand channels loans toward riskier firms, distributing 4.6% of GDP and increasing firm leverage. Despite increased lending to riskier firms at the micro level, macroeconomic risks remain small. Several factors mitigate aggregate risk: the small weight of riskier firms, the exclusion of the riskiest firms, bank screening, contained expected defaults, and the government absorption of tail risk.

In the context of a small open economy, I study the optimal design of a fiscal consolidation plan under different monetary policy regimes and, in particular, the implications of reducing debt under a currency peg. Two main lessons are derived from the results. First, consolidation is costly enough regarding welfare, so that the fiscal authority would like to implement it at a very slow pace. If the government is forced to do it by a certain deadline, the welfare maximizing path will reduce the losses but will not be able to offset them. Second, from the output perspective, the optimal consolidation path under an independent monetary regime leads to a positive response of aggregate demand. While, under the currency peg, the optimal path induces an economic recession. Devaluation seems to be a key factor in stabilizing output during fiscal consolidation."

Our results show that the impact on lending in these small open economies depends on the interest rate level in the core. When interest rates are high, monetary policy cuts in core economies can reduce credit supply in small open economies. In contrast, when interest rates in core economies are low, further expansionary monetary policy increases lending in small open economies, consistent with an international bank lending channel.

We find no effect of precipitation changes on GDP, but the results confirm a negative impact of higher summer temperatures on Agriculture-Silviculture and Fishing. An increase of one Celsius degree in January implies a 3% and 12% GDP reduction in Agriculture and Fishing, respectively, plus a negative effect on Construction, Electricity, Gas, and Water. Substantial uncertainty can be argued around these results due to the unavailability of region-industry GDP at a quarterly or monthly frequency and the assumption of fixed-coefficients over time. Stress test exercises for 2050 and 2100 that use all the industry coefficients estimated from our model or from an USA model imply a small effect of climate change on the overall Chilean GDP relative to a scenario without further climate change. However, these results should be taken with caution due to the overall fitness of the model. Indeed, under some parameter settings of the model, our stress test implies that the Chilean GDP would fall between -14.8% and -9% in 2050 and between -29.6% and -16.8% in 2100 relative to a scenario without further climate change. t further climate change.

We first uncover a novel theoretical result within a simple static framework: incomplete markets can account for procyclical government spending but not necessarily procyclical tax policy. Explaining procyclical tax policy also requires that the ratio of private to public consumption comoves positively with the business cycle, which leads to larger fluctuations in the tax base.

Many firms may contribute and benefit from foreign trade as suppliers or contractors of other exporting firms. This can be measured as a firm´s contribution to Trade in Value Added using an Extended Supply and Use Table framework. Following recent empirical work led by the OECD, we show for Chile, using the 2013-2016 sample span, that (a) the total contribution of SMEs to exported value added is 33%, considerably larger than their share as final exporters (21%); (b) the indirect contribution of SMEs more than doubles the direct one; (c) most of the indirect contribution of SMEs to exported value added takes place through large exporting firms, and (d) even after considering the total SMEs contribution, such share is smaller than in most OECD countries and has remained relatively stagnant over time.

 """,2021.,The Credit Channel Through the Lens of a Semi- Structural Model,"911, Central Bank of Chile.","In this paper, we estimate a semi-structural model with a banking sector for the Chilean economy. Our innovation consists of incorporating a system of equations that reflects the dynamics of credit, interest rate spreads and loan-loss provisions to the Central Bank of Chile’s semi-structural model “MSEP”. We estimate the model and analyze the macroeconomic effects of incorporating this sector. We find that the banking sector plays a role in accelerating the business cycle through lower spreads and procyclical credit supply, in contrast to the counter-cyclical role it has had in COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, we decompose the effects of this sector’s variables in the historical business cycle. We find that credit growth can explain on average about 0.3 pp of total output gap variation. Moreover, we find that in episodes of severe stress, this role can grow to 1.9 pp, as has been the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. This last fact is important, given that in many cases, monetary policy is faced with the challenge of implementing non-conventional measures, many of them through the commercial banking sector. We find that this specification allows the model to better quantify the impact of measures that have favored the flow of credit specially in periods of stress."

In this context the government faces a trade-off between smoothing expenditures and accumulating assets for precautionary motives, as well as saving in riskfree assets and investing in physical capital. The features of the model and the solution method allow for a detailed exploration of the trade-offs involved, particularly those related to volatility and uncertainty.

We consider in our analysis a set of established measures in the literature, among others: the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) for Chile, the VIX for emerging economies, two indices of real and financial uncertainty constructed by Jurado, Ludvigson and Ng (AER, 2015), and the volatilities of the nominal exchange rate and the domestic stock market index. We find that uncertainty and risk are positively associated with product-level inflation, and with the frequency of positive price changes at the variety-establishment level, as well as a negative association with the frequency of negative price changes. The results are quantitatively important, the values of coefficients can be larger than of those typically estimated for the exchange rate pass-through in the literature and in our own estimations (for fluctuations equivalent to one standard deviation in the explanatory variables). In contrast, we find little association with the magnitudes of price adjustments."

We develop a quantitative model in which heterogeneous firms hire workers of different abilities in an imperfectly competitive labor market and source intermediates from heterogeneous suppliers in a production network. The model delivers an earnings equation with a firm-specific wage premium that depends endogenously on both firm productivities and firm-to-firm linkages in the production network. We establish identification of the model parameters and estimate them using linked employer-employee and firm-to-firm transactions data from Chile. Counterfactual simulations using our estimated model show that heterogeneity in network linkages explains 21% of log earnings variance, while passthrough of productivity shocks via network linkages explains between 20-25% of earnings volatility. We also examine the effects of a minimum wage policy and find strong spillover effects to worker earnings above the wage floor, with substitution of materials for labor explaining around 40% of these effects."

With information on product varieties that accounts for 22% of the CPI basket, we document several empirical findings as regards price setting behaviour in terms of stickiness, that is, frequency, implied duration and the size of price adjustments. We find that in spite of facing large shocks, prices adjusted very little, at a lower frequency and at a smaller size than prior to these two events. We also find that there was a reduction on product variety availability on-line, a typical feature that also has been found during natural disasters such as earthquakes. The reduction in product availability poses additional difficulties to construct CPI indexes and to properly capture price rigidities, which are relevant for monetary policy."

(2019) to the Chilean economy. To this aim, we first develop a Financial Conditions Index (FCI) from a broad set of local and external macro-financial variables covering the period from 1994 to 2020, such as asset prices, short and long-term spreads, and volatility measures that characterizes the vulnerabilities of the domestic financial market. The FCI identifies periods of substantial tight financial conditions that coincide with several episodes of economic downturns and market turmoils such as the 1997 Asian Crisis, the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis, and the coronavirus pandemic in mid-March 2020. The G@R analysis reveals that the FCI contains relevant information to forecast lower future GDP growth distribution quantiles. Thus, our results show that downside risks to growth intensify during periods of economic and financial distress. In particular, the 5th percent quantile of economic growth during the 2007-2009 Global Financial crisis reached roughly -10% due to tighter financial conditions propelled by the deterioration of the credit to GDP gap and adverse external conditions such as higher global volatility and lower terms of trade. These findings, and others discussed in the paper, highlight this methodology’s usefulness as an additional tool to support monitoring and risk management duties by policymakers."

The strength of this self-financing channel depends on the productivity process faced by firms and the parameters associated with the production function, and may be quantified by the elasticity of wealth accumulation to productivity shocks. We propose a framework to jointly estimate the production function, the productivity process, and the wealth accumulation process that is robust to financial frictions. We show that standard methods (e.g. Olley-Pakes) fail under financial frictions: they overestimate the labor elasticity and underestimate the capital elasticity of the production function, and underestimate the persistence and dispersion of the productivity process. We apply our method to the universe of Chilean firms and confirm these predictions, with factor elasticities varying around 25%, and productivity volatility more than doubling. We find evidence that is in line with the self-financing channel: (i) the reaction of investment to productivity shocks is contingent on the stock of collateral, with larger responses from unconstrained firms; (ii) highly productive firms accumulate wealth after positive and persistent productivity shocks, with a larger effect in wealthpoor firms."

A relevant advantage of this dataset relative to previous papers is that provides precise measures of the length of job transitions, as well as the tenure of job keepers. We show that this detailed characterization of the worker’s employment status is important to understand the cyclical behavior of earnings. We find that, consistent with the previous literature, earnings of newly created jobs (new hires) are significantly more sensitive to aggregate unemployment than those of continuing jobs (job keepers). However, and contrary to recent evidence for the US, we find that the larger sensitivity of the earnings of new jobs is a feature of both job-to-job transitions as well as hires from up to six months of non-employment. We also find a relevant degree of heterogeneity in the cyclical response of earnings among job keepers, with earnings being less cyclical for workers with longer tenure. These results highlight that the precise length of tenure and job transitions is relevant to correctly understand the cyclicality of wages. Our results are robust to controlling for changes in the workers relative wage position, suggesting that earnings cyclicality is not only an artifact of the behavior of job transitions inside and outside the firm."

Consequently, a comprehensive but parsimonious inflation rate modelling yields important advantages. In this line, the aim of this article is threefold. First, to document if the Brazilian inflation follows the Hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve (HNKPC) model, tested by econometric means. Second, to extend the scope of the HNKPC from a close- to an open-economy version through a Global Vector Autoregression (GVAR) specification; aiming to quantify the influence of trading partners in forecast accuracy. Third, to compare the multi-horizon predictive ability of the HNKPC in such a way as to identify the predictive gain (or loss) provided by the trading partners and discriminate between them. The HNKPC forecasts are evaluated in a traditional way and compared with several robustness specifications and country-weighting schemes with the GVAR version. The in-sample results do not reject the baseline hypothesis posed by the HNKPC for the Brazilian economy and its main trading partners. However, to a large extent, the evidence favouring the HNKPC at the end of sample plainly weakens. In predictive terms, the results show that the proposed open-economy version of the HNKPC is the best predictive device for Brazilian inflation in a compacted form in the long run. Notably, the euro area and Japan contribute most to forecast accuracy despite the use of a distance-based weighting scheme favouring closer South American trading partners such as Argentina and Chile."

Thus, it is possible to link, with no error, consumer perceptions and 12-month-ahead inflation forecasts with personal characteristics such as gender, age, educational level, county of living, and the economic sector in which they are currently working. By using a sample ranging from 2005.III to 2018.IV, the results suggest that women aged between 35 and 65 years old, with a college degree, living in the Northeastern part of Santiago, and working in Commonality and Public Services sector are the best forecasters. Men aged between 35 and 65 years old, with a college degree, in a tie living in the North-eastern and South-eastern zones but working in Government and Financial Services and Commerce Services sectors respectively, come in second place. Some econometric exercises reinforce and give more support to the winner inflation factor, and reveal that a factor different to the second-best in terms of forecast accuracy displays the characteristics required of a forecasting variable. Remarkably, this factor has the same specifications to the winner factor, with the only difference that it is composed by men instead of women, and thus, it looks promising for further consideration. These results are important because they help to identify the most accurate group when forecasting inflation and, thus, help to refine a routine read of the survey with this purpose."

We use an administrative matched employer-employee census for Chile to provide novel insights on the relationship between productivity gaps between firms and job transitions. As expected, the fraction of worker flows reflecting movements from lower- to higher-productivity firms is greater than that of the opposite sign, but only marginally so. Almost half of all transitions occur ""down the firm-productivity ladder."" This process is also highly heterogeneous across several dimensions. Up-the-ladder flows are more likely for direct job-to-job transitions than those that pass through non-employment. They are also much more likely for young, highskilled workers, whose job transitions comprise in an accounting sense the lion’s share of aggregate productivity growth. Interestingly, workers with higher job turnover rates contribute proportionally the least to aggregate productivity growth. Put together, this evidence is suggests that the productivity benefit of job reallocation might have a net benefit, but this benefit reflects massive and heterogeneous gross flows underneath."

Identification relies on banks' heterogeneous exposure to the prudential policies and the fact that foreign monetary policy shocks are exogenous from the perspective of these economies. After analyzing the effects of the aggregate domestic prudential policy stance, we focus on specific prudential policies targeting mortgage and consumer loans, as well as foreign-currency deposits. Although our overall results are mixed, we find evidence that the strength of international monetary policy spillovers varies depending on the stance of the domestic macroprudential policy. In particular, a tighter reserve requirement stance over foreigncurrency deposits in Chile dampens the effect of an international monetary policy shock on domestic local-currency lending, but reinforces that on foreign-currency lending, whereas in Russia, it dampens the effect on both local currency and foreign currency lending, although to different degrees. Prudential policies targeting the asset side of banks' balance sheets, such as mortgage loans or consumer credit, are found to amplify international monetary policy spillovers in some cases and attenuate in others, depending on the country context."

We decompose the overall dispersion in earnings across workers into between and within-firm components, and then use a two-way fixed effect model with no complementarities for individual earnings (the AKM model) to compare the contributions of firm and worker heterogeneity toward changes in dispersion. First, we find a decline in the dispersion of labor earnings throughout the decade, which is driven almost completely by a reduction in the variance of average earnings between firms. The dispersion of earnings within firms, which explain more than half of the overall dispersion and correlates strongly with productivity at the firm level, did not change. Second, AKM estimates show that systematic differences across workers explain the bulk of earning differences, and that the reduction in worker heterogeneity was the main driver towards a more compact earnings distribution, an effect that was complemented by weaker sorting patterns. Finally, although our results suggest that the AKM model provides a good first-order approximation to the labor earnings determination process, we use an alternative specification that allows for worker-firm complementarities. This estimation suggests a stronger role for sorting and an even weaker role for firms in explaining labor earnings differences in Chile."

There are also differences in how the traders understand questions regarding the future monetary policy rate (MPR); some of them answer what they think the central bank will do, while others what they think it should do. The FTS is distinctive from similar surveys in the sense that it is conducted immediately before and after the monetary policy meetings. This study employs a novel dataset that consists of FTS micro observations to assess the extent to which heterogeneity in the replies to the questionnaire affects how agents take into account MPR surprises when updating their inflation expectations. While the should-do traders incorporate MPR surprises in their one-year-ahead inflation expectations, it is not evident that will-do respondents do so. This could imply that the “model” traders have in mind includes an endogenous MPR path, which is not necessarily in accordance with what they think the central bank is going to do in the short run. The baseline estimates suggest that agents that merely base their forecasts on models do not seem to factor in MPR surprises in their inflation expectations updates, but small sample corrected standard errors indicate that the should-do traders might. On the other hand, for those that use information only from financial markets, only the will-do traders adjust inflation expectations in response to MPR surprises, which could be because asset prices incorporate what the market thinks the central bank is going to do. Two-years-ahead inflation expectations are not affected by MPR surprises. The results help to understand heterogeneity in forecasters’ inflation updates and stress the importance of understanding on what basis survey respondents answer the questions."

In this article, we make use of a rich and unique individual-level dataset obtained by merging a consumer sentiment survey with an unemployment survey of the Greater Metropolitan area of Chile’s capital city. This is aiming to: (i) analyse how forecasts of private consumption and components are improved by consumer sentiment indexes constructed using the labour market characteristics of respondents and re-focusing aggregate answers according to timing and subject, and (ii) analyse to what extent a greater exposure of consumers/workers to the business cycle comes out as a better capability to nowcast and short-term forecast consumption. Considering that consumers work in sectors where decisions are taken based to a greater or lesser extent on the current and future economic situation, we assume a learning mechanism permeable to the sentiment of workers that is present when they are surveyed as consumers, referred to as “exposure”. Since the exposure is extensible to investment decisions, we include total investment and its components in the analysis. By means of auto-regressions, our results suggest that the in-sample adjustment of a simple model improves in most cases when any of the newly built factors are included. Although there is no silver-bullet definition of the factor helping all aggregates across all horizons simultaneously, future-oriented factors as well as information coming from consumers working together in Commerce, Industry, Construction, and Personal Services sectors provide material predictive gains, ranging from 4.5% to 40.2% at one-year compared to the non-augmented auto-regression. Although surveys of consumers’ perceptions provide rich information, these results are important since it is necessary to disentangle ideally from the most disaggregate level to have a better revealing economic behaviour."

Uniform consistency of the estimators is established under general assumptions when N,T?8 jointly. Lastly, under certain additional assumptions related to the density of the observations about the quantile of interest, and the relationship between N and T, I show that the QPC estimators are asymptotically normal with convergence rates similar to the ones derived in the traditional factor analysis literature.

This paper studies the relevance of firms with the USD as their functional currency using a cross-country comparison at the asset level of the corporate sector. Our results show that the case of Chile is not isolated as, for example, Canada, Norway, Israel, Australia, and Peru exhibit an important share of firms with this characteristic.

In addition, these countries share a common factor, since these companies’ assets are concentrated in economic sectors oriented towards international trade. In Chile the importance of these sectors, like Basic Materials, Forestry and paper, and Mining, explains the high proportions of firms with USD as their functional currency. These conclusions are important to consider when analyzing a country's external debt and the potential exchange rate risks, such as currency mismatch, due to the effect of dollar debt in the balance sheet. During depreciations, it has been a concern among Latin-American firms, especially during the emerging-market financial crises of the 1990s."

This paper provides a unified framework to organize the policy debate related to firm financing during the downturn, centered along four main points. First, the economic crisis triggered by the spread of the virus is radically different from past crises, with important consequences for optimal policy responses. Second, to avoid inefficient bankruptcies and long-term detrimental effects, it is important topreserve firms' relationships with key stakeholders, like workers, suppliers, customers, and creditors. Third, firms can benefit from “hibernating,” using the minimum bare cash necessary to withstand the pandemic, while using credit to remain alive until the crisis subdues. Fourth, the existing legal and regulatory infrastructure is ill-equipped to deal with an exogenous systemic shock such as this pandemic. Financial sector policies can help increase the provision of credit, while posing difficult choices and trade-offs."

In this paper, we open up this construct by analyzing the entire universe of procurement contracts of the US government and establish five facts. First, government spending is granular, that is, it is concentrated in relatively few firms and sectors. Second, relative to private expenditures its composition is biased. Third, procurement contracts are short-lived. Fourth, idiosyncratic variation dominates the fluctuation of spending. Last, government spending is concentrated in sectors with relatively sticky prices. Accounting for these facts within a stylized New Keynesian model offers new insights into the fiscal transmission mechanism: fiscal shocks hardly impact inflation, little crowding out of private expenditure exists, and the multiplier tends to be larger compared to a one-sector benchmark aligning the model with the empirical evidence."

The differing perspectives are due in part to a lack of empirical studies that look at the intensive margin of controls, which in turn has prevented a quantitative assessment of optimal capital control models against the data. We contribute to this debate by addressing both positive and normative features of capital controls. On the positive side, we build a new dataset using textual analysis, from which we document a set of stylized facts of capital controls along their intensive and extensive margins for 21 emerging markets. We document that capital controls are ""sticky""; that is, changes to capital controls do not occur frequently, and when they do, they remain in place for a long time. Overall, they have not been used systematically across countries or time, and there has been considerable heterogeneity across countries in terms of the intensity with which they have been used. Onthe normative side, we extend a model of capital controls relying on pecuniary externalities augmented by including an (S; s) cost of implementing such policies. We illustrate how this friction goes a long way toward bringing the model closer to the data. When the extended model is calibrated for each of the countries in the new dataset, we find that the size of these costs is large, thus substantially reducing the welfare-enhancing effects of capital controls compared with the frictionless Ramsey benchmark. We conclude with a discussion of the structural interpretations of such costs, which calls for a richer set of policy constraints when considering the use of capital controls in models of pecuniary externalities."

The restrictions implied by the model suppose a setup where one of the factors affects the variance of excess returns. Therefore, the factor model is estimated employing an adapted version of the Quantile Principal Components estimation procedure proposed by Sagner (2019). Simulations of the structural model under alternative parameterizations calibrated for the US show a good performance of the proposed systemic risk metric computed at quantiles different than the median. When estimated using quarterly post-war data, the proposed measure displays significant hikes that coincide with both several US recession periods and episodes of substantial financial market turbulences. Finally, the systemic risk estimator can forecast sharp shifts in both economic activity and industrial production up to one quarter ahead."

We stress the importance of analysing each prudential policy separately, as results may vary due to banks' exposure to such policies as well as different mechanisms of transmission in place. Overall, tight foreign-currency reserve requirements seem to dampen the transmission of foreign monetary policy shocks significantly, while reinforcing that of local monetary policy. However, this result is less robust for other prudential policies considered. Finally, adverse spillovers from tightening capital requirements abroad may be amplified by a tight monetary policy at home."

In the first part of the paper, we show that the self-reported measure proves to provide a more comprehensive view of household over-indebtedness than the one obtained from the financial indicators traditionally used for this purpose. In the second part, we estimate a bivariate probit with sample selection to analyze what factors are associated with the over-indebtedness condition. We find that income is an important factor for over-indebtedness, but it does not affect the probability of holding debt. In addition, we show that temporary workers are more prone to over-indebtedness than workers with permanent contracts. Finally, one of the most important results of our paper is that we show that an unexpected shock has a significant effect on both holding debt and reporting being over-indebted. Our results indicate that an appropriate evaluation of the over-indebted condition should consider more than traditionally used financial indicators. We also provide arguments in favor of a comprehensive credit register that would help credit suppliers to better manage credit risks."

The model was built to explain Chile's linkages with the external sector, to recognize that the sectors of the economy have particular price dynamics that are affected differently by shocks that move the nominal exchange rate, and to study different measures of exchange rate pass through (ERPT). We show unconditional and conditional ERPT measures. The former measures are comparable with the empirical literature, while the latter are defined after a particular shock hit the economy. We highlight important differences in their magnitudes and in their effect on different prices. While a shock to international prices has a transitory and low ERPT, one that affects the uncovered interest rate parity condition has a very high and persistent ERPT for all price indexes. In addition, the prices that are more rapidly affected are those of tradable sectors, while non-tradable prices are affected with a lag, but for longer. We use the model to show that the conditional ERPT measures could have helped to anticipate a great part of the inflationary effects of the depreciation following the tapering announcements of the US in 2013-2015, which was not possible using unconditional ERPT measures of the empirical literature."

Quantitatively, we calibrate our full model to 341 sectors using U.S. data and find (1) fully heterogeneous price rigidity across sectors doubles the aggregate volatility from sectoral shocks relative to a calibration with homogeneous price rigidity; 2) realistically calibrated sectoral productivity shocks are key to generating sizable aggregate fluctuations of both GDP and prices; 3) heterogeneity of price rigidity matters because it changes the effective distribution of sector size and network centrality.

The main quantitative exercise consists in measuring the gains of switching from the (procyclical) spending path of the typical developing country to an acyclical or countercyclical path. The model emphasizes the role of transfer payments from the government to households in alleviating the costs of idiosyncratic shocks. Since these correlate with aggregate shocks, the way fiscal policy is conducted along the business cycle has important welfare effects. I find that the costs of procyclicality are relatively large and very heterogeneous. While wealth-rich agents don't suffer from procyclicality, poor agents, being either unemployed or unskilled, lose the most. In terms of life-time consumption equivalents these agents may lose as much as 2% from fiscal procyclicality, considering only the fraction of spending that is allocated as transfer payments."

The findings suggest that, on average, workers maximize returns to experience throughout the initial years after entering the work force. Additional results deliver further evidence in favor of greater returns for workers with higher-educational level and for those who are employed in cognitive occupations. Furthermore, this article also provides evidence that under this criterion returns to experience exhibit a relevant gender gap in favor of male workers. In addition, it assesses how macroeconomic conditions affect the accumulation of these returns. After conducting an econometric analysis to avoid possible collinearity between age, time, and birth cohort effects, estimated returns are lower along the first years, while higher at the end of the workers' productive period. The life-cycle wage-growth profile documented by the literature for Chile is consistent with estimates for other countries with similar levels of development. Nevertheless, throughout the median of the individual's working life, returns are marginally lower than expected given the country's income level."

To account for the potential endogeneity of infrastructure (as well as that of other regressors), we use a variety of GMM estimators based on both internal and external instruments, and report results using both disaggregated and synthetic measures of infrastructure quantity and quality. The two robust results are: (i) growth is positively affected by the stock of infrastructure assets, and (ii) income inequality declines with higher infrastructure quantity and quality. A variety of specification tests suggest that these results do capture the causal impact of the exogenous component of infrastructure quantity and quality on growth and inequality. These two results combined suggest that infrastructure development can be highly effective to combat poverty.

Our results indicate that the rising exposure of the U.S. economy to international trade can indeed help explain a significant fraction of the overall decline in responsiveness of aggregate inflation to fluctuations in economic activity. This flattening of the U.S. Phillips curve is supported strongly by our cross-sectional evidence, which shows that increased trade exposure significantly attenuates the response of inflation to fluctuations in output across industries.

Using country and sector quarterly data over the period 1985Q1-2018Q1 we find a strong link between labor cost and price inflation in the four major economies of the euro area and across the three main sectors. The dynamic interaction between prices and wages is timevarying and depends on the state of the economy and on the shocks hitting the economy. Our results show that it is more likely that labor costs are passed on to price inflation with demand shocks than with supply shocks. However, the pass-through is systematically lower in periods of low inflation as compared to periods of high inflation. These results confirm that, under circumstances of predominantly demand shocks, labor cost increases will be passed on to prices. Coming from a period of low inflation, however, this pass-through could be moderate at least until inflation stably reaches a sustained path."

With that in mind, I account for the “supply-side origins” of annual U.S. PCE inflation. I measure how employee compensation, the cost of capital goods, and imports and imported intermediates, as well as measured productivity growth in different industries contribute to inflation in the price of the final goods and services that make up Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) in the United States. What has driven inflation dynamics is not the change in the U.S. supply chain of consumer goods and services or changes in factor shares. Instead, it has been the movements in import prices, more specifically oil prices, that have driven inflation over the past two decades. They alone account for 45 percent of the variance of annual PCE inflation in the U.S. from 1999-2015."

During these months the nominal increase in our measure of the cost of the goods included in the core CPI was as high as 10%. Motivated by these events, we use a menu cost model of price adjustment to derive the theoretical pass-through of large cost shocks to consumer prices for an economy with an underlying inflation rate of the order of 25% per year, as well as the impact of these shocks on the size and on the frequency of price changes. Using a comprehensive, never used in the price adjustment literature, micro-data set underlying the construction of the core CPI for the city of Buenos Aires we compare the theoretical effect of the cost shocks to the empirical one. As predicted by the theory we find that despite the high level of underlying inflation, the large frequency of both price increases and decreases points to the importance of idiosyncratic firm shocks, such as the ones we use in our model. Right after large increases in costs, both the fraction of price increases and the average size of price increases dramatically rises, while the size of price decreases stays approximately the same, just at the simple model predicts. On the other hand, the model predicts a small decrease in the fraction of price decreases which we don't observe in the data. We conclude that for large sudden changes in cost, consumer prices behave almost as if they were fully flexible. On the other hand, for small shocks the short-term pass-through will be smaller and its half-life larger."

This paper argues that inflation behavior is easier to understand if we divide headline inflation into core and transitory components, and if core inflation is measured by the weighted median of industry inflation rates. This weighted median is less volatile than the traditional measure of core inflation, the inflation rate excluding food and energy prices, because it filters out large price changes in all industries. We illustrate the usefulness of the weighted median with a case study of inflation in 2017 and early 2018. We also show that a Phillips curve relating the weighted median to unemployment appears clearly in the data for 1985-2017, with no sign of a breakdown in 2008."

Quantitatively, heterogeneity in the frequency of price adjustment is the most important driver behind large real effects. Heterogeneity in input-output linkages and consumption shares contribute only marginally to real effects but alter substantially the identity and contribution of the most important sectors to the transmission of monetary shocks. In the model and data, reducing the number of sectors decreases monetary non-neutrality with a similar impact response of inflation. Hence, the initial response of inflation to monetary shocks is not sufficient to discriminate across models and for the real effects of nominal shocks and ignoring heterogeneous consumption shares and input-output linkages identifies the wrong sectors from which the real effects originate."

A negative but moderate effect on firm-level productivity helps to explain this persistence. Also, the dispersion of the marginal productivity of capital increases within more affected firms. In the aggregate, productivity growth explains around a third of the impact of the credit crunch on output growth in the medium run.

The Effect of “Average” Distortions on TFP Gains Estimations,"835, Central Bank of Chile.","In recent years a vast literature has been devoted to estimate the degree of misallocation in different countries, sectors and time periods using Hsieh & Klenow (2009) -henceforth HK- framework. Even if we take the HK model at face value, such estimations still depend (heavily) on the assumed production technologies and elasticity of substitution. How much of the estimated TFP gain from eliminating distortions is due to actual TFPR dispersion among firms and how much is related to the specific parameterization of the model? We propose a decomposition of the inferred distortions that allows us to isolate the effect of “average” distortions (which depend on the parameterization and are defined at the industry level) from that of “dispersion” distortions (which are unaffected by the parameters and operate at the firm level). Using a newly available administrative dataset with the universe of Chilean firms between 1999 and 2015, we show that TFP gains from eliminating misallocations using the standard HK parameterization are 58% in the manufacturing sector (68% for the entire economy), but are reduced to 28% (44%) once the “mean” components of the distortions are removed. We find that the fraction of TFP gains explained by ”average” distortions increased significantly in Chile between 2000 and 2013, which is mainly explained by a sustained increase in average markups. We verify the robustness of our results using different datasets from Chile and Colombia."

Our results show that factor reallocation plays a relevant role in explaining the evolution of aggregate TFP in Chile over the last decade. Firms with higher TFPR hire more workers, have stronger capital growth, and have a larger probability of survival. However, the extent of reallocation does not prevent a large, persistent dispersion in TFPR among firms. The magnitude of this dispersion suggests that further reallocation could bring up first-order gains in aggregate productivity and output.

However, most of the foreign-born are overqualified for the jobs they hold despite being on overage more educated than the native-born. Even though immigrants face an adjustment period upon arrival into the country, their unemployment rate does not differ substantially from that of the native-born.

Our model is designed to isolate the effects of credit deepening through demand-side channels, and abstracts from potential effects of credit supply on total factor productivity. In the calibrated model, credit deepening generates only modest above-trend growth in consumption, investment, and GDP. Since Brazil has experienced one of the most intense credit deepening processes in Latin America, we argue that the quantitative effects that hinge on the channels captured by the model are unlikely to be sizable elsewhere in Latin America."

First, while the literature describes a single ERPT measure, in a general equilibrium model the evolution of the exchange rate and prices will differ depending on the shock hitting the economy. Accordingly, we distinguish between conditional and unconditional ERPT measures, showing that they can lead to very different interpretations. Second, in a general equilibrium model the ERPT crucially depends on the expected behavior of monetary policy, but the empirical approaches in the literature cannot account for this and thus provide a misleading guide for policy makers. We first use a simple model of a small and open economy to qualitatively show the intuition behind these two critiques.

We compare their main features in terms of timing, representativeness, questionnaires, and aggregation of responses. We note the shortcomings of composite indices that combine questions with different focus and time perspective and propose instead eight alternative measures distinguishing between current sentiment/future expectations and between personal/country-wide perceptions. Our results suggest that future and country-wide perceptions are formed with distinct information from personal and current sentiment, and the latter are somewhat affected by the former. When turning to the ability of the existing and alternative measures to contribute to macro-aggregates forecasting, we find a rather strong relationship between personal and aggregate perceptions, consumption actions and actual consumption, especially of durables, outpacing the predictive ability of the existing synthetic indicator. On the business side, the predictive value of surveys seems to be stronger for employment than for investment, while employment and investment seem to Grangercause personal sentiment/expectations. This suggests that while broad perceptions tend to be shaped by independent information, the assessment of the own situation is reassured through actual employment and investment actions. The low ability of economic perception measures to predict investment behavior, in turn, confirms that investment actions are far more complex and projectspecific to be captured by responses to rather broad questions. In all, while surveys of economic perceptions are a rich source of information, it is necessary to select the surveys and questions that are more revealing of present and prospective behavior."

 """,2018.,Institutional Quality and Sovereign Flows,"816, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper evidences the relevance of mercantilism and sudden stops in emerging’market economies as a joint explanation for positive net public foreign assets, while political-economy frictions account for the varying degrees that asset accumulation is achieved across economies with similar characteristics. An increase of 50 percent in these frictions implies a reduction of almost 20 percentage points of GDP in net foreign public assets, in the context of economies with growth externalities, therefore a motive for mercantilism exists. In its absence, on the other hand, the sovereigns accumulate net foreign liabilities, which makes their access to international markets more infrequent. In a model without mercantilist motives, political-economy frictions explain less of the differences in net foreign positions (5 percentage points of GDP), but can explain great differences in sovereign risk: a reduction of 70 percent in politicaleconomy frictions can reduce the sovereign spread by 800 basis points."

Due to the growth rate of its transactions, it is acquiring international relevance, as well as in Chile. In countries where this practice has presented greater depth there are financial policy responses imposing limits and providing protections to its users. The paper presents a first diagnosis of this activity in Chile and compiles public statistics to December 2016, quantifying around US$ 180 million traded, mainly focused on loans to companies (which represent 96% of the amount and 85% of the projects). Of these last transactions, we observe an average annual interest rate of 13.4% nominal, which must be adjusted to the fees of platforms. Although the activity is possibly presented as a more convenient financial alternative than the traditional one, and references show that large companies pay lower interest rates than small and medium-size enterprises, it is not possible to induce a vis-à-vis comparison with the available rates of capital markets entities, since the latter’s operations are limited according to the regulatory perimeter and crowdfunding conditions are not necessarily subject to comparable credit risk standards."

In particular, we can identify the presence of multiple cores and peripheries, as well as different ways of interaction between them. We find that such a varied coreperiphery structure exists in almost all periods for different instruments analyzed. Also, in the case of term deposits, which account for two-thirds of interbank exposures, we find that far from being static, the structure underwent a transition in the period 2009-2015, with the core increasing its size. We also show that facts revealed by our approach cannot be observed in metrics commonly used to describe networks. Finally, we describe how the elements identified by our method can be used to single out sources and channels of transmission of systemic risk in a network of banks."

Specifically, the short-run elasticities of manufacturing exports differ in size: (i) the elasticity of foreign demand —approximated by trading partners’ activity aggregates— ranges between 1.4 and 2; and (ii) the elasticity with respect to the bilateral real exchange rate is comprehended in the interval [0.4 - 0.6].

We find evidence that distance matters for the cost of crossborder borrowing, as well as the intensity and age of banking relationships.

However, its various components may follow different paths depending on the pricing mechanisms in each market. This has led to building price sub-indices with a higher degree of homogeneity within them for analytical purposes. This paper focuses its attention on the behavior of prices of services in Chile. The latter are of special interest because they not only account for about half of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), but because their dynamics over time have differed significantly from the prices of goods. Our empirical analysis is based on the estimation of a set of Hybrid Neokeynesian Phillips Curves (HNKPC), which allows comparing the value and statistical significance of the estimated elasticities of various CPI components to those obtained for headline. The results suggest that: (i) HNKPC maintains a high degree of validity as a proxy for inflation determination, with significant values for key elasticities in all of its disaggregations; (ii) the disaggregated HNKPC estimate does not reduce the statistical significance of the results; (iii) Chile's inflationary history explains the high elasticity of lagged inflation and inflation expectations; (iv) the aggregate dynamics of services inflation differs from that of goods in both their adjustment and their response to shocks on its main components, a response that has varied unevenly in the recent period; (v) important differences in the behavior of indexed and non-indexed services by the nature of the covariates and the size of the basic HNKPC coefficients are found; (vi) the disaggregation of services raises its conceptual consistency without jeopardizing the forecasting ability of services inflation as a whole and is superior to other disaggregations of services, and (vii) the construction of indices by collecting prices at producer or provider level makes it difficult to compare the changes in purchasing power resulting from the application of specific taxes or subsidies. All these results suggest the usefulness of splitting the CPI between large components or sub-indices to improve inflation forecasts, including their insertion in more complex models for macroeconomic analysis."

After controlling for macroeconomic factors and idiosyncratic characteristics of banks, we found that the perceptions reported in the SLOS are statistically and economically significant in explaining the dynamics of credit.

Interestingly enough, even though the current trend unemployment rate is not materially different to what it was fifty years ago, our results suggest the labor market is considerably more dynamic. The increase in trend hazard rates occurs in the context of significant changes in economic growth, ongoing reallocation of output towards services relative to manufacturing, important regulatory changes in the labor market, and a gradual shift in the composition of the labor force. In addition, our estimates suggest that changes in the finding rate are relatively more important than changes in the separation rate in explaining the variance of the unemployment rate. From an international perspective our estimates suggest that in spite of having relatively rigid labor legislation, the Chilean labor market appears to be as dynamic as an average Anglo-Saxon country, yet less dynamic than the labor market of the United States."

This has led to increased interest in the “Neo-Fisherian"" proposition according to which low nominal interest rates may themselves cause inflation to be lower. The fact that standard models have the property that perfect foresight equilibria with a low fixed interest rate forever involve low inflation might seem to support such a view. Here, however, we argue that such a conclusion depends on a misunderstanding of the circumstances under which it makes sense to predict the effects of a monetary policy commitment by calculating the perfect foresight equilibrium (PFE). We propose an explicit cognitive process by which agents form their expectations of future endogenous variables. Under some circumstances, such as a commitment to follow a Taylor rule, a PFE can arise as a limiting case of our more general concept of reflective equilibrium. But we show that a policy of fixing the interest rate for a long period of time creates a situation in which reflective equilibrium need not resemble any PFE. In our view, this makes PFE predictions not plausible outcomes in the case of policies of the latter sort. According to our alternative approach, a commitment to maintain a low nominal interest rate for longer should always be expansionary and inflationary; but likely less so than the usual PFE analysis would imply, and much less in the case of a long-horizon commitment."

High ZPI episodes tend to occur during recessions and are c by a combination of the initial state of the variables and the estimated volatility of the shocks. However, not all episodes of a high ZPI share the same causes. In the US recessions of the 1980s, the probability was influenced significantly by an exceptionally volatile environment that overcame the dampening influence of the period’s high nominal interest rates. On the other hand, the high ZPI for the 2001 and 2007 recessions were mainly defined by an initial state of low interest rates. Because of this difference, an increase in the inflation target was much more effective in reducing the estimated probability of the interest rate reaching the ZLB in the latter episodes."

Under this framework, the welfare cost of inflation is amplified through a feedback loop, in which restricted money demand reduces the number of firms that the market can support. In turn, this reduction increases market concentration, reduces the consumer surplus, and further decreases the incentives to hold money. I find that, depending on the calibration, between 63 to 90 percent of the estimated welfare costs of inflation can be attributed to the interaction between money holdings and market concentration."

This result is robust to different specifications, and might suggest that foreign subsidiaries in Chile behave just like domestic banks, as they have to comply with the local regulation in the same way as local banks.

In this paper, I develop a flexible framework to estimate the aggregate elasticity of substitution between labor and capital for a panel of countries. In contrast to previous studies, my framework considers country heterogeneity in the elasticity of substitution. The growth rates of labor- and capital- augmenting technologies are also allowed to vary across countries and time while retaining some commonalities across the panel via a dynamic factor model. Estimation is based on posterior distributions in a Bayesian fixed effects framework. I propose a computationally convenient procedure to compute posterior distributions in two steps that combines the Gibbs and the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. Using the EU KLEMS database, I find evidence of heterogeneity in the elasticity of substitution across countries, with a mean of 0.90 and standard deviation of 0.23. The bias in the technical change is the dominant mechanism in explaining the labor share decline in the majority of countries. However, the increase in the capital-labor ratio (or the decline in the price of investment goods) is also an important mechanism for some countries. Finally, I find a strong correlation between direction of the technical change, the elasticity of substitution and the relative endowment of capital and labor."

Data examination of the last three decades shows that: (a) the unemployment rate shows sharp changes only when the job destruction flows increase sharply. This has been a characteristic of recessionary periods and not of the rather gradual decelerations like has been observed lately; (b) the importance in the labor force of those older than 55 years has increased significantly, while it has declined for those younger than 25, introducing a downward trend in the unemployment rate; and (c) the lower relative weight in the labor force of men between 25 and 54 years opens the door to a more “atypical” behavior of the aggregate unemployment rate.

The GVAR point forecast is evaluated using the Mean Squared Forecast Error (MSFE) statistic and statistically compared with several benchmarks. These belong to traditional statistical modelling, such as autoregressions (AR), the exponential smoothing model (ES), and the random walk model (RW). One last economics-based benchmark is the closed economy univariate HNKPC. The results indicate that the GVAR has a low performance compared to that exhibited by the RW. The most accurate forecasts, however, are obtained with the AR and especially with the univariate HNKPC. In the long-run, the ES model also appears as a better alternative rather than the RW. The MSPE is obviously affected by the unanticipated effects of the financial crisis started in 2008. So, when considering an evaluation sample just before the crisis, the GVAR appears as a valid alternative for some countries in the long-run. The most robust forecasting devices across countries and horizons result in the univariate HNKPC, giving a role for economic fundamentals when forecasting inflation."

The aim of this article is to analyse the out-of-sample behaviour of a bunch of statistical and economics-based models when forecasting FX for the UK, Japan, and the Euro Zone in relation to the US, emphasising the commodity prices boom of 2007-8 and the financial crisis of 2008-9. We analyse the forecasting behaviour of six economic plus three statistical models when forecasting from one up to 60-steps-ahead, comprising from 1981.1 to 2014.6. Our six economicsbased models can be classified in three groups: interest rate spreads, monetary fundamentals, and purchasing power parity with global measures, covering a wide range of macroeconomic indicators. Our results indicate that there are changes of the best models when considering different time spans. In particular, interest-rate-based models tend to be better at predicting before 2008, also showing a better tracking when crisis hit. However, when considering until 2014, the models based on price differentials are more promising, but subject to heterogeneity across countries. These results are important since shed some light on what model specification use and combine when forecast facing different FX volatility."

For this purpose measures of income inequality are constructed from data from the Survey of Employment and Unemployment of the Universidad de Chile. To identify events of banking and inflationary crises we used indicators defined by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. Furthermore, to determine the business cycle and employment fluctuations we use the Gerhart Bry and Charlotte Boschan algorithm. The relationship between episodes of crisis and fluctuations on levels of inequality are estimated from an event study, finding that they are related to fluctuations in inequality. In addition, we perform econometric estimates where inequality indicators relate to different macroeconomic variables and educational performance. The main conclusions are that banking and inflation crises, as well as periods of severe cyclical contractions, tend to increase the levels of inequality in Chile. Our results show that achieving levels of macro-financial stability in the economy contributes not only to sustain growing levels of average income per capita, but also to avoid negative effects on equity."

The resulting learning model fits U.S. data better than its non-sentiment version and than its rational expectations counterpart. Sentiment is found to be an important driver of economic fluctuations, accounting for up to half of the forecast error variance of aggregate variables at business cycle frequencies. Furthermore, sentiment displays a common pattern for real GDP, investment and consumption growth, where a significant part of the sluggish recovery following a recession can be attributed to the persistent pessimistic views of agents. Sentiment also explains a substantial fraction of the high inflation experienced during the 70’s and early 80’s."

What Affects Chilean Banks’ Interest Rates?","780, Central Bank of Chile.","The analysis in this paper is focused on how the pass-through of changes in the monetary policy rate (MPR), expectations of MPR changes, and different measures of risks affect banks’ interest rates. Nominal and real lending and deposit rates are examined as are different maturities for the cases of nominal lending rates. Several measures of risk are constructed and incorporated into the analysis to take into account credit, market, liquidity, and interest rate risk. Evidence suggests that the pass-through of MPR changes is symmetric and instantaneous complete for the majority of the lending horizons of commercial and consumer loans with nominal rates. Pass- through is symmetric for commercial loans and deposits with real rates, but not for mortgage loans. Generally, liquidity, market, and credit risks are important for the banks when setting interest rates, while interest rate risks affect mainly consumer loans and deposits with nominal rates. Inflation changes affect the real rates of commercial loans and deposits as well as nominal consumer loans with a long maturity. Inflation expectations are mainly taken into account when setting real rates of commercial and mortgage loans. Expectations of MPR changes affect principally the rates of mortgage loans."

The 2000s were characterized by an economic expansion concentrated on low-skill-intensive service sectors. The expansion induced an increase in the demand for low-skilled labor relative to highskilled labor, which compressed the skill premium. Procyclical fiscal policy exacerbated the distributional effects of the boom by contributing to the growth of the service sector. I first document the expansion was concentrated on services while manufacturing lagged behind, and show declining inequality is associated with procyclical fiscal policy. I then rationalize the evidence using a small open economy DSGE model that features a low-skill-intensive nontradable sector relative to the tradable sector, and procyclical government purchases. This framework implies that at least part of the decline in inequality is transitory, a prediction supported by recent data"

The latter contrasts with research on the macroeconomics of labor markets that has emphasized the relevance of the extensive margin and employment fluctuations using search and matching theory. Against this background, in this paper we conduct a horse race of a labor market specification with Calvo wages versus a search and matching specification with endogenous separations in an otherwise standard New Keynesian small open economy model, estimated with Chilean data. We conclude that the search and matching specification “wins” by a wide margin as it significantly improves the model’s ability to explain and predict both labor market data and other macroeconomic variables"

Second, these effects work through markedly different channels on different country groups: while the effects in developed economies work mostly through risk neutral rates -associated with signaling effects in the course of future monetary policy-, spillovers to emerging countries are concentrated predominantly on the term premium channel -associated with portfolio rebalancing effects. Third, these spillovers are large compared to the effects of other events, and at least as large as the effects of domestic MP in long-term rates after 2008."

Overall, in almost 90% of the countries the use of any of these two variables improves the forecasting accuracy compared to the case without any exogenous factor. In 74 and 60% of the countries the global-inflation-based forecast outperforms oil-based forecast at 1- and 12-months-ahead.

Our results indicate that expectations are responsive to aggregate contractionary shocks, but not to expansionary shocks. Particularly, contractionary demand shocks have a negative effect on short term monetary policy expectations, while contractionary supply shocks have negative effect on medium and long term expectations. Moreover, shocks to different economies do not have significantly different effects on expectations, although some differences across countries arise."

A simple theoretical model is used to argue that the inflation rate also has to be taken into account when analyzing monetary pass-through. The focus is on nominal and real interest rates for commercial and consumer loans with different payback horizons. Taking a closer look at the construction of the interest rate data available, it becomes clear that short-term consumption rates are quite rigid and, thus, by construction react less to changes in the policy rate. Evidence from panel estimations with Chilean data for the period 2008 to 2014 suggests that short-term commercial rates react quite fast to changes in the monetary policy rate, while those at long-term seem to react more to inflation. Particularly size and deposit strength affect banks when fixing nominal commercial rates, while the determination of rates of consumer loans is particularly influenced by bank size and capital strength. With respect to real interest rates, commercial loans are affected by deposit strength, noninterest income and external obligations, while mortgages are affected by liquidity strength and provisions. The evidence provided in the present study reveals that the degree to which different bank characteristics affect pass-through of changes in the monetary policy rate and inflation depends to a great extent on the horizons of the loans."

We do this for different groups of commodities and different groups of countries. The results confirm the existence of a resource curse, which is contingent on the quality of institutions and varies with the type of commodities. The new findings are related to fiscal policy. The cyclical conduct of fiscal policy explains a large fraction of the long-run effects of commodity prices on GDP per capita. The systematic response of fiscal spending to changes in commodity prices beyond the cyclical stance of the economy is relevant for obtaining this result. In general, if fiscal policy is conducted in a procyclical way, the long-run effect of an increase in commodity prices becomes more negative. But this is not always the case.For certain commodities and group of countries the effect is the opposite. All of these results are driven by the time variation in fiscal policy and obtained after controlling for institutional quality."

If, however, electric power could be more easily replaceable by labor and capital, the fall in steady-state GDP predicted by the model would be significantly lower (-0.1%).

It is taken into account that shocks with different sources may have different impacts and a separation is made between supply, demand, and specific copper demand shocks. The empirical analysis is based on a structural VAR model, where shocks are identified by sign restrictions, i.e. restrictions are imposed on impulse-response functions. Indeed the results show that the source of the shock is relevant for the economic impact. While a rise in the copper price caused by increased world demand implies higher growth in Chile, impacts of supply and specific copper demand shocks are, at least in the short run, negative for growth. Higher growth in the case of a demand shock implies higher inflation after a couple of quarters and a following more restrictive monetary policy (higher interest rate). A supply shock, on the other hand, does not have significant effects on either inflation or the interest rate. A specific copper demand shock results in a (though not statistically significantly) depreciation of the exchange rate and higher inflation, which, in turn, implies a higher interest rate."

To understand the behavior of the nominal yield curve in Chile, we rely on an affine dynamic term structure model (DTMS) which allows to decompose the term structure into the expected short-term premium (related to the monetary policy expectation) and a term premia. We show that most of the fall of long-term interest rates as well as its dynamics are related to the term premia rather than the expected short-term interest rate. With this, we report that the term premia is driven primarily by nominal uncertainty, i.e. the uncertainty for expected inflation two years ahead and the US term premia."

The results suggest that the degree of pass-through depends on the own characteristics of the exchange rate shock, mainly its expected persistence. The sign of the exchange rate variation also plays an important role. The evidence indicates that the state of the economy (output gap and real exchange rate gap) is less influential."

After the crisis, world imports increased sustainably, which was used by Chilean firms in particular and the country in general. Specifically, larger firms, and those that had lower external financing needs, were benefited the most from the new international context, increasing their exports to markets that already exported before and recovering the markets they lost during the crisis. While the recovery is mainly due to the intensive margin, the present work shows that the larger firms also increased their export destinations, so that recovery takes place in the 2 types of margins. Finally, in a survival analysis, the results indicate that larger firms needed less time to regain its level of exports that have before the financial crisis."

After that, we compare this indicator with a variety of standard metrics proposed in the literature. We find that our metric reasonably captures episodes of liquidity crises and therefore can be used as a complementary tool in the assessment of systemic risks."

Although, in average, relative prices would have evolved favorably for Chilean exports, this adjustment has been heterogeneous among trading partners. Based on estimates for a panel of annual data – by trading partner and economic activity – we found that export volumes would be highly sensitive to RER, especially when using a bilateral real exchange rate (BRER) measure.

Ex-ante policies, such as prudential policies, have a variety of effects on the various components of the ex-post incentives of an authority to implementing a bailout. Thus, the interaction between prudential policies and bailouts is delicate: In different conditions, a given prudential policy may backfire or increase its effectiveness by worsening or alleviating the lack of commitment problem of bailouts. Liquidity requirements and prudential taxes are examples of prudential policies that may backfire. Public debt is an example of an ex-ante policy usually with no prudential motivation that may play such a role."

Second, we look at their role in facilitating an offsetting event on outflows (a retrenchment or a flight) to an event on inflows (a stop or a surge, respectively). We find that both FEER and AA increase significantly the probability of a retrenchment occurring when a stop has taken place; while lower CC increases the probability of a flight in the event of a surge. Finally, we look at the extent at which funds lost (gained) in a stop (surge) are compensated by funds gained (lost) in a retrenchment (flight). We find that FERR remain the most significant policy tool behind the compensation of stops, as well as CC is for the compensation of surges."

Given the asymmetry we observe in boom and bust cycles, we estimate the output cost of commodity price shocks on separate samples, with a special emphasis in emerging economies. In particular, we focus on the output cost of a commodity price reversal given the credit increase observed during a boom event. We find that, in line with previous literature, the correlation between commodity shocks and output growth decreases as economies are more open to financial markets. The novelty is that we also find that this correlation is higher when countries experience very rapid credit growth during the Upturn phase of a boom. That is, rapid credit growth –regardless of its initial level—exacerbates the cost of a commodity price reversal."

In Chile there are three major types of mortgage loans, but the market is concentrated in the type without regulatory limits to the LTV. However, most mortgage loans are still granted in the 80%-90% LTV range, suggesting that a “no money down” credit policy is infrequent in residential mortgages. Our analysis allows us to infer that a nonnegligible fraction of mortgage loans are paired with an unsecured consumer loan to finance their down payment. This implies not only to a higher effective interest rate, but also a significantly higher financial burden during the first few years of the mortgage. Thus, imposing such a constraint on the LTV ratio could prove riskier than expected. Given that even in the absence of restrictions we encounter these unsecured bridge loans, this practice may be exacerbated upon imposing regulatory limitations. Finally, assuming an inelastic supply for residential mortgage loans we estimate that imposing an 80% LTV ceiling would increase the cost of credit by 17-26 basis points and weaken the loan growth rate by 40 basis points, approximately. Complementing LTV restrictions with policies that restrict the use of bridge loans is important if this tool is to be used to limit the buildup of financial risk."

We construct these indexes using information from two versions of the Household Expenditure Survey: that obtained for the period 1996-1997 and for the period 2006-2007. We show that the official CPI is a fairly good representation of the prices faced by the eighth and seventh income decile agents (first income decile is the poorest, tenth income decile is the richest). CPI shows a decreasing ability to represent the cost of life as the distance to the seventh and eighth decile increases. In particular, the poorest and richest people are the worst represented by the CPI. We also show that the inflation faced by different income groups has important similarities, but also some remarkable differences. For instance, while all income groups display a monthly inflation rate around 0.25 percent, the standard deviation of the lowest income group annual inflation is 45% higher than that of the richest group. More importantly, we show that different income groups face either permanent or very persistent gaps in their price indexes, indicating that differences across income groups may take a long time to dissapear."

This probability corresponds to the number of times when a candidate model has a strictly greater number of coefficients than the true model, divided by the total number of searches. The results indicate that the increased risk of overfitting is obtained with the AIC, followed by HQ and finally the BIC. The highest probability of overfitting is achieved with the AIC, reaching 32 and 30% with the exchange rate and Imacec, respectively, followed by 25 and 22% for total and core inflation. Considering the three IC, it is more likely to obtain an overfitted model by just one coefficient. Also, it is more likely that the overfitting does not exceed 10 coefficients. These results are important as quantifying the extent to which these variables are subject to overfitting risk when represented by AR models. The potential problems carried by overfitting includes: (i) the spurious regression, (ii) distort the estimation of impulse response function, and (iii) affect the predictive accuracy of the variable of interest.

In this paper we propose a measure of vulnerability that differentiates between countries that have experienced this compensatory effect, and thus are more resilient to changes in external financing, and those that are more vulnerable, where declines in foreign capital inflows lead to current account adjustments. Then, we compare the impact on GDP growth and real exchange rates during episodes of strong capital flow fluctuations in both resilient and vulnerable economies. In the case of surges of capital inflows, we find that vulnerable economies experience higher increases in economic growth and real exchange rate appreciations compared to more resilient ones, while during sudden stops, they suffer higher exchange rate depreciations. In addition, we explore policy and structural determinants of our metric of vulnerability to external financing. We find that economies that are less financially open and have lower credit rating and net foreign assets tend to be more vulnerable to reversions of foreign investment."

This phenomenon is examined quantitatively using a small open economy model with a commodity-producing sector and the assumption that agents have imperfect information and learn about the persistence of commodity price shocks. A central prediction of the model is that during a persistent commodity price increase, agents believe at first that this increase is temporary but eventually revise their expectations upward as they are surprised by higher than forecasted commodity price levels. Domestic investment therefore expands in a gradual way driven by investment in the commodity sector, while domestic savings decrease such that the current account declines over time. The model is estimated with data for Chile, and the results show that through the above mechanism the model explains several stylized facts regarding the recent evolution of the Chilean economy, including part of its step-wise current account reversal since the mid-2000s. Additionally, we use the model to analyze the effects of a persistent commodity price shock under alternative monetary and fiscal policies."

We show sound in-sample and pseudo out-ofsample evidence indicating that these international factors do help forecast Chilean inflation at several horizons. Incorporating the international factors reduce the Root Mean Squared Prediction Error of pure univariate SARIMA models statistically speaking. We also show that the predictive pass-through from international to local inflation has increased in the recent years. As a final exercise we construct another international inflation factor as an average of the inflation of fifteen countries from which Chile gets a high percentage of its imports. With the aid of this factor the models outperform our univariate benchmarks but also underperform the results obtained with the broader factors built with LA or OECD countries, suggesting that imported inflation is not the only channel explaining our findings."

We find that the presence of financial frictions increases the importance of foreign shocks in explaining consumption, inflation, the policy rate, the real exchange rate and the trade balance.

The behavior of the real exchange rate and its interaction with the financial frictions is key to understand the results."

Due to the shortcomings of the traditional fixed-base methods, many countries have adopted chain-linking to avoid price structure obsolescence. This has meant that GDP’s well-known accounting identities hold only approximately raising challenges for those reading the numbers, but also for forecasters that follow approaches that rely on these accounting properties. Oddly enough, the issue of aggregation is hardly mentioned in forecasting. This omission could be the result of everybody adopting the chain-linking methodology with ease and considering it unnecessary to make a point out of it, but it could also originate from ignoring the issue altogether. Whatever the reason for this omission, it could lead practitioners that are unfamiliar with the method to make unnecessary mistakes. This document presents explicitly the role of prices in a bottom-up forecasting framework and, based on it, argues that they should be taken into account when generating aggregate forecasts based on the accounting identities. Also, something that should be taken into consideration by practitioners is that discrepancies due to aggregation inaccuracy are not necessarily negligible."

The first contribution is a sharp analytical characterization of the dynamic REE equilibrium and its comparative statics. Second, we show that the nonlinearity of the bond payoff in the environment with dispersed information and limits to arbitrage leads to underpricing of corporate debt and to spreads that over-state the probability of default. This underpricing is most pronounced for high investment grade, short maturity bonds. Third, we calibrate to the empirical data on the belief dispersion and show that the model generates spreads that explain between 16 to 42% of the empirical values for 4-year high investment grade, and 35 to 46% for 10-year, high investment grade bonds. These magnitudes are in line with empirical estimates linking bond spreads to empirical measures of investor disagreement, and substantially higher than most structural models of credit risk.

 """,2014.,RER Appreciation After the Great Recession: Misalignment or Fundamental Correction?,"718, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper addresses three policy questions related to the episodes of real exchange rate (RER) appreciation in the aftermath of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. First, we determine the extent to which recent movements in RER, in several countries, are driven by changes in RER determinants (fundamentals) and correction of past misalignments or if they constitute a movement away from equilibrium (i.e. a misalignment itself). Second, we quantify the importance of non-fundamental variables such as the interest rate differential, the rate of growth of foreign reserves and credit growth in affecting the RER short-run dynamics. Third, we assess the impact of the exchange rate regime on the RER speed adjustment, distinguishing between emerging and developed economies. We conclude that countries that experienced a significant RER appreciation, in the aftermath of the 2009 crises, were undervalued before the crisis hit. In this context, movements in the RER after the crisis were driven by correction of past misalignments as well as a reaction to movements in economic fundamentals. Finally, emerging economies with less flexible exchange rate regimes show a slower speed of RER adjustment towards its long-run equilibrium."

To provide an answer to this question, we extend the standard New Keynesian macroeconomic model to include imperfect inflation control and Bayesian learning by private agents about whether the monetary authority is a committed type (capable of following through on announced plans) or an alternative type (producing higher and more volatile inflation). We find that the optimal pattern of inflation management depends critically on how skeptical the private sector is and how it views the alternative monetary authority whether the latter is just mechanically more inflationary or if it would mimic the committed monetary authority’s actions."

Then, we use a DSGE model incorporating financial frictions, heterogeneous agents and housing, which is estimated for the euro area over the period 1985 -2010, to identify the circumstances under which monetary and macro-prudential policies may have compounding, neutral or conflicting impacts on price stability. We compare inflation dynamics across four “policy regimes” depending on: (a) the monetary policy objectives – that is, whether the policy instrument, the short-term interest rate factors in financial stability considerations by leaning against credit growth; and (b) the existence, or not, of an authority in charge of a financial stability objective through the implementation of macroprudential policies that can “lean against credit” without affecting the short-term interest rate. Our main result is that under most circumstances, macro-prudential policies have either a limited or a stabilizing effect on inflation."

We also analyze how the usage of that facility by banks affected the credit they supply. We find that banks that borrowed from this facility increase commercial and consumer loans, relative to those that did not, but mortgage credit was not significantly affected. In other words, this additional source of short-term borrowing was used mainly to finance short-term lending."

Using a sample of financial crises in Emerging Market economies, we document that large inflationary spikes appear to help unemployment to get back to pre-crisis levels. However, the counterpart of inflation is sizably lower real wages. Hence, inflation does not prevent wage earners as a whole from getting hit by financial crises. Interestingly, neither the change in the real exchange rate nor the change in output composition (tradables/nontradables), from output peak to recovery point, displays a statistically significant relationship with inflation or jobless recovery. This suggests that currency depreciation can help reduce unemployment only insofar as it is associated with inflation, and that jobless recovery is likely due to nominal wage rigidity. The paper also shows that measures to reactivate credit flows could be beneficial to wage earners as a whole, as measured by the real wage bill."

We review the historical narratives on asset price booms and use a deterministic procedure to identify asset price booms for the countries in our sample. We show that “loose” monetary policy – that is having an interest rate below the target rate or having a growth rate of money above the target growth rate – does positively impact asset prices and this correspondence is heightened during periods when asset prices grew quickly and then subsequently suffered a significant correction. This result was robust across multiple asset prices and different specifications and was present even when we controlled for other alternative explanations such as low inflation or “easy” credit."

Policy affects the information about underlying fundamentals contained in aggregate outcomes, and thus affects the timing of switches and expectations of future switches. As an illustration, we study optimal taxation on labor income in an economy with coordination failures, such that wages and output are ultimately determined by agents’ “optimism” or “pessimism”. Taxes could implement a stabilization policy, but such a policy is ineffective after an expectation switch. Instead, policy should anticipate switches with small permanent tax cuts to extend ""optimism"" and severe transitory tax cuts to break ""pessimism."" These tax cuts should be reverted once a switch is triggered, when policy must focus on its short run objectives."

It develops a model with the aim of identifying the factors behind this institutional development. The model predicts that, due to asymmetric and uncertain costs, the risk of conflict leads to political institutions that poorly restrict the powers of chief executives. Since elite members cannot commit to a strong response to this type of conflicts, which in the model arise due to labor coercion, they empower the executive so he may react forcefully to conflicts. Then, in countries with a larger fraction of labor to be coerced, lower executive constraints are imposed. On the other hand, technical advance leads to higher constraints as expropriation becomes more costly. But this does not happen in countries with a large fraction of coerced labor because higher returns raise labor demand and hence larger production comes with more risk of conflict. Finally, the paper conducts an econometric exercise focusing in two factors, namely the risk of uprisings by natives and slaves, which historians have identified as an important risk for the Latin American elites at that time, and the first era of globalization that led to better economic conditions throughout the region. The results show that the dynamics of the institutional gap can be explained to a large extent by the risk of rebellion, globalization, and their interaction."

Short- and medium-term inflation expectations as well as short-term growth expectations are compared before and after the publication of a given issue of the IPoM, controlling for other factors, which may affect the expectations. These factors include Central Bank credibility, surprises in published data, and changes in the evaluation of the future interest rate, exchange rate and oil price. The results suggest that short-run inflation expectations (current year) of private forecasters are indeed influenced by the forecasts published by the central bank, mainly when these are lower and when they are published at the beginning of the year. They are also affected by surprises in published monthly inflation rates as well as by changes in the expectations for the exchange rate and monetary policy rate. The medium-term inflation expectations depend mainly on changes in short-run expectations, but oil price expectations and the future monetary policy rate also seem to matter.

Our new index allows us to include households without any transitory income in the analysis and solve the outliers’ problem underlying the standard Debt Service Ratio (DSR). The probability of layoff allows us to incorporate the uncertainty with respect to the labor status and income of the household’s head. In addition, we study the marginal probability of default for different income strata and age strata by levels of MDSR, conditional in others characteristics. We use micro-data from the Survey of Household Finances (SHF) of the Central Bank of Chile.

In fact, we found a monotonically increasing relationship between the probability of default and the MDSR.

 """,2013.,Introducing Liquidity Risk in the Contingent-Claim Analysis for the Banks,"681, Central Bank of Chile.","Traditional approaches to assess the default risk of a bank fail to recognize their basic operations, granting loans and receiving deposits from the public. The contingent claims approach (CCA) is an extension of the Black-Scholes (1973) and Merton (1974) models that calculate the credit risk of a company by characterizing the company’s equity as a call option on its assets. Although a bank can be understood as a firm, anks receive deposits and unlike a common debt, these have to be renewed before the maturity of the assets. This paper proposes a new approach to measure the default risk of a bank based on the CCA, but it includes a stochastic distress barrier in order to capture the funding volatility of the bank. This new framework provides a method to calculate the implied volatility the bank’s assets and their corresponding distance to distress (DD) and the correlation between assets and deposits returns. This methodology is applied to the Chilean banking system in the period of 2003-2012. The results show that there was an important decrease of the DD that coincides with the increment in the funding volatility during the recent crisis."

Using a GARCH model on daily oil price data, we find that, when these events actually occur -10% frequency- the geopolitical events explain around 3/4 of daily oil returns forecasted by the model, and oil supply-side events explain 2/3. When there is no occurrence of these events, financial factors (i.e. dollar fluctuations and market risk perception changes) explain around 4/5 of the daily return of oil price forecasted in average. Variance of oil return is highly persistent and these events explain no more than 10% of the daily conditional variance on the day the events actually occur."

Interestingly, not only countries on the verge of receiving bailouts have seen their CDS prices rise, but also those from which most of the bailout financing would come, such as Germany. If in fact default probabilities of countries like Germany have risen, should we still view them as safe-havens? In particular, to what extent should we see bond yields rise (as bond prices decline) vis-a-vis CDS spreads? This paper tackles this question by estimating the dynamic responses of bond yields to changes in the CDS spreads. The second, more fundamental question is to assess if the apparent contagion from troubled countries to otherwise-healthy economies is in fact so. I address this question using the Diebold - Yilmaz spillover index methodology for CDS data. I conclude that sovereign debt from Germany, Chile and Japan are unaffected by contagion from other economies and have served as safe-haven assets during the current financial distress episode."

Roughly speaking, in half of the countries, DESARIMA-based forecasts outperform the benchmarks at long horizons. Remarkably, the forecasting accuracy of our DESARIMA models is surprisingly high in stable inflation countries, for which the RMSPE is barely higher than 100 basis points when the prediction is made 24- and even 36-months ahead."

That analysis leads naturally to the question of which types of capital flows are driving the episodes, and if debt- and equity-led episodes differ materially. After identifying debt- and equity-led episodes, we find that most episodes of extreme capital flow movements around the world are debt-led and the factors associated with debt-led episodes are similar to the factors behind episodes identified with aggregate capital flow data. In contrast, equity-led episodes are less frequent, more idiosyncratic, and differ in nature from other episodes."

Event analysis shows a systematic relationship between credit booms and a boom-bust cycle in production and absorption, asset prices, real exchange rates, capital inflows, and external deficits. Credit booms are synchronized internationally and show three striking similarities between industrialized and emerging economies: (1) credit booms are similar in duration and magnitude, normalized by the cyclical variability of credit; (2) banking crises, currency crises or sudden stops often follow credit booms, and they do so at similar frequencies in industrialized and emerging economies; and (3) credit booms often follow surges in capital inflows, TFP gains, and financial reforms, and are far more common with managed than flexible exchange rates."

The paper shows that the volatility of mutual fund investments is quantitatively driven by investors through injections of capital into, or redemptions out of, each fund, and by managers changing the country weights and cash in their portfolios. Both investors and managers respond to returns and crises, and substantially adjust their investments accordingly. These mechanisms generated large capital reallocations during the global financial crisis. Their behavior tends to be pro-cyclical, reducing their exposure to countries experiencing crises and increasing it when conditions improve. Managers actively change country weights over time, although there is significant short-run ""pass-through,"" meaning that price changes affect country weights. Consequently, capital flows from mutual funds do not seem to stabilize markets and instead expose countries to foreign shocks."

For robustness, we consider alternative methodologies for identifying reversal episodes, which seems important given the differences in incidence between identification criteria. Overall, sudden flight episodes have less economic impact than sudden stop episodes. The probability of occurrence of a sudden stop in capital inflows increases in countries that face negative external shocks, capital bonanzas or high dependence on external financing. Meanwhile, unlike sudden stop episodes, we did not find robust and statistically significant risk factors in the case of sudden flight episodes."

Using panel cointegration techniques, we assess the relevance of those variables in the determination of the RER for a wide set of countries from 1980 to 2009. Our results suggest that changes in either government transfers or public investment have an impact on the RER in emerging economies. On one hand, transfers tend to appreciate the RER because they induce an increase in the relative demand for nontraded goods. On the other, an increase in public investment generates an RER depreciation. This result can be explained by the fact that, in this case, there is an increase in the relative productivity in the nontraded sector of the economy. We also study the effect of countries’ net external assets position on the RER and find that it differs markedly between developed and developing countries: this variable has a significant effect only in the case of developing economies."

The two robust results are: (i) growth is positively affected by the stock of infrastructure assets, and (ii) income inequality declines with higher infrastructure quantity and quality. A variety of specification tests suggest that these results do capture the causal impact of the exogenous component of infrastructure quantity and quality on growth and inequality.

Capital controls are strongly associated with countries having significantly undervalued currencies. Capital controls also appear to be less motivated by worries about financial market volatility or fickle capital flows per se, but rather by concerns about capital inflows triggering an overheating of the economy – in the form of high credit growth, rising inflation and increased output volatility. Moreover, countries with a high level of capital controls, and those actively implementing controls, tend to be those that have fixed exchange rate regimes, a non-IT monetary policy framework and shallow financial markets. This evidence is consistent with capital controls being used, at least in part, to compensate for the absence of autonomous macroeconomic and prudential policies and effective adjustment mechanisms for dealing with capital flows."

 """,2011.,The Risk of Civil Conflicts as a Determinant of Political Institutions,"649, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper proposes a specific mechanism to explain differences in political institutions based on the asymmetric and uncertain costs of civil conflicts. Asymmetry implies that the net benefit of fighting an insurgency is not shared equally by members of the elite. But uncertainty implies that these benefits are more evenly distributed ex-ante. The members of the elite face a commitment problem: they would like to commit in advance to a strong response to insurgencies, but ex-post they have the incentives to block any response if the conflict mainly affects other members of the elite. One way of solving this is empowering the executive so he may react forcefully to conflicts, despite the opposition of some fraction of the elite. In the model this group has to decide on the constraints imposed on the executive. Fewer constraints lead to a higher risk of expropriation. But more constraints lead to a suboptimal response to conflicts. The main prediction is that, conditional on asymmetric and uncertain costs, the higher is the likelihood of a civil conflict in the future, the lower are the constraints imposed on the executive. The paper empirically validates this implication using two types of evidence. First, it uses a sample of former colonies that became independent after WWII and geographic variables to identify the exogenous component of the likelihood of civil conflicts at the moment of the independence. Second, the model is used to explain the political events in the Americas after independence. Countries less prone to internal conflicts were the ones that imposed more constraints on the executive during the second half of the nineteenth century."

These results are broadly consistent with the literature on investment under uncertainty with partial irreversibility, and provide preliminary evidence about possible mechanisms through which global uncertainty affects emerging markets, with corresponding implications for stabilization policy."

 """,2011.,The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks in Emerging Economies,"646, Central Bank of Chile.","A recent strand of research proposes that sudden jumps in uncertainty generate rapid drops and recoveries in real macroeconomic variables that drive the business cycle. Using an empirical model, we find substantial heterogeneity in the reactions to these shocks across countries. In comparison to the U.S. and other developed countries, emerging economies suffer much more severe falls in investment and private consumption following an exogenous uncertainty shock, take significantly longer to recover, and do not experience a subsequent overshoot in activity. We provide evidence that the dynamics of investment and consumption are correlated with the depth of financial markets. Once we control for the potential role of credit constraints, we find that investment and consumption dynamics in emerging economies are similar to those in developed economies. In this context, monetary and fiscal policy actions that alleviate the impact of credit constraints facing firms and households may reduce the impact of uncertainty shocks in these economies."

A first result is that the business cycle has procyclical effects on different types of credit (i.e., consumer, commercial and mortgage loans). The results area obtained through the identification of structural shocks of VAR models that empirically replicate the standard transmission mechanism of monetary policy that has been found in previous work on the Chilean economy. However, our evidence points to new results. Periods of economic expansion trigger in the medium term, first, an increase in non– performing loans, and then, a decline in credit. We interpret this phenomenon as excessive risktaking. Similarly, periods of economic contraction and high interest rates are followed by a drop in non–performing loans in the medium term and then by a credit expansion. Finally, unexpected increases in non–performing loans can also produce contractionary effects, a rise in inflation by increasing credit risk and financial costs for firms."

We consider the problem of a benevolent government that signs a risk-sharing contract with the rest of the world, and that has to choose optimally distortionary taxes on labor income, domestic debt and international debt. Both the home country and the rest of the world may have limited commitment, which means that they can leave the contract if they find it convenient. The contract is designed so that, at any point in time, neither party has incentives to exit. We define a small open emerging economy as one where the limited commitment problem is active in equilibrium. Conversely, a small open developed economy is an economy with full commitment. Our model is able to rationalize two stylized facts about fiscal policy in emerging economies: i) the volatility of tax revenues over GDP is higher in emerging economies than in developed ones; ii) the volatility of tax revenues over GDP is positively correlated with sovereign default risk."

 """,2011.,Contracting Institutions and Economic Growth,"643, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper studies the effects of contracting institutions on economic development. A growth model is presented with endogenous incomplete markets, where financial frictions generated by the imperfect enforcement of contracts depend on the future growth of the economy, which determines the costs of being excluded from financial markets after defaulting. As the economy approaches its balanced growth path, frictions and their effect on income become more important because the net benefits of honoring contracts decrease. Therefore, as the economy approaches its steady state, the effect of contracting institutions on GDP per capita increases. This effect is due not only to a slower accumulation of capital, but also to a misallocation of resources toward labor-intensive productive sectors, where self-enforcing incentives are stronger. To validate the model empirically, the paper modifies previous specifications of cross-country regressions to estimate the effect of contracting institutions on per capita GDP. In line with the main predictions of the model, the econometric evidence shows that this effect is larger in economies that were relatively close to their steady states in 1950. Unlike contracting institutions, the evidence shows that property-rights institutions, included in an extension to the model, have an effect on income per capita throughout the development process."

The evidence shows that output volatility has dramatically decreased over the last twenty years, and the contribution of copper price fluctuations to output volatility has also declined. Moreover, the real exchange rate has acted as a shock absorber, and although during the last decade its short-run volatility has increased, its longrun volatility has remained stable and more recently has slightly declined. The decliningimpact of copper prices on the business cycle is due to macroeconomic policies.

In doing so, we analyze the cyclical properties of labor market variables and use a structural vector autoregressive model to analyze the empirical responses of variables such as unemployment rate, job finding rate, sectoral employment and sectoral average labor productivity to terms of trade shocks in the case of Chile, which come from two main sources: the mining and the non-mining sector. We then develop a multi-sector model with search frictions that generates fluctuations in the unemployment rate. Using a calibrated version of this model for Chile, we analyze the ability of the model to replicate the observed responses of labor market variables to terms of trade shocks. We find that the model can predict quantitatively the effects of labor market variables to non-mining terms of trade shocks. Although the model is able to obtain responses to mining price changes qualitatively similar to what is estimated in the data, it falls short to the estimated magnitude of reduction in unemployment that follows a rise in mining prices. The presence of very high wage rigidity can help to generate a sharper fall in unemployment after a mining terms of trade rise. Finally, the model remarks a more intense sectoral labor reallocation in response to terms of trade shocks than the amount estimated in the data."

I solve a stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky prices assuming that the government cannot commit to future policy. Real government spending increases demand by boosting public consumption. Deficit spending increases demand by generating inflation expectations. I compute multipliers of government spending that calculate by how much each dollar of spending increases output. Both the deficit and the real spending multipliers can be large, but the multiplier of deficit spending depends critically on monetary and fiscal cooperation: it can be large with cooperation and zero without it. The theory suggests one interesting interpretation of why recovery measures–such as fiscal spending, exchange interventions, and large increases in the money supply–had a smaller effect on nominal demand in Japan during the Great Recession (1992-2006) than during the US's Great Depression (1929-1941). In both episodes, the short-term nominal interest rate was close to zero. The theory suggests that part of the difference can be explained by the fact that, while monetary and fiscal policy were coordinated in the US during the Great Depression, they were not in Japan during the Great Recession. The overall conclusion of the paper is that the effect of given policy actions depends crucially on the institutional setup in the economy."

Instead of resorting to Keynesian mechanisms, in our framework fiscal policy plays a role because the government provides transfers to heterogeneous households facing volatile income, albeit with an imperfect transfer technology (a fraction of transfers leak to richer households). We calibrate the model to Chile’s highly volatile government revenues derived from copper, and characterize the optimal fiscal reaction. We quantify the welfare gains vis-à-vis a balanced budget rule, and the degree of adequate fiscal countercyclicality. We also analyze simpler rules, such as the structural balance rule in place in Chile during the last decade, more general linear rules, and linear rules with an escape clause. We find that the optimal rule leads to the same welfare gain as doubling the government’s copper revenues under a balanced budget rule. Chile’s structural balance rule achieves 18% of these gains, while a linear rule with an escape clause achieves 83% of the gains. The degrees of countercyclicality of the optimal rule and the linear rule with an escape clause are similar, and much larger than those of the structural balance rule."

While both developed and emerging countries have a procyclical policy for investment expenditure, procyclicality is evident in emerging countries also for government consumption and transfers. Over the period of increasing globalization after the 1990s, these are signs of a reduction in the extent of procyclical expenditure policy in emerging countries.

An increase in tax receipts of one percent of GDP has a sizeable positive impact on the unemployment rate, and a negative impact on hours worked, labor market tightness and job finding probability. The effect on GDP is also sizeable, but somewhat in the mid range of other values found in the literature, due to the fact that we account for the difference between discretionary and automatic changes in tax revenues.

In this article we use a joint test of superior predictive ability to test this optimality condition for the term structure of several Chilean inflation forecasts coming from the following sources: Bloomberg, Consensus Economics, the Survey of Professional Forecasters and an average of selected seasonal univariate models. We do this by taking advantage of the fact that these sets of forecasts are built at different moments in time and, more importantly, using different and nested information sets. Our results indicate that the null hypothesis of optimality under quadratic loss cannot be rejected when Mean Squared Error is used to evaluate the term structure of the forecasts. Nevertheless, when the joint test is carried out to evaluate the term structure of the Mean Squared Forecasts, as suggested by Patton and Timmermann (2010), the joint test rejects the null hypothesis of optimality. Further analysis of our results reveals that this rejection is associated with a violation of an orthogonality condition that should be satisfied when forecasts are optimal. Moreover, this violation seems to stand both across different sources of forecasts and across different forecasting horizons. This suggests that there is room for improvement in the term structure of Chilean inflation forecasts."

A big advantage of deposits is that, unlike currency, they can pay nominal interest on the average balance at a very low cost. As a result, in most developed countries an increasing number of people chose debit cards to make transactions. Despite the huge impact that these cards have had on everyday life, little is known about their consequences for the optimal conduct of monetary policy. This paper contributes to the literature on optimal monetary and fiscal policy by analyzing how the presence of imperfect deposit-currency substitution affects inflationary taxation in a public finance framework. The paper presents a model where financial intermediaries supply deposits that can be used to buy goods and services. In order to produce deposits, financial intermediaries must incur a cost. It is shown that if this cost is zero, the optimal inflation tax is zero. However, in the more realistic case in which this cost is positive, the optimal inflation tax is positive whenever there are revenue needs. Furthermore, the higher the cost of producing deposits, the higher is the optimal inflation tax. These results suggest that central banks in countries with less productive financial intermediaries (implying a higher cost of producing deposits), should optimally choose to have higher inflation rates."

In particular, the paper identifies certain statistical and conceptual advantages of this measure with respect to loan loss provisions (LLP), which support this idea. First, the NPL ratio by type of credit covers a greater time span than LLP. Second, the forward-looking nature of LLP –one of its main advantages over the NPL ratio– is applicable only from 2004 onward due to various changes in Chilean reporting standards. Third, LLP is discretionary because provisioning is made on the basis of relative risk aversion of banks. Fourth, the NPL ratio produces smoother series than LLP for consumer and mortgage loans. In addition, the dynamic structure observed in both time series does not differ significantly. The econometric model estimated for the period January 1997 to June 2010 shows that the NPL ratio has statistically significant relations with macroeconomic aggregates such as the annual output growth, the short and long term interest rates, the annual inflation rate, the peso-dollar exchange rate, and the surprises in credit growth. Finally, the out-of-sample forecasts indicate differences between the actual and projected NPL ratios that are economically significant only in the case of mortgage credit. For the remaining portfolios, the evolution of this ratio during the period of July 2008 to June 2010 does not differ significantly from that predicted by the econometric model."

The main results are: it is not possible to reject linearity in the deviation of inflation from the inflation target. During the last twenty years, inflation has converged smoothly to the target without any regime switching. Finally, strong evidence is found against linearity in the unemployment rate.

We identify two main effects of anticipated inflation absent in representative agent frameworks. First, inflation stimulates saving for precautionary reasons. Hence, a higher level of anticipated inflation implies a higher capital stock in steady state, which translates into higher wages and lower taxes on labor income. This benefits poor, less productive agents. Second, inflation acts as a regressive consumption tax, which favors rich and productive agents. We calibrate our model economy to the U.S. economy and compute the optimal policy mix. We find that, for a utilitarian government, the Friedman rule is optimal even when we allow for the presence of heterogeneity and uninsurable idiosyncratic risk. Although the aggregate welfare costs of inflation are small, individual costs and benefits are large. Net winners from inflation are poor, less productive agents, while middle-class and rich households are always net losers."

 """,2011.,Stress Tests for Banking Sector: A Technical Note,"610, Central Bank of Chile.","Credit and market risks are crucial for financial institutions. In this paper we present the model used by the Central Bank of Chile to conduct the stress tests for commercial banks in Chile. Market risk uses a balance-sheet approach that is consistent with the credit risk. For exchange rate risk we consider a change in the value of the portfolio under an unexpected change in the exchange rate by X%, meanwhile the interest rate risk is computed using a model for the whole yield curve. In particular, the modeling of this risk follows Nelson and Siegel (1987). Credit risk is computed using a non-linear VAR that relates banking system aggregates (loan loss provisions, credit growth, and write-offs) with macroeconomics variables (output growth, short and long term interest rates, terms of trade, and unemployment). For each Financial Stability Report (FSR) the model is calibrated using data from 1997 to the most recent date at monthly frequency. The effect on individual banks is computed adjusting the loan loss provision and total loans of each bank with the forecast value for the system. Given that forecasts are separated by type of loans (commercial, mortgage, and consumer) then the final effect on a particular bank depend on its initial composition."

Fiscal policies were predominantly procyclical during the boom period 2003-08 but to significantly differing degrees within the sample. Countries that pursued more conservative fiscal policies during the boom were then able to implement countercyclical fiscal policies during the downturn; moreover, they reduced or maintained their fiscal vulnerability to resource shocks, while their long-term fiscal sustainability positions improved or were broadly unchanged. However, these dimensions of fiscal policy did not seem to be linked to fiscal rules or resource funds, as countries with such institutions displayed a broad range of fiscal responses to the recent cycle."

 """,2011.,"Floats, Pegs and the Transmission of Fiscal Policy","608, Central Bank of Chile.","According to conventional wisdom, fiscal policy is more effective under a fixed exchange rate regime than under a flexible one. In this paper we reconsider the transmission of shocks to government spending across these regimes within a standard new-Keynesian model of a small open economy. Because of the stronger emphasis on intertemporal optimization, the new-Keynesian framework requires a precise specification of fiscal and monetary policies, and their interaction, at both short and long horizons. We derive an analytical characterization of the transmission mechanism of expansionary spending policies under a peg, showing that the long-term real interest rate necessarily rises if inflation rises on impact, in response to an increase in government spending. This drives down private demand even though short-term real rates fall. As this need not be the case under floating exchange rates, the conventional wisdom needs to be qualified. Under plausible medium-term fiscal policies, government spending is not necessarily less expansionary in a floating regime."

 """,2011.,"A Bunch of Models, a Bunch of Nulls and Inference About Predictive Ability","607, Central Bank of Chile.","Inference about predictive ability is usually carried out in the form of pairwise comparisons between two competing forecasting methods. Nevertheless, some interesting questions are concerned with families of models and not just with a couple of forecasting strategies. An example of this would be the question about the predictive accuracy of pure time-series models versus models based on economic fundamentals. It is clear that an appropriate answer to this question requires comparing families of models, which may include a number of different forecasting strategies. Another usual approach in the literature consists of comparing the accuracy of a new forecasting method with a natural benchmark. Nevertheless, unless the econometrician is completely sure about the superiority of the benchmark over the rest of the methods available in the literature, he/she may want to compare the accuracy of his/her new forecasting model, and its extensions, against a broader set of methods. In this article we present a simple methodology to test the null hypothesis of equal predictive ability between two families of forecasting methods. Our approach corresponds to a natural extension of the White (2000) reality check in which we allow for the families being compared to be populated by a large number of forecasting methods. We illustrate our testing approach with an empirical application comparing the ability of two families of models to predict headline inflation in Chile, the US, Sweden and Mexico. With this illustration we show that comparing families of models using the usual approach based on pairwise comparisons of the best ex-post performing models in each family, may lead to conclusions that are at odds with those suggested by our approach."

However, a large fraction of high school graduates do not enroll in college. I reconcile the observed high average returns to schooling with relatively low attendance rates when considering college as a risky investment decision. A high dropout risk has two important effects on the estimated average returns to college: selection bias and risk premium. In order to explicitly consider the selection bias, I explore the dropout risk in a life-cycle model with heterogeneous ability. The risk-premium of college participation accounts for 21% of the excess returns to college education for highability students and 19% of the excess return for low-ability students. Risk averse agents are willing to reduce their return to college in order to avoid the dropout risk. The effect is not uniform across ability levels."

We explore the role of several factors and we use three different indicators of export concentration. We find robust evidence across specifications and indicators that trade openness induces higher specialization. In contrast, financial development does not seem to help countries to diversify their exports. Looking at the effects of exchange rates, in some of our results we find a positive effect of real exchange rate volatility on concentration, but not significant effects of exchange rate overvaluation. We also find evidence that human capital accumulation contributes positively to diversify exports and that increasing remoteness tends to reduce export diversification. We also explore the role of terms-of-trade shocks. Most of our results suggest an interesting interaction between this variable and human capital: improvements in the terms of trade tend to concentrate exports, but this effect is lower for those countries with higher levels of human capital. This evidence suggests that countries with higher education can take advantage of positive terms of trade shocks to increase export diversification."

 """,2011.,A Solution to Fiscal Procyclicality: the Structural Budget Institutions Pioneered by Chile,"604, Central Bank of Chile.","Historically, many countries have suffered a pattern of procyclical fiscal policy: spending too much in booms and then forced to cut back in recessions, thereby exacerbating the business cycle. This problem has especially plagued Latin American commodity-producers. Since 2000, fiscal policy in Chile has been governed by a structural budget rule that has succeeded in implementing countercyclical fiscal policy. The key innovation is that the two most important estimates of the structural versus cyclical components of the budget – trend output and the 10-year price of copper – are made by expert panels and thus insulated from the political process. Chile’s fiscal institutions could usefully be emulated everywhere, but especially in other commodityexporting countries. This paper finds statistical support for a series of hypotheses regarding forecasts by official agencies that have responsibility for formulating the budget. 1) Official forecasts of budgets and GDP in a sample of 33 countries are overly optimistic on average. 2) The bias toward over-optimism is stronger the longer the horizon 3) The bias is greater among European governments that are politically subject to the budget rules in the Stability and Growth Pact. 4) The bias is greater at the extremes of the business cycle, particularly in booms. 5) In most countries, the real growth rate is the key macroeconomic input for budget forecasting. In Chile it is the price of copper. 6) Real copper prices mean-revert in the long run, but this is not always readily perceived. 7) Chile’s official forecasts are not overly optimistic on average. 8) Chile has apparently avoided the problem of official forecasts that unrealistically extrapolate in boom times. The conclusion is that official forecasts, if not insulated from politics, tend to be overly optimistic and that the problem can be worse when the government is formally subject to a budget rule. The key innovation that has allowed Chile in general to achieve countercyclical fiscal policy, and in particular to run surpluses in booms, is not just a structural budget rule in itself, but rather the regime that entrusts to panels of independent experts the responsibility for estimating the extent to which contemporaneous copper prices and GDP have departed from their long-run averages."

 """,2010.,Chile’s Structural Fiscal Surplus Rule: a Model – Based Evaluation,"602, Central Bank of Chile.","The paper analyzes Chile’s structural surplus fiscal rule in the face of shocks to the world copper price. Two results are obtained. First, Chile’s current fiscal rule performs well if the policymaker (i) puts a premium on avoiding excessive volatility in fiscal instruments, and (ii) puts a relatively small weight on output volatility relative to inflation volatility in his/her objective function. A more aggressive countercyclical fiscal rule can attain lower output volatility, but there is a trade-o¤ with somewhat higher inflation volatility and much higher instrument volatility. The ranking of instruments between government spending and labor income taxes depends mainly on the instrument volatility the policymaker will tolerate. Second, given its then current stock of government assets, Chile’s adoption of a 0.5% surplus target starting in 2008 was desirable because the earlier 1% target would have required significant further asset accumulation that could only have been accomplished at the expense of greater volatility in fiscal instruments and therefore in macroeconomic variables."

We review recent theoretical contributions, and illustrate the main differences between price-level targeting and inflation targeting in a simple New Keynesian model. We conclude that, contrary to conventional wisdom, price-level targeting can, in some circumstances, deliver better outcomes than inflation targeting. Its main advantage lies on the fact that it acts as a commitment device when the Central Bank is unable to commit to its future actions. However, even in the circumstances under which price-level targeting performs better, there are three caveats to be considered. First, a higher proportion of backward-looking price setters reduces the effectiveness of price-level targeting, because it weakens the expectational channel through which price-level targeting operates. Second, communicating a price-level target may be a difficult task for the Central Bank. Finally, price-level targeting itself is not immune to considerations of time-inconsistency."

 """,2010.,Is Previous Exporting Experience Relevant for New Exports?,"599, Central Bank of Chile.","Recent models of international trade show that trade costs are important determinants of exporting decisions and productivity dynamics. By assuming that these costs are exogenous and constant across firms, these theories do not take into account that experienced firms may have lower trading costs or that new exporters may reduce these costs by observing the decisions of other exporters. This study argues that firms with previous experience exporting a product to a particular market are more likely to start exporting the same product to another market, or a different product to the same market. The paper also contends that the previous experience of other exporters can significantly influence a firm’s decision to introduce a new product to a new market. Using a firm-level dataset from Chile with information on exports by product and destination market, the paper finds that an increase in the cumulative value exported by a firm increases the probability that the firm will export a previously exported product to a different market or a different product to a market to which the firm already exported a product. The results also show that an increase in the cumulative value exported of a product, or to a foreign market, by other exporters raises the probability that firms will export new products and/or to new markets. Our findings are consistent with the idea that previous exporting experience may help reduce the firm’s entry costs to international markets. The rich dataset used in this study allows the identification of these effects controlling for various time-varying observed and unobserved characteristics which may create a spurious correlation between firms’ export decisions, their previous exporting experience, and the export activity of other exporters"

The model is calibrated to match schooling patterns and labor market outcomes for the 1979 and 1997 NLSY cohorts. I explicitly model and quantitatively estimate the effect of four potential driving forces to explain the observed changes: The increase in the college wage gap, the change in the allocation of grants and scholarships, the increase in educational costs, and the changes in the ability and family income distribution. Finally, I explore alternative educational policies and their effect on different population groups."

In light of these facts, this paper develops and estimates a non-monetary DSGE model under financial autarky for international trade of goods and services between Chile and the U.S. In this context, the higher volatility of the real exchange rate is explained by the existence of transaction costs and varying degrees of imperfect substitution in consumption between home and foreign goods which endogenously induce a home bias effect. The results reveal that the estimated transaction costs and the asymmetric home bias effect content in the data would be responsible for the low correlation between consumption in both countries and the higher real exchange rate fluctuations. Finally, the model is able to replicate much of the stylized facts observed in the data, but fails to address the Backus- Smith puzzle."

The in-sample analysis indicates statistically significant improvements when more IMACEC data of the quarter are available.

The main features identified are primarily related to the development dynamics of these markets, such as a stronger presence of traditional banking in financial intermediation, marginally relevant structured finance markets and derivative products operations of a less diverse and complex nature. In the particular case of the Chilean economy we also analyze idiosyncratic factors such as, for instance, the consolidation of a selective demand driven by institutional investors. Regarding the regulatory issues analyzed, we argue that the basic set of tools available, for either advanced or emerging economies, tends to lose effectiveness in the face of the highly complex financial interactions observed in some of the advanced economies most affected by the crisis. Finally, based on this latter argument, we propose some topics for discussion that could contribute in the development of the financial system in Chile; such as expanding the reach of supervision and regulation, moving towards a consolidated supervision scheme and reducing potential procyclicalities in the available prudential regulation tools."

In this paper we show that the financial accelerator mechanism, analyzed by Bernanke, Gertler and Gilrchrist (1999), combined with adaptive learning can amplify business cycle fluctuations significantly as the balance sheet channel interacts with the presence of endogenous asset price “bubbles”. These large business cycle fluctuations are amplified in a non-linear way by the size of the shocks and by the degree of financial fragility in the economy determined by its leverage. Our preliminary results indicate that even in the presence of endogenous bubbles, responding aggressively to inflation reduces output and inflation volatility. If the central bank adjusts its policy instrument in response to asset price fluctuations, it may reduce output volatility and even inflation volatility in the short run. However, that monetary policy conduct leads to a surge in inflation several periods after the shocks. A policy that aggressively responds to changes in asset prices may marginally reduce output volatility with respect to a policy that reacts aggressively to inflation, but also at the cost of generating inflationary pressures."

For formal inflation targeters (IT) a natural question arises about whether IT frameworks were flexible enough to address this unprecedented policy environment. In this paper we tackle this question by assessing the policy responses to the crisis of nine IT central banks that did not face systemic problems in their banking or financial systems. We first document substantial deviations of actual policy responses from prescriptions of conventional monetary policy reaction functions, beginning in the second half of 2008. Although several explanations for the deviations are offered, highlighting the extreme challenges at the time, we can more easily reconcile the findings with a decline in the persistence of monetary policy, again, in all cases. Second, we document the banks’ non-monetary-policy measures adopted at the time, and estimate their impact on local money markets (both in local currency and US dollars) and on exchange rates. While these measures helped broadly to normalize markets, firm conclusions on the effectiveness of specific measures are elusive, owing to the difficulty in comparing the different mix of measures adopted across countries and the significant heterogeneity in specific economies’ responses to these non-monetary policy measures."

I argue that sectoral differences in regulation affecting the degree of competition in labor and goods markets explain: (a) the rise in the services sector share of output and employment, (b) international differences in cross-sector structure, and (c) changes in relative wages among sectors. Using evidence on market imperfections, I calibrate a two-sector model where household unions bargain with firms for wages. The least competitive sector pays higher wages, and employment is restricted accordingly. The model produces time series consistent with the “service revolution” as experienced in the Unites States and European economies between 1950 and 2000. In particular, while generating changes in shares of output and employment, the model offers an explanation for relative wage differences, which the standard literature fails to capture."

We argue that, by opening the U.S. and Canadian markets to Mexican goods, NAFTA made it easier for domestic producers to take advantage of the opportunities brought by the depreciation of the real exchange rate. To identify this mechanism, we use plant-level data and compare the behavior of employment, production and investment after two big real exchange rate shocks: the first observed in the mid 1980s, the second the Tequila Crisis of 1994-1995. The evidence indicates that after passage of NAFTA exporting firms exhibited higher growth rates of employment, sales, and investment vis-à-vis non-exporters. We confirm our results by analyzing the behavior of a control group of firms, that had complete access to the U.S. market during both devaluations, and we show that they responded in a similar way in both events. Finally, we also provide direct evidence on the relationship between exports and tariff reductions brought about by NAFTA.

Specifically, we find underborrowing in a production economy with our baseline calibration, but overborrowing with more impatient agents and more volatile shocks. Endowment economies display overborrowing regardless of parameter values, but they do not allow for policy intervention when the constraint binds (in crisis times).

 """,2010.,"Fiscal Deficits, Debt, and Monetary Policy in a Liquidity Trap","581, Central Bank of Chile.","The macroeconomic response to the economic crisis has revived old debates about the usefulness of monetary and fiscal policy in fighting recessions. Without the ability to further lower interest rates, policy authorities in many countries have turned to expansionary fiscal policies. Recent literature argues that government spending may be very effective in such environments. But a critical element of the stimulus packages in all countries was the use of deficit financing and tax reductions. This paper explores the role of government debt and deficits in an economy constrained by the zero bound on nominal interest rates. Given that the liquidity trap is generated by a large increase in the desire to save on the part of the private sector, the wealth effects of government deficits can provide a critical macroeconomic response to this. Government spending financed by deficits may be far more expansionary than that financed by tax increases in such an environment. In a liquidity trap, tax cuts may be much more effective than during normal times. Finally, monetary policies aimed at directly increasing monetary aggregates may be effective, even if interest rates are unchanged."

In some countries, taxes alone cannot or likely will not fully fund projected pension and health care expenditures. If economic agents place sufficient probability on the economy hitting its ”fiscal limit” at some point in the future, after which further tax revenues are not forthcoming, it may no longer be possible for “good” monetary policy—behavior that obeys the Taylor principle—to control inflation or anchor inflation expectations. In the period leading up to the fiscal limit, the more aggressively that monetary policy leans against inflationary winds, the more expected inflation becomes unhinged from the inflation target. Problems confronting monetary policy are exacerbated when policy institutions leave fiscal objectives and targets unspecified and, therefore, fiscal expectations unanchored. In light of this theory, the paper contrasts monetary-fiscal policy frameworks in the United States and Chile."

The underlying structural model incorporates key structural features of Emerging Market economies, notably the role of a bank-credit channel. We find that interest rate changes have swifter effects on output and inflation in both countries compared to advanced economies and that exchange rate dynamics plays an important role in monetary transmission, as currency movements are highly responsive to changes in policy-controlled interest rates. We also find the typical size of credit shocks to have large effects on output and inflation in the two economies, being stronger in Chile where bank penetration is higher."

The competition-stability trade-off is characterized and the implications of the analysis for regulation and competition policy are derived. It is found that optimal regulation may depend on the intensity of competition."

However, after the dramatic falls in industrial production in countries such as Japan and Germany starting in the last quarter of 2008, it became clear that the origins of the crisis were deeper. This paper argues that there was an economic crisis that was due to the bursting of a property and stock bubble in the US and a number of other countries. Just as in Japan in the 1990's, this greatly affected the real economy. The problems in the financial system were a symptom rather than a cause, but there was a strong feedback effect into the real economy. The structure of the global financial system and the nature of banking regulation have been severely inadequate. The paper suggests reforms in the structure of the IMF, the governance of central banks and the form of banking regulation."

Previous research in this area suggests financial and personal variables that can help estimate individual and group probabilities of default. We study mortgage and consumer default separately, as the default decisions and overall borrower behavior are different for each type of debt. Our study finds that income and income-related variables are the only significant and robust variables that explain default for both types of debt. Demographic or personal variables are specific to one or the other type of debt but not to both. For example, level of education is a factor that affects mortgage default, whereas the determinants of consumer debt default include the age of the household head, and the number of people within the household that contribute to the total family income. We derive threshold probabilities of default for each type of debt and compare them to those obtained from results of previous work based on the same Chilean data, but with a different approach. We find that the probability of default decreases as the family income increases, and that our estimates are consistent with other studies similar to ours. Also consistently with previous research, we find that, in terms of the distribution of debt and default risk, the largest portion of the country’s household debt is in the hands of families in the upper quintiles, who have the lowest risk of default. This implies that the overall financial system should be relatively stable, even in the face of moderate macroeconomic shocks."

The results of this study demonstrate that the modeled risk premium satisfies the required Fama’s conditions, and its inclusion in an extended GARCH(1,1) model is significant in explaining both the mean and the volatility of the exchange rate. However, consistently with the extant literature, the estimated risk premium does not preclude the presence of the forward premium anomaly.

Our approach defines the banking system as a portfolio of banks and infers the system’s multivariate density (BSMD) from which the proposed measures are estimated. The BSMD embeds the banks’ default inter-dependence structure that captures linear and non-linear distress dependencies among the banks in the system, and its changes at different times of the economic cycle. The BSMD is recovered using the CIMDO-approach, a new approach that, in the presence of restricted data, improves density specification without explicitly imposing parametric forms that, under restricted data sets, are difficult to model.

Finally, economic freedom and ethnic homogeneity are beneficial to growth, while democracy may have a slight negative effect."

This phenomenon is known as propagation of inflationary shocks and is the subject investigated in the present paper. It is argued that structural VAR models, with an imposed Cholesky decomposition, are suitable for the propagation analysis when the data vector includes the component affected by the initial shock and the rest of the CPI basket. The empirical analysis with annual Chilean inflation rates suggests that the propagation effects have generally diminished after the implementation of the inflation-targeting regime in September 1999. Propagation of shocks to the division including food prices, however, has increased, albeit with a delay of four months. An analysis of propagation of energy and food price shocks in seven industrialized and four Latin-American countries suggests that the effects in Chile are amongst the largest and, in the case of energy price shocks, with the longest duration."

Consistent with a model of oligopolistic competition, neither can we discard the hypothesis that the rapid expansion of the department stores’ credit services is in part due to the banking industry’s little interest in extending their credit service, at least during the early years, to lower-income customers because of the externality that this would have imposed on existing customers. The available data makes it impossible to rank the importance of all these factors partly because they work together."

To address those issues, we use a large panel dataset with quarterly information of Chilean firms during the period 1996 through 2009. In line with some previous empirical evidence, our findings show that leverage, banking debt, liquid assets, size and volatility affect cash holdings. We also find that liquidity crises have had an overall negative and economically significant effect on the firms’ cash holdings and this effect varies across firm size. In addition, our results reveal other important component of heterogeneity across firms: we find that medium-sized firms are less capable of adjusting cash holdings than do small and large firms."

The objective is to investigate the relevance of the Ricardian Equivalence Proposition (REP) in a framework where two large open economies interact and a fraction of the consumers is financially constrained. According to an estimated vector autoregressive model, a positive shock in government expenditure leads to an increase in private consumption (at odds with the permanent income hypothesis). The channels are studied in a fully microfounded dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model economy calibrated for the Euro Area (EU-12) and for the United States. The crucial parameter that drives the break of the REP is the share of financially constrained consumers. Firms produce tradable varieties in a monopolistic competition framework and pricing is à la Calvo, which leads to nominal price stickiness. Labor varieties are immobile across countries and are demanded in an aggregated fashion by firms. Fiscal policy is specified as a time-consistent rule. We simulate through impulseresponse functions parameterizations that yield results consistent with the REP, and estimate a subset of deep parameters employing Bayesian techniques."

Additionally, it is intended to determine whether the evolution of this indicator has been associated to a higher degree of risk taking. A novelty of our approach is to consider loan loss provisions as part of the total cost function for bank credit generation. The evolution of the Boone indicator shows a low level of competition between 2003 and 2005. In 2006, competition increased strongly, recovering levels statistically similar to those in the beginning of the period of analysis. This might originate in the development of those banks associated to the retail sector and consumer units of traditional banks, as well as in a process of more aggressive incursion of banks in lower-income customer segments (known as “bancarización”). The relationship between credit risk and competition in this segment of credit is not stable in time. Estimations show that, in the period of the highest increase in competition, the relationship between the Boone indicator and the non-performing loans index is negative and statistically different from zero, which indicates that the rise in competition was indeed associated to higher risk taking."

In addition, the results are robust to different calibrations of the model.

The working hypothesis is that such an effect may be produced either by the issuance or by unanticipated changes of that. Interest rates are assumed to follow an autoregressive process, where changes and some events would affect his path. In order to capture that dynamic, we estimate a VAR model with exogenous variables representing the bond market events and excess demand in the auctions. The results indicate that unanticipated changes in financial policy, measured as changes in the monthly announced quota, have a significant and persistent impact, especially on the 10- year interest rate. Furthermore, the relationship between demand and supply, measured as the inverse of the bid-to-cover ratio, has a significant effect. An analysis on the stability of the parameters shows that the financial crisis of 2008 generated significant instability.

Implementation uncertainty arises whenever the politician is unable to guarantee a positive outcome from a policy implementation. Using a political agency model where two groups of voters delegate to a politician the decision to implement reform or maintain the status quo of the economy, we show that both implementation uncertainty and electoral uncertainty affect policy implementation in different ways. Implementation uncertainty might introduce disagreement between voters about the (ex-ante) convenience of implementing the project. On the other hand, with electoral uncertainty in the political system, political power may be detached from the group’s relative size, thus linking it to the citizens’ probability of being the decisive vote. In short, a highly disciplined minority group could gather enough political power to impose their preferred policies over a less disciplined majority group."

Crucial features of that framework include: strengthening the macroprudential orientation of financial regulation and supervision; addressing more systematically the procyclicality of the financial system; relying as far as possible on automatic stabilizers rather than discretion, thereby lessening the burden on the real-time measurement of financial stability risks; and setting up institutional arrangements that leverage the comparative expertise of the various authorities involved in safeguarding financial stability, not least financial supervisors and central banks."

 """,2009.,Institutional Bias Towards The Status Quo,"543, Central Bank of Chile.","Some societies appear to be better equipped than others to implement efficiency enhancing policy reforms and to deliver positive results out of their implementation. Our model presents an under-examined element of policy reform and institutional quality, showing how the characteristics of the political system may render citizens unable to properly reward politicians who implement new projects, thus favoring politicians who secure the status quo, albeit mediocre, of the economy. In such an environment, new policy projects are sidelined and political institutional quality remains inert. Political institutions matter because they affect the value for the politicians of staying in office. We show that societies with a suboptimal political system may present institutional bias towards the status quo. This bias arises due to the inability of the citizens to design an effective voting rule that induces politicians to implement new projects successfully."

In this paper, we apply network techniques to develop a framework for analyzing financial contagion that isolate the probability of contagion from its potential spread. Our results suggest that complex financial systems may be robust-yet-fragile in nature. Under plausible assumptions, the greater connectivity implied by new financial instruments (e.g., credit derivatives) reduces the likelihood of contagion. But the impact on the financial system, in the event of problems, can be on a significantly larger scale than before."

 """,2009.,New Framework for Measuring and Managing Macrofinancial Risk and Financial Stability,"541, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper proposes a new approach to improve the way central banks can analyze and manage the financial risks of a national economy. It is based on the modern theory and practice of contingent claims analysis (CCA), which is successfully used today at the level of individual banks by managers, investors, and regulators. The basic analytical tool is the risk-adjusted balance sheet, which shows the sensitivity of the enterprise’s assets and liabilities to external “shocks.” At the national level, the sectors of an economy are viewed as interconnected portfolios of assets, liabilities, and guarantees—some explicit and others implicit. Traditional approaches have difficulty analyzing how risks can accumulate gradually and then suddenly erupt in a full-blown crisis. The CCA approach is well-suited to capturing such “non-linearities” and to quantifying the effects of asset-liability mismatches within and across institutions. Risk-adjusted CCA balance sheets facilitate simulations and stress testing to evaluate the potential impact of policies to manage systemic risk."

Financial stability could be affected by households behaviour under stressing macroeconomic conditions. Households financial vulnerability depends on their indebtedness levels and on the fragility of their income sources to be able to fulfill their obligations. The main source of households uncertainty comes from labour income generation, which is critically determined by unemployment. Heterogeneity of indebtedness levels and of income uncertainty calls for microeconomic analysis. This paper uses panel data survival analysis to estimate the probability of job loss at the individual level. Using semiparametric methods, a significant heterogeneity is found for the impact of aggregate unemployment among individuals. Monte Carlo simulations are run to assess households financial stress and then to estimate aggregate debt at risk under high unemployment rates scenarios. Since the majority of debt is held by those with lower levels of income vulnerability, it is found that financial stability is not significantly affected by high unemployment levels."

One advantage of delegating senior lending to a single institution rather than to competitive markets is that the former would be able to reach the socially optimal solution. This would require the IMF not to intervene when the crisis is severe enough. However, a commitment device might be needed to achieve the socially optimal solution. If IMF lending were done for all shocks, the country would always be better off ex post, but lenders would be worse off when the country’s situation is either good or weak, which is consistent with empirical evidence. Anticipation of senior lending might make the country better off by preventing inefficient liquidation. However, it might actually hurt the country ex ante, and too much rescuing in the future could lead to too little lending in the present which is contrary to the moral hazard critique."

We find that every year a large number of new exporting relationships are initiated, with either new firms or existent ones that begin exporting, but the survival rate of these entries is very low and declines over time. Using unit values as a proxy for product quality, our estimations show that entry is generally associated with higher product quality. This higher product quality, however, tends to decline over time and eventually disappears three years after entry. To better identify this effect, we explore whether there are systematic differences across sectors. As expected, for sectors in which quality differentiation may be important, our findings reveal that reference-price and differentiated products show a higher price in the year of entry and it takes longer to converge to the incumbent prices. These results hold after controlling for potential sample selection bias."

The first, which makes it fluctuating, is a modification of the Pindyck (1984) model by including a variable for thermal temperature. Results indicate that the firm value can fall between 6% and 44% if the biomass decreases 1% and 20%, respectively. The second considers the reduction of the biomass itself, and belongs to a different version of the Smith (1968) model. Results here show that the same value reduction amounts to between 8% and 10% if temperature anomaly rises +1% and +8°C. Finally, estimates depend on two assumptions that rely on biological evidence: CG is a reality and temperature increases have a negative effect on the biomass."

As long as the weight placed on exchange rate smoothing is relatively small, the effects on inflation and output volatility in the event of demand and cost-push shocks are minimal. Financially vulnerable emerging economies are especially likely to benefit from some exchange rate smoothing because of the perverse impact of exchange rate movements on economic activity."

This paper uses unique evidence from the leading case of Chile to study to what extent there is domestic demand for long-term instruments. We analyze monthly asset-level portfolios of Chilean institutional investors (mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies) and compare their maturity structure to that of US bond mutual funds. Despite being thought to invest long term, Chilean asset-management institutions (mutual and pension funds) hold large amounts of short-term assets relative to US mutual funds and Chilean insurance companies. Shorttermism is not driven by lack of instrument availability or tactical behavior. Instead, it seems to be explained by the desire to minimize inflation risk and, more importantly, by manager incentives that tilt demand toward short-term instruments. Extending the maturity of emerging market debt may require reducing risk and reshaping investor incentives."

In this paper we use a multi-region DSGE model for the global economy as a simple framework to understand the global response to these shocks and the importance of the propagation to different regions. The model is equipped to jointly determine exchange rates, trade balances and commodity prices across the world. We carry out several simulations with the model. First, we consider the US slowdown and its international propagation. Second, we explore a global boom-bust cycle driven by overoptimistic forecasts for productivity and their relationship with current account rebalancing. Finally, we analyze the global economic consequences of protectionism.

A bank merger in Chile provides a quasi-experiment as it constitutes an exogenous reduction in the number of lenders for firms that were previously borrowing from both merging banks. We find that a significant percentage of firms whose number of bank relationships was reduced by the merger regain their original number of lenders. In particular, firms whose number of bank lending relationships was reduced from two to one as a result of the merger have a 23% higher probability of adding a new bank lending relationship in the five years following the merger than similar firms unaffected by the merger. Overall, we find that a reduction in firms’ number of bank lenders resulting from the merger reduced firms’ access to credit. In particular, a reduction from two to one bank lending relationships generated, on average, a 14.4% decrease in loan size for the affected companies compared to firms unaffected by the merger."

We show that this assessment, known as communicational bias or simply c-bias, contains valuable information regarding the future stance of monetary policy. We do this by comparing, against several benchmarks, the c-bias’s ability to correctly forecast the direction of monetary policy rates. Our results indicate that the CBC has (in our sample period) matched words and deeds. The c-bias is a more accurate predictor of the future direction of monetary policy rates than a random walk and a uniformly-distributed random variable. It also improves the predictive ability of a discrete Taylor-Rule-type model that uses persistence, output gap and inflation-deviation-from-target as arguments. We also show that the c-bias can provide information to improve monetary policy rate forecasts based on the forward rate curve."

We find that partial credit guarantee schemes increase the number of loans and the aggregate amount lent to small and medium size businesses. In addition, we find that credit guarantees increase the debt capacity of individual entrepreneurs, holding assets fixed. We also find that Credit Guarantees increase default rates, but the evidence suggests that this result is explained mainly by misalignment of bank incentives rather than moral hazard in the context of client practices."

While in El Salvador the RER spends more time away from the equilibrium level than the non-dollarized countries in the region, the opposite is true for Panama. We also find that inflation persistence in El Salvador is similar to that of the other countries, but smaller in Panama. This leads us to the conclusion that some degree of exchange rate flexibility helps countries to have a RER more aligned with its fundamentals. Nevertheless, a long-lived, highly credible dollarized economy, like Panama, can reduce inflation persistence to such an extent that RER misalignments are actually less frequent than in countries with more flexible exchange rate regimes."

When the central bank follows a more strict inflation targeting regime, the boom-bust pattern in major aggregate variables would be exacerbated. Finally, if the central bank attempts to sustain the real exchange rate, the perverse effects on the domestic tradable goods sector are only prevented in the short-run, but the boom-bust cycle in other variables is amplified."

It starts with a stylized model for the dynamics of development that derives a Kuznets-type relation between growth and distribution of income, determined by the quality of leadership, the policy-making process, institutions and policies. This framework is applied to Chile, identifying the features of the policy-making process and leadership that allowed for continuation of growth-enhancing reform, with a stronger focus on equity goals, since the transition to democracy. As a result of three decades of reforms, Chile has recorded a quantum leap in economic growth, which is traced down to specific reforms. Yet Chile’s equity experience is much more mixed: poverty has declined massively but income remains highly concentrated, a likely result of shortcomings in the quality of education and in labor markets. The paper reviews the major risks to the country’s future development pace and points out the main reform challenges faced by policymakers. Ten lessons from Chile’s experience close the paper."

 """,2008.,Exit in Developing Countries: Economic Reforms and Plant Heterogeneity,"506, Central Bank of Chile.","Several studies have found that plant turnover contributes to productivity growth. This evidence seems to be consistent with the idea that, by reducing protection granted to inefficient firms, economic liberalization would generate productivity gains associated with resource reallocation from less productive to more productive firms. However, little empirical work has been done directly linking economic liberalization and plant exit. This paper uses Chilean reforms to shed light on their effects on plant exit. Our econometric analysis shows that larger and more productive plants are less likely to exit. After controlling for these characteristics, we also find that exit is more likely in export-oriented industries. Moreover, we find a differential impact of economic liberalization and exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in these variables have a more significant impact on less productive and smaller plants. By industry, we find that the plants that are most affected are those in export-oriented sectors."

 """,2008.,The Dynamics of Inflation Persistence in Chile,"505, Central Bank of Chile.",We show that some standard measures of inflation persistence in Chile have increased sharply in recent years. For the sample period between August 1998 and July 2008 we found that the half life of a shock to headline inflation is about 3 years. This is much higher that the half life of about 1 year computed in previous sample periods. When considering a measure of core inflation excluding food and energy our results are even stronger: for the sample period between August 2002 and July 2008 we found that the half life of a shock to this measure of core inflation is about 4 years and a half. This is much higher that the half life of less than a year computed in previous sample periods. This increase in inflation persistence is robust to changes in the univariate specification fitted to different inflation processes.

By “robust stability” we mean stability of the rational expectations equilibrium, under discounted (constant gain) least-squares learning, for a range of gain parameters. We find that many interest-rate rules are not robust, in this sense, when operational forms of policy rules are employed. Rules are considered operational if they do not depend on contemporaneous values of endogenous aggregate variables. We consider a variety of interest-rate rules, including instrument rules, optimal reaction functions under discretion or commitment, and rules that approximate optimal policy under commitment. For some of the rules that aim to achieve optimal policy, we allow for an interest-rate stabilization motive in the policy objective. The expectations-based rules proposed in Evans and Honkapohja (2003, 2006) deliver robust learning stability. In contrast, many proposed alternatives become unstable under learning even at small values of the gain parameter."

 """,2008.,"Determinacy, Learnability, And Plausibility In Monetary Policy Analysis: Additional Results","502, Central Bank of Chile.","In contrast with recent research in monetary policy analysis which has featured a great deal of work concerning conditions for determinacy, I have argued in recent publications that least-squares (LS) learnability is a compelling necessary condition for a rational expectations (RE) equilibrium to be considered plausible. As I have demonstrated in a previous paper, in a very wide class of linear RE models, determinacy implies LS learnability (but not the converse) when individuals have knowledge of current conditions available for use in the learning process. This strong result does not pertain, however, if individuals have available, in the learning process, only information regarding previous values of endogenous variables. One task of the present paper, accordingly, is to investigate the situation that is obtained when only lagged information is available. In particular, it is shown that models that are well formulated, often (but not invariably) possess the property of E-stability and hence LS learnability if current-period information is available in the learning process, even if determinacy does not prevail. Thus plausibility of a RE solution requires both that it be learnable and that the model at hand be well formulated. A sufficient condition for both of these to hold, requiring that certain matrices have positive dominant diagonals, is introduced and considered. Unfortunately, the situation in the case of lagged information is less favorable—that is, learnability can be assured only in special cases, for which no general characterization has been found."

Recent literature has explored ways for supplementing the benchmark of rational expectations with explicit models of expectations formation that rely on econometric learning. Some apparently natural policy rules turn out to imply expectational instability of private agents’ learning. We use the standard New Keynesian model to illustrate this problem and survey the key results about interest-rate rules that deliver both uniqueness and stability of equilibrium under econometric learning. We then consider some practical concerns such as measurement errors in private expectations, observability of variables and learning of structural parameters required for policy. We also discuss some recent applications including policy design under perpetual learning, estimated models with learning, recurrent hyperinflations, and macroeconomic policy to combat liquidity traps and deflation."

For both purposes, it is important to understand how agents learn. Indeed, many studies on monetary policy focus on learning processes involving evolutive, real-time learning rules (such as adaptive learning rules). The eductive viewpoint, as illustrated in previous works, partly abstracts from the real-time dimension of learning, with the aim of more directly capturing the systems’ coordination-friendly characteristics. The paper first presents the analytical philosophy of expectational coordination underlying the eductive viewpoint. Following the review, the paper explores the differences between the traditional viewpoint and this competing viewpoint as they relate to standard monetary policy analysis. This exploration is tentative, yet promising."

The data used corresponds to a new panel based on 440 thousand wage histories for the period 2001.12-2007.12. The results indicate a low degree of wage flexibility, the estimated length of wage adjustment for the whole economy being around nine quarters. In terms of the determinants of wage rigidity, the degree of flexibility depends negatively on the size of the firm, the percentage of female workers, the age of workers and white-collar participation at firm level. The econometric estimations indicate that the direct consequence of wage rigidity is a higher fluctuation of employment through the business cycle."

 """,2008.,Choosing an Exchange Rate Regime,"494, Central Bank of Chile.","Choosing an exchange rate regime is one of the most important decisions in macroeconomic policymaking. Some countries may peg their currency to gain credibility and control domestic inflation, while others may be more prone to float due to the larger incidence of real shocks. In spite of the abundant literature on the determinants of the exchange rate regime choice, the empirical literature has been unable to produce robust results on how countries select their exchange rate arrangements. Some argue that the problems of the empirical literature may rely on: (a) the failure of traditional measures of exchange rate regimes in capturing information of the regime in force (deeds) rather than the announced regime that is self-reported by countries (words). (b) The modeling of the dependent variable: whether the issue is to model the adoption of pegs (vis-à-vis floating) or choose within a wider array of regimes. (c) The use of a comprehensive set of determinants of exchange rate regime choice that takes into account factors associated to theories of choice determination (optimum currency area theory, financial approach, among others). This paper attempts to address the issues mentioned above using a sample of 110 countries with annual information over the period 1975-2005 using de facto exchange rate regime classifications and a comprehensive set of explanatory variables. We find the following stylized facts. First, factors associated with the optimum currency area approach are good predictors of adopting pegs: countries that are smaller in size and with stronger trade linkages are more likely to peg their currencies. Second, factors related to the financial approach are consistent with the impossible trinity: countries with higher openness and higher financial development are more likely to adopt floating regimes. Finally, we find that countries with high inflation and larger external and fiscal imbalances are more prone to adopt pegs."

 """,2008.,"Learning, Endogenous Indexation, and Disinflation in the New-Keynesian Model","493, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper introduces adaptive learning and endogenous indexation in the New-Keynesian Phillips curve and studies disinflation under inflation targeting policies. The analysis is motivated by the disinflation performance of many inflation-targeting countries, in particular the gradual Chilean disinflation with temporary annual targets. At the start of the disinflation episode, price-setting firms expect inflation to be highly persistent and opt for backwardlooking indexation. As the central bank acts to bring inflation under control, price-setting firms revise their estimates of the degree of persistence. Such adaptive learning lowers the cost of disinflation. This reduction can be exploited by a gradual approach to disinflation. Firms that choose the rate for indexation also re-assess the likelihood that announced inflation targets determine steady-state inflation and adjust indexation of contracts accordingly. A strategy of announcing and pursuing short-term targets for inflation is found to influence the likelihood that firms switch from backward-looking indexation to the central bank’s targets. As firms abandon backward-looking indexation the costs of disinflation decline further. We show that an inflation targeting strategy that employs temporary targets can benefit from lower disinflation costs due to the reduction in backward-looking indexation."

For the analysis of data uncertainty, we focus on the uncertainty associated with the estimation of the output gap using real-time data and various well-known methods to estimate the output trend. We find that the revisions to the output gap are important and persistent and that the unobserved components method performs better with real-time data than with others more commonly used, like the HP filter. In the case of additive and multiplicative uncertainties, we estimate the equations that govern the behavior of the economy with time-varying parameters and with state-dependent variances in the shocks of the model. This allows us to analyze the contribution of these two types of uncertainty on the total uncertainty. We find that additive uncertainty is the most relevant to explain total uncertainty and that shocks to the model are state-dependent."

(iii) We test the sensitivity of our results to different country groups and over time. Our findings mainly show that: (a) discipline and credibility enhancing effects are crucial in lowering inflation. We find that countries that adopted either inflation targeting or fixed exchange rate regimes attain lower inflation rates. Financial openness and healthy fiscal balances also exerted a disciplinary effect on inflation in the short run. (b) Countries with higher income per capita have lower inflation rates. (c) Interestingly, domestic output gap has a positive effect that is higher in industrial countries than in developing ones. (d) We fail to find a significant effect of globalization —as proxied by the foreign output gap— on domestic inflation."

In our model, private agents are unable to distinguish between temporary shocks to the central bank's monetary policy rule and persistent shifts in the inflation target, and therefore use optimal filtering techniques to construct estimates of the future monetary policy stance. We find that the macroeconomic benefits of credibly announcing the current level of the time-varying inflation target are reasonably small as long as private agents correctly understand the stochastic processes governing the inflation target and the temporary policy shock. If, on the other hand, private agents overestimate the volatility of the inflation target, the overall gains of announcing the target can be substantial. We also show that the central bank can, to some extent, help private agents in their learning process by responding more aggressively to deviations of inflation from the target."

The foregoing is especially relevant for emerging countries like Chile, which are frequently threatened by external shocks. In addition, credit market distortions are more frequent in these economies. Using an empirical analysis for a panel data of 72 countries between 1950 and 2004, we find positive correlations between credits, R&D spending, fiscal policy, and growth. On the other hand, we find negative correlations between these variables and volatility. Testing different types of models we find very robust results, suggesting that countries with more developed domestic financial markets are in better conditions to recover growth after a shock. The same is true when countries apply fiscal policies that guarantee “fiscal discipline”."

Theoretically, the impact of trade and financial openness is ambiguous. Hence, our problem becomes an empirical one. Using a sample of 82 countries for the period 1975-2005, we find that the response of growth volatility to rising trade and financial openness depends upon some country characteristics. We find that: (a) trade openness stabilizes output fluctuations in countries with well-diversified economic structures, (b) financial openness mitigates growth volatility in countries with low debt-equity ratios, (c) domestic financial depth helps smoothing out the destabilizing effect of financial openness on growth volatility, (d) countries with higher trade openness are less prone to output drops, and (e) countries with higher financial openness are more likely to experience sharp drops in real output only if their external liabilities are more biased towards debt than equity."

Results show a moderation in productivity since the year 2000 that is common for most of the manufacturing sectors. Moreover, the evidence suggests that this moderation has been larger in more energy-intensive industrial sectors. The econometrical estimations reveal a negative statistical relationship between productivity and energy costs (or the cost of energy): estimated elasticities suggest that a 10% increase in the energy price is associated to a reduction of productivity around 1% in the short-run and 2% in the long run.

Usually, fiscal and monetary policies in industrial countries have been expansionary in response to weak domestic conditions. However, the cyclical properties of fiscal policies are a much more disputed issue among emerging market economies. Several researchers have attributed these differences in cyclical behavior to: (a) factors associated to a weak institutional framework that play a key role in explaining sub-optimal policy decisions, and (b) factors associated to weak integration (or access) to either domestic or international financial markets. The goal of the present paper is to empirically evaluate whether the ability of countries to conduct countercyclical fiscal policy is affected by the quality of their institutions and/or by the availability of financial resources either in domestic or international capital markets. Our empirical evaluation yields a more nuanced interpretation to the existing evidence: (1) countries are unable to conduct counter-cyclical fiscal policies if they have poor institutions or lack wide access to credit markets at home and abroad, and (2) institutional factors have a larger weight than financial variables in explaining the differences in cyclical behavior of fiscal policy between industrial and developing countries."

When the agency has a high degree of supervisory involvement, even with partial insurance panic runs disappear as the regulator's signal becomes more precise. However, the smaller the protection offered to depositors, the higher is forbearance. Deposit insurance induces moral hazard by increasing the equilibrium value of the demand deposit contract in the interim period, though this effect seems to be smaller under a broad mandate.

However, at the country level, most of the empirical studies assessing the R&D-productivity relationship often fail to consider the possible simultaneity of these variables. Do more productive countries invest more on R&D or does the higher level of R&D investment that leads to higher levels of productivity? Do both relationships occur at the same time? Using a 65-country panel for the time period of 1960- 2000, this study provides evidence that the relationship is mainly based on investment in R&D and not the reverse. In addition, we found that per capita R&D expenditure is strongly exogenous to productivity. These results suggest that, on average, those countries making the most effort in the R&D sector will be more productive in the future. Finally, we present evidence those points out a strong relationship between R&D and productivity in terms of both magnitude and significance."

 """,2008.,Alternative Measures of Core Inflation in Chile,"471, Central Bank of Chile.","Inflation targeting central banks usually base their objectives on headline inflation, which is often affected by price movements of specific components whose behavior makes it difficult to extract clear signals about the inflationary outlook relevant for the monetary policy horizon. For this reason, several measures of underlying (core) inflation have been proposed with the purpose of removing this “noise”. This paper presents some alternatives calculated for the Chilean economy: three different measures that trim CPI components according to criteria of price changes and volatility, and two measures that re-weight the components according to historical volatility. In general terms, we find that the measures trimming away items with extreme price changes or high volatility are informative about the inflationary outlook given that they are unbiased with respect to the seasonally adjusted CPI and superior to other measures in tracking the headline inflation trend."

The magnitude of the aggregate, sectoral and distributive impacts associated with these changes in the energy sector is debated. In this paper, using a static general equilibrium framework, we analyze quantitatively the direct and indirect effects of these international shocks. The results show that the increase in international prices of oil and fuels generates a slightly negative impact on GDP, which is explained by the recessionary effect on consumption. The sectors most adversely affected are the fuel sector, other sectors strongly linked to the energy sectors such as transport and electricity and those geared to the provision of goods and services for final consumption. The main effect on the productive structure is a strengthening of Chile’s traditional comparative advantages based on primary sectors and natural resources. Within the energy sector, coal gains participation in the energy matrix. The impacts on the income of the poorest and its distribution are clearly negative: contractionary and regressive. The former results are magnified when both natural gas supply restrictions and high hydrocarbon prices are considered together."

We work with import prices both at the border and at the wholesale level, and our results are consistent with the idea of a high ERPT— complete in the long-run—which has not declined for both pricing levels. In the shortrun, however, wholesale prices seem to be less sensitive to exchange rate variations. This may indicate the existence of a pass-through less than perfect in the distribution chain from prices at the border to its wholesale counterpart. In addition, we find weak evidence of asymmetric pass-through from appreciations versus depreciations for the aggregate import indexes. Finally, we also explore if the high and not declining ERPT is given by the fact that Chilean imports are concentrated in products with such ERPT, and our results support the view that this is not the case."

The results clearly show that the Chilean Stock Market is characterized by the presence of nonlinear patters in both series (trading volume and stock returns) as well as in their joint relationship. The presence of nonlinearities is a key issue in testing the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), according to which stock returns and trading volume should be not related.

By making use of a quarterly database of external assets and liabilities for the period 1983 to 2005, and employing a recently developed test of out-of-sample predictive ability, we show that this measure is able to predict the real exchange rate at horizons of up to 2 years. Out-of-sample evidence of predictability tends to get stronger as the size of the window used to estimate the parameters increases. This is probably because of the greater relative importance of the external balance in the dynamics of the exchange rate in the last few years, or because of the increasing precision of parameter estimates with the sample size. When we break down our measure of external imbalances into its three components: exports to imports ratio, exports to assets ratio and assets to liabilities ratio, we find that out-of-sample predictability is mainly driven by the last two ratios."

Asymptotic normality implies that more power can be achieved by finding the optimal weight in a combined t-ratio. Unfortunately, this optimal weight is degenerated under the null of no predictability. To overcome this problem we introduce a penalization function that attracts the optimal weight to the interior of the feasible combination set. The new optimal weight associated with the penalization problem is well defined under the null, ensuring asymptotic normality of the resulting combined test. We show, via simulations, that our proposed combined test displays important gains in power and good empirical size. In fact, the new test outperforms its single components displaying gains in power up to 45%.

Using a DSGE model, we compare the effects of transitory copper-price shocks under different fiscal rules. The results show that if the fiscal policy is conducted using a structural balance fiscal rule, such that the government saves most of the extra revenues from the higher copper price, then a copper price shock of 10% would increase output only by 0.05% and there would be a slight decrease in inflation. This last effect occurs due to a real appreciation of the exchange that compensates a slight increase in domestic goods inflation. In contrast, when fiscal policy is highly expansive, the same copper price increase implies an output expansion of up to 0.7%, an increase in inflation, and a real exchange rate appreciate of 0.2%. We show that the adoption of a flexible exchange rate regime would have contributed to isolate output (and inflation) from copper price shocks, although our quantification of the effect of this change in policy is small. We also show that if the structural balance fiscal rule lacks credibility, then a copper price shock would lead to much higher inflation than under full credibility."

Relatively tight domestic monetary conditions have contributed to contain inflationary pressures arising from other shocks, namely a slowdown in productivity by mid 90s. Foreign factors are also behind the large swings exhibited by the real exchange rate, although a monetary contraction in 1998 explains part of the delayed adjustment of the exchange rate in response to effects of the Asian crisis. The tight monetary policy around 1998 also contributes to the slow recovery of the employment afterwards."

It is difficult to test this hypothesis empirically due to the difficulty in measuring some of these concepts. This paper uses cost and profit functions to estimate efficiency at the bank level in Chile. Based on these measures, we explain cross-bank differences over time, which are related to bank size, ownership structure, and other relevant variables. We report two main findings. First, banks that are established as listed companies in Chile tend to show a higher level of efficiency than those established as closed companies. This result holds even after controlling for the bank’s product mix and property origin (domestic versus foreign). Our interpretation of this result is that listed banks have a relatively high probability of takeover in Chile, since the ownership structure is known. Managers therefore act in the best interest of stockholders. Second, banks that have a high property concentration demonstrate a high level of efficiency. The two results together suggest that mitigation of the principal-agent problem is key to explaining bank efficiency."

The empirical strategy involves the estimation of simple equations for GDP growth and conventional inequality measures, augmented to include among the regressors infrastructure quantity and quality indicators in addition to standard controls. To account for the potential endogeneity of infrastructure (as well as that of other regressors), we use a variety of GMM estimators based on both internal and external instruments, and report results using both disaggregated and synthetic measures of infrastructure quantity and quality. The two robust results are: (i) growth is positively affected by the stock of infrastructure assets, and (ii) income inequality declines with higher infrastructure quantity and quality. A variety of specification tests suggest that these results do capture the causal impact of the exogenous component of infrastructure quantity and quality on growth and inequality. These two results combined suggest that infrastructure development can be highly effective to combat poverty. Furthermore, illustrative simulations for Latin American countries suggest that these impacts are economically quite significant, and highlight the growth acceleration and inequality reduction that would result from increased availability and quality of infrastructure."

According to all methods, economic overheating is observed at the beginning of the sample; from 1993 until the Asian Crisis the gap is not very large but is always positive, after the Asian Crisis the gap measures show a smooth tendency to a level close to zero. In order to compare the output gaps generated under the different methodologies, we evaluate the real-time performance of the output gap measures and measure how well the output gap can help forecast future inflation. Regarding the potential output growth, the methods yield broadly similar estimations. Over the complete sample, the average potential growth rate is around 5.6%. However, there seems to be important differences across sub-periods, particularly the growth rate is below the average in the period after the 1999 recession."

If countries produce a different mix of products, however, they will have a different aggregate production function. We argue that the inclusion of a fixed factor, such as natural resources, strongly determines the pattern of production and trade, and thus the path of development (Leamer, 1987) and the level of per capita consumption of a small open economy. We build a dynamic model of comparative advantages that naturally leads to different steady-state equilibria. Our main findings are, first, that differences in income and capital per worker between countries with and without natural resources (and with different types of natural resources) are explained by the relative rent of the natural resource factor and the capital-labor ratio used in the natural resource sector relative to the other sectors. An economy that discovers a natural resource will almost alwaysenjoy a higher level of consumption in steady state, although we describe one specific case in which it is not optimal to exploit the natural resource. Second, for economies without natural resources, becoming industrialized is always good (in terms of consumption). Nevertheless, countries with natural resources could end up with a less industrialized productive sector, but a higher level of consumption."

The episode lasted from 1990 to around 1996, ending up with the outbreak of the Asian crisis in 1997–98. The current account reversals to surpluses were associated with sudden stops in capital inflows. These inflows significantly exceeded current account deficits in the first half of the 1990s; however they had not yet recovered their pre-crisis levels by 2006. The Southeast Asian sudden stop episode was also associated to sharp contractions in output that were unprecedented in Asia over the sample period. These declines in output were followed by relatively quick recoveries but permanently lower growth rates. This paper documents and analyzes the historical experience of Southeast Asian countries regarding their current account deficits. This experience illustrates how high growth rates can be associated with significant external and domestic vulnerabilities. It is suggested that for these countries’ experience, high rates of investment spending driving the current account cycle and increasing financial fragility were key determining factors."

For that, we estimate a threshold model for the CBC’s policy rule that allows the existence of two policy regimes according to whether the output gap, the inflation deviation or the GDP growth is above or below a threshold value. Also, we assess the possible effects of estimated monetary policy rules in the achievement of the inflation target by simulating a standard New Keynesian Model with endogenous switching parameters. Estimations show that the monetary authority responds strongly to inflation deviations but weakly to the output gap when the gap is larger than a specific threshold value. Furthermore, there is statistical evidence that the CBC reacts faster moving the interest rate under expansion periods. These results are robust when assuming an unknown threshold value and to real-time estimation. Simulations revealthat the estimated monetary policy rule may induce an asymmetric behavior in the inflation rate and a small negative inflation bias."

Historical experience under a fixed exchange rate regime suggested that large persistent deficits were unsustainable and could leave the economy vulnerable to sudden reversals in sentiment. These concerns persisted after the floating of the Australian dollar and financial deregulation, and it was thought that all arms of policy should help to rein in the then much larger current account deficits. However, these policies were shown to be ineffective and, by the early 1990s, the argument that current account deficits represent the optimal outcomes of decisions made by ‘consenting adults’ gained wide support. This paper presents some empirical evidence consistent with optimal smoothing in the face of temporary shocks; the persistence of the deficit is attributed to a modest degree of impatience relative to the rest of the world. Although it is now widely accepted that policy should not seek to influence the current account balance, the issue of external vulnerability remains of interest. Here, country-specific considerations are important, and it is argued that the factors that have made Australia relatively resilient to external shocks are also those that helped to attract foreign capital in the first place."

In principle, an active IRM strategy could lower real exchange rate volatility induced by terms of trade shocks; provide self insurance against sudden stops; reduce the speed of adjustment of the current account; and even allow for higher growth if it fosters exports (“mercantilist” motive). The message of the report is mixed – management of reserves is not a panacea. The mercantilist case for hoarding international reserves, as an ingredient of an export led growth strategy, is dubious. Done properly, IRM augments macro economic management in turbulent times, mitigating the impact of external adverse shocks and allowing for a smoother current account adjustment.

In the case of New Zealand, fluctuations in commodity export prices have also been important. Counterfactual experiments indicate that (i) a peso denomination of the Chilean external debt would reduce the impact of external shocks on the exchange rate and domestic variables, and the influence of monetary policy on the current account; and (ii) more or less aggressive monetary policy in New Zealand offers little scope for stabilizing the exchange rate and the current account."

We estimate the model using data from Mexico and Canada. We show that interest rate shocks orthogonal to domestic TFP fail to explain the behavior of emerging markets. We then allow for interest rates to respond to/co-vary with productivity shocks.

Previous studies have solved this problem by increasing the persistence of shocks or by lowering the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. This paper tackles it by introducing market imperfections relevant for MICs into an otherwise standard model. More specifically, we build a model with limited access to the foreign capital market, identified as an external borrowing constraint, and asymmetric financing opportunities across tradable and non-tradable sectors, identified as sector-specific labor financing wedges. The key parameters associated to these frictions are deduced to replicate selected data for Chile between 1986 and 2004. We find that the external borrowing constraint makes investment and consumption of tradable goods more procyclical and volatile, making real net exports counter cyclical. However, it produces counter cyclical employment and a low volatility of consumption of non tradable. Introducing sectorspecific labor financing wedges enables the model to reproduce these moments as well."

In this paper, we assess empirically the implications of stocks, flows and valuation adjustments in external crises (current-account reversals, sudden stops and currency crises), sovereign credit ratings and the longrun real exchange rates (RER), in both industrial and developing economies. We find support for the view that foreign assets and liabilities are rather distinctive external holdings with different implications in the occurrence of external crisis. Valuation adjustments have an impact on crises, although quantitatively not very large. Portfolio liabilities (particularly equity) increase the probability of current-account reversals and currency crises, while the likelihood of sudden stops increases with the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) assets. In the case of sovereign credit ratings, we find a noteworthy effect of the stock and flows of FDI liabilities on improving sovereign ratings. Finally, as for the RER, gross assets and liabilities appear equally important, but components of external holdings have considerably different effects. While the cumulative current account is associated with real depreciation, the valuation effect is strongly linked with real currency appreciations in developing economies."

Moreover, the paper shows that recovery after crises that exhibit large output loss (more than 5 percent of GDP from peak to trough) occurs in a Phoenix-like fashion: little credit or investment is required.

 """,2007.,On Current Account Surpluses and the Correction of Global Imbalances,"440, Central Bank of Chile.","In this paper I analyze the nature of external adjustments in current account surplus countries. I ask whether a realignment of world growth rates -- with Japan and Europe growing faster, and the U.S. growing more slowly -- is likely to solve the current situation of global imbalances. The main findings may be summarized as follows: (a) there is an important asymmetry between current account deficits and surpluses. (b) Large surpluses exhibit little persistence through time. (c) Large and abrupt reductions in surpluses are a rare phenomenon. (d) A decline in GDP growth, relative to long term trend, of 1 percentage point results in an improvement in the current account balance -- higher surplus or lower deficit -- of one quarter of a percentage point of GDP. Taken together, these results indicate that a realignment of global growth would only make a modest contribution towards the resolution of global imbalances. This means that, even if there is a realignment of global growth, the world is likely to need significant exchange rate movements. This analysis also suggests that a reduction in China's (very) large surplus will be needed if global imbalances are to be resolved."

This paper evaluates Chile’s MPH—recently redefined by the Central Bank of Chile—in light of the Chilean experience and in an international comparison with other inflation targeters around the world. We review analytical and practical aspects of the formulation of the inflation-targeting framework. Then we present descriptive information on inflation, its volatility and its deviation from the target for all inflation-targeting countries, in order to infer the actual degree of tolerance countries have had toward inflation rates’ deviation and volatility. Next we describe the current design of monetary policy in the four aforesaid dimensions of flexibility in inflation-targeting countries. Finally, we review inflation forecasts published by the Central Bank of Chile and evaluate the consistency between the announced MPH and the Bank’s actual policy horizon."

Our overall results are in line with the big picture that is by now familiar from the literature: Exporters are more productive than non-exporters when observed and unobserved heterogeneity are controlled for, and these exporter productivity premia tend to increase with the share of exports in total sales; there is strong evidence in favour of self-selection of more productive firms into export markets, but nearly no evidence in favour of the learning-by-exporting hypothesis. We document that the exporter premia differ considerably across countries in identically specified empirical models. In a metaanalysis of our results, we find that countries that are more open and have a more effective government report higher productivity premia. However, the level of development per se does not appear to be an explanation for the observed cross-country differences."

The evolution of banking aggregates over an 18-year period (1989- 2006), using quarterly data is examined. Techniques common in the real business cycle literature are applied to establish empirical patterns. Robustness tests using several filters are performed. The effects of macro shocks on banking variables are analyzed, both by means of an event study, and by estimating impulse responses with VARs. The results show that credit lags the cycle, demand deposits lead it, both being procyclical, while the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is countercyclical. In addition, a shock to interest rates reduces loans (total, commercial, consumption), and increases non-performing loans (NPL) and the capital adequacy ratio (CAR). A shock to GDP growth has a positive effect on loans and ROE, and a negative impact on NPL and CAR."

It is argued that simple decision rules based upon direct comparisons of out-of-sample Mean Squared Prediction Errors (MSPE) may be equivalent to carrying out inference with a confidence level of only 50%. In addition, following McCracken (2007) and Clark and West (2006), we provide evidence via Monte Carlo simulations, of the non-normality of the asymptotic distribution of the difference of MSPE when models are nested. This means that when comparing predictive ability against a random walk, this simple model may outperform an alternative and true data-generating process. This anomaly is called “hidden predictability” meaning that the true predictability of a time series may be hidden behind a veil of parameter uncertainty affecting the true model. “Hidden Predictability” may be detected with some recently developed tests. We illustrate the detection of this type of predictability providing examples from two previous papers that explore the ability to predict Chilean exchange rate returns"

The traditional mechanism is an increase in the interest rate that reduces pressures on prices from the demand side. Nevertheless, another possible monetary policy transmission channel exists: the cost channel. An increase in the nominal interest rate affects the cost functions of firms that borrow to pay their workers. This way the effect on the price dynamics of an increment in the interest rate seems to go in opposite direction to the traditional channel.

This is true for rises and cuts of the rate, so there is no evidence of asymmetries. Two additional interesting results are that i) the increase in the sector’s market concentration has prompted a reduction in intermediation spreads, and ii) the volatility of the market interest rate, controlling for the year 1998, generates an increase in them. Finally, it is worth noting that the sensitivity of banking spreads to the interest rate variance (that includes exchange rate depreciation and inflation in UF) has increased strongly during the nominalization period."

China exports a wide variety of products. The growth in China’s exports, however, is mainly driven by an increase in import penetration within common product categories with the rest of the world—the intensive margin—rather than by an increase in the number of product varieties exported—the extensive margin. Surprisingly, the growth in the intensive margin is explained by an increase in exported quantities without a significant fall in the relative price of Chinese varieties. This apparent paradox suggests that an increase in either the number of unobserved varieties or the willingness to pay for Chinese products—an increase in the relative quality of Chinese products—is the driving force behind China’s export performance. We present evidence regarding China’s export prices, the similarity of China’s export bundle to that of developed countries, and the relative quality of Chinese products, to conclude that improvements in the quality of Chinese products is an important dimension of Chinese export growth."

Economies may be curtailed from international financial markets, resulting in a sudden stop of inflows, but others may be experiencing portfolio shifts that cause sudden start of capital outflows. By looking at gross flows, and comparing emerging markets (EMEs) with developed economies (DEs) we indeed show that there is a variety of experiences that cannot be lumped together. In particular, sudden stop of inflows are as common in DEs as in EMEs, but a key difference is that in the former outflows and inflows are negatively correlated, which dampen the reversal of net flows.

However, there is neither a clear answer nor a consensus about its welfare consequences. On the one hand, it is argued that the moral hazard consequences of an extra lender could be strong enough to offset any positive effect of an additional source of funding. On the other hand, it is argued that moral hazard consequences could be negligible and, therefore, the second lender’s presence could be welfare improving. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it provides a numerical perspective about the welfare effect of an active second lender. Second, it sheds light on the debt dynamics in the two-lender case. The main result is that the second lender is not beneficial from a welfare standpoint for a wide range of parameters. Without coordination, the estimates imply welfare losses that range from 1.5% to 6% of GDP, depending on the severity of the second lender’s penalties. On the other hand, if a coordination mechanism is imposed, such as the second lender acting as a lender of last resort, then the model will mimic a one-lender model where the first lender is crowded out from the market. l II) could be helpful on this task."

We argue that weaker institutions increase transaction costs, including those incurred by a firm when dealing with suppliers of intermediate goods. Firms respond to these higher costs by substituting intermediate goods produced within the firm for those externally supplied, which in turn discourages specialization and consequently decreases productivity. To test this channel, we rely on differences across sectors in their capacity to substitute internal goods for intermediate goods. We first create an index that measures the 'complexity' of a sector's intermediate structure using data from the United States. Using this index, we find that industries with a more complex intermediate goods structure suffer a relatively larger loss of productivity in countries with poorer institutions. l II) could be helpful on this task."

As a by-product, this estimation yields the capital share in output and the long-term growth rate.

Countries making transitions toward low export ratios are mainly from Africa, but these countries only constitute a half of economies with bad export performance. I focus then on which structural factors may be important for long-run transitions. The results suggest that more open economies and those with better institutions are more likely to move to high export ratios in the long-run. Finally, I explore within-country experiences for identifying episodes of export transitions. Using an event study methodology, I find a very weak association between export transitions and economic growth and investment rate. In contrast, my results suggest that transitions are potentially driven by improvements in financial development.

We find that this decline is a generalized fact for a large set of countries. After documenting correlations between the consumer price index and oil prices, we use two estimation strategies in an attempt to properly identify the effect of oil shocks on inflation. First, we estimate the traditional Phillips curve augmented to include oil and test for structural breaks in 34 countries. This methodology shows a fall in the average estimated passthrough for industrial economies and, to a lesser degree, for emerging economies. Second, we estimate rolling vector autoregressions for a subsample of countries for which we have sufficient data. We derive impulse response functions of inflation to oil shocks and interpret the integrals as estimates of pass-through. We find that the effect of oil shocks on inflation has weakened for most of the 12 countries in the sample. Among the factors that might help to explain this decline, we argue that the most important are a reduction in the oil intensity of economies around the world, a reduction in the exchange rate pass-through, a more favorable inflation environment, and the fact that the current oil price shock is largely the result of strong world demand. These factors help to explain not only why the current shock has had limited inflationary effects, but also why it has had limited consequences for output."

Threshold values of the requirement in each period, for which capital regulation start affecting bank risk taking decisions, are calculated. One main lesson from this exercise is that constant capital requirements (as considered in Basel I) are indeed capable of reducing risk taking below the unregulated solution, and can even achieve the zero bankruptcy cost, socially efficient level of risk. However, that might happen for very high levels of the requirement, and at the cost of reducing financial intermediation. A second important lesson is that as the dynamic of risk depends on these thresholds, and they in turn depend upon the initial equity of the bank; knowing the latter is essential for the regulator to determine the effectiveness of capital regulation. Additional market instruments and effective monitoring and supervision (as proposed in Basel II) could be helpful on this task."

Both these definitions are in turn similar to defining the target in terms of the expected value and desired variance of inflation. All these definitions are connected by the actual process of inflation. A more volatile or persistent inflation increases the policy horizon. The paper also presents evidence on how inflation targets are actually defined in many countries and compares these stated targets with that implied by the actual process of inflation. To interpret these results, the paper presents a simple model, generalized in the appendices, to show how the central bank’s tolerance of deviations from the target, as well as the policy horizon, depend on the cost of output deviations from full employment, and on the slope and degree of backward-lookingness of the Phillips curve."

We use highly-disaggregated import data from Chile between 1990 and 2005 to decompose the causes of such export performance. We find that China’s high export growth is mainly explained by an increase in the quality of its varieties relative to those from the rest of the world, which raises world demand for its varieties as well as it increases the number of varieties produced in China. Our results show that Chinese products are cheaper than those from the rest of the world, but the small decline in their relative price has a negligible contribution to the growth of China’s penetration. There is heterogeneity across products, however. The increase in quality and the decline in product prices are more pronounced for highly-differentiated products. Because international product-price differences reflect productivity and factor cost differences, these results reveal that productivity growth has been higher in highlydifferentiated products, which coincides with the pattern of quality growth. Therefore, we conjecture that productivity growth is behind the increase in the quality of Chinese varieties as well as the raise in number of varieties produced and exported by China."

 """,2006.,Optimal Inflation Stabilization in a Medium-Scale Macroeconomic Model,"410, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper characterizes Ramsey-optimal monetary policy in a medium-scale macroeconomic model that has been estimated to fit well postwar U.S. business cycles. We find that mild deflation is Ramsey optimal in the long run. However, the optimal inflation rate appears to be highly sensitive to the assumed degree of price stickiness. Within the window of available estimates of price stickiness (between 2 and 5 quarters) the optimal rate of inflation ranges from -4.2 percent per year (close to the Friedman rule) to -0.4 percent per year (close to price stability). This sensitivity disappears when one assumes that lump-sum taxes are unavailable and fiscal instruments take the form of distorting income taxes. In this case, mild deflation emerges as a robust Ramsey prediction. In light of the finding that the Ramsey-optimal inflation rate is negative, it is puzzling that most inflation-targeting countries pursue positive inflation goals. We show that the zero bound on the nominal interest rate, which is often cited as a rationale for setting positive inflation targets, is of no quantitative relevance in the present model. Finally, the paper characterizes operational interest-rate feedback rules that best implement Ramsey-optimal stabilization policy. We find that the optimal interest-rate rule is active in price and wage inflation, mute in output growth, and moderately inertial. This rule achieves virtually the same level of welfare as the Ramsey optimal policy."

 """,2006.,Optimal Inflation Targeting Under Alternative Fiscal Regimes,"407, Central Bank of Chile.","Flexible inflation targeting has been advocated as a practical approach to the implementation of an optimal state-contingent monetary policy, but theoretical expositions reaching this conclusion have typically abstracted from the fiscal consequences of monetary policy. Here we extend the standard theory by considering the character of optimal monetary policy under a variety of assumptions about the fiscal regime, with the standard analysis appearing only as a special case in which non-distorting sources of government revenue exist, and fiscal policy can be relied upon to adjust so as to ensure intertemporal government solvency. Alternative cases treated in this paper include ones in which there exist only distorting sources of government revenue; and also ones in which fiscal policy is purely exogenous, so that the central bank cannot rely upon fiscal policy to adjust in order to maintain intertemporal solvency (a case emphasized in the critique of inflation targeting by Sims, 2005). We find that the fiscal policy regime has important consequences for the optimal conduct of monetary policy, but that a suitably modified form of inflation targeting will still represent a useful approach to the implementation of optimal policy. We derive an optimal targeting rule for monetary policy that applies to all of the fiscal regimes considered in this paper, and show that it involves commitment to an explicit target for an output-gap adjusted price level. The optimal policy will allow temporary departures from the long-run target rate of growth in the gap-adjusted price level in response to disturbances that affect the government’s budget, but it will also involve a commitment to rapidly restore the projected growth rate of this variable to its normal level following such disturbances, so that medium-term inflation expectations should remain firmly anchored despite the occurrence of fiscal shocks."

 """,2006.,Under What Conditions Can Inflation Targeting Be Adopted? The Experience of Emerging Markets,"406, Central Bank of Chile.","While there have been numerous studies of inflation targeting in industrial countries, there has been much less analysis of the effects of inflation targeting in emerging market countries. Based on a new and detailed survey of 31 central banks, this paper shows that inflation targeting in emerging-market countries brings significant benefits to the countries that adopt it relative to other strategies, such as money or exchange rate targeting. Indeed, by comparing the performance of the inflation-targeting countries with a sample of countries that pursue other regimes we show that there are significant improvements in anchoring both inflation and inflation expectations with no adverse effects on output. In addition, under inflation targeting interest rates, exchange rates, and international reserves are less volatile, and the risk of currency crises relative to money or exchange rate targets is smaller. Interestingly, IT seems to outperform exchange rate pegs—even when only successful pegs are chosen in comparison. The survey evidence indicates that it is unnecessary for countries to meet a stringent set of institutional, technical, and economic “preconditions” for the successful adoption of inflation targeting."

 """,2006.,Financial Markets Incompleteness and Inequality Over the Life-Cycle,"405, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper addresses the relevance of contemporary uncertainty under incomplete markets in explaining wealth and consumption inequality when preferences are homogeneous. We explore the role of illiquid saving (saving that cannot be used to buffer contemporary shocks) generated by contemporary uncertainty, and a cost of liquidating saving, in generating differences in saving behaviour between initially-rich and initially-poor in a numerically solved life-cycle model. We observe that the existence of a risk premium significantly increases the ability of the households to accumulate wealth to finance their consumption, even under high risk aversion. We find that there is increasing consumption inequality across the life-cycle between groups, and that this result is boosted by access to risky assets and higher values of the coefficient of risk aversion. Critically, the possibility to borrow against saving helps to prevent increased consumption inequality paths, which is the effect of illiquid saving under contemporary uncertainty. Our findings may help us to understand why the poor save so little, and therefore support social programmes that guarantee a minimum consumption for those below a certain level of wealth to allow them to catch up with wealthier individuals."

 """,2006.,Does Inflation Targeting Make a Difference?,"404, Central Bank of Chile.","Yes, as inferred from panel evidence for inflation-targeting countries and a control group of high-achieving industrial countries that do not target inflation. Our evidence suggests that inflation targeting helps countries achieve lower inflation in the long run, have smaller inflation response to oil-price and exchange-rate shocks, strengthen monetary policy independence, improve monetary policy efficiency, and obtain inflation outcomes closer to target levels. Some benefits of inflation targeting are larger when inflation targeters have achieved disinflation and are able to make their inflation targets stationary. Despite these favorable results for inflation targeting, our evidence generally does not suggest that countries that adopt inflation targeting have attained better monetary policy performance relative to our control group of highly successful non-inflation targeters. However, inflation targeting does seem to help all country groups to move toward performance of the control group. The performance attained by industrial-country inflation targeters generally dominates performance of emerging-economy inflation targeters and is similar to that of industrial non-inflation targeting countries"

 """,2006.,Optimal Inflation Targeting: Further Developments of Inflation Targeting,"403, Central Bank of Chile.","The introduction of inflation targeting has led to major progress in practical monetary policy. Nevertheless, inflation-targeting central banks can make substantial additional progress by being more specific, systematic, and transparent about their operational objectives (in the form of using an explicit intertemporal loss function), their forecasts (in the form of deciding on optimal projections of the instrument rate and the target variables), and their communication (in the form of announcing optimal projections of the instrument rate and target variables). Furthermore, progress can be made by incorporating central-bank judgment and model uncertainty in a systematic way in the forecasting and decision process. In particular, incorporating model uncertainty allows the central bank to do more general “distribution forecast targeting” rather than the more restrictive “mean forecast targeting” under the assumption of approximate certainty equivalence."

Furthermore, imperfect passthrough from exchange rate to import prices is an important feature of the Chilean economy.

Specifically, we use daily data on far-ahead forward inflation compensation—the difference between forward rates on nominal and inflation-indexed bonds—as an indicator of financial market perceptions of inflation risk and the expected level of inflation at long horizons. For the United States, we find that far-ahead forward inflation compensation reacts significantly to macroeconomic data releases, suggesting that long-run inflation expectations are not completely anchored. In contrast, the Canadian inflation compensation data do not exhibit significant sensitivity to either Canadian or U.S. macroeconomic news, consistent with the view that inflation targeting in Canada has been successful in anchoring long-run inflation expectations. Finally, while the requisite data for Chile is only available for a limited sample period (2002-2005), our results are consistent with the hypothesis that inflation targeting in Chile has also succeeded in anchoring long-run inflation expectations."

Combined with changes in central bank structure, this policy framework has yielded low and stable inflation that has brought with it high and stable growth. Taking recent successes as a starting point, we look at the possibility for further improvements. Could countries benefit by shifting from inflation targeting to price-path targeting? Or, should policymakers adopt a hybrid between these two extremes? Whether the optimal rule is pure inflation targeting, pure price-path targeting, or some hybrid depends on the country’s output persistence. Our discussion in this paper focuses not only on hybrid rules, also on the horizon over which such rules should be evaluated. Specifically, we examine the equivalence between a rule with a high weight on inflation targeting that is evaluated only infrequently and one with a high weight on the price-path that is evaluated often. For each country, we are able to derive a horizon for target evaluation that would result in optimal policy. The general result is that when deviations of output from its potential are less persistent, the optimal horizon for target evaluation will be shorter."

In this paper, we reexamine the role of key elements of the inflation targeting framework towards this end, in the context of an economy where economic agents have an imperfect understanding of the macroeconomic landscape within which the public forms expectations and policymakers must formulate and implement monetary policy. Using an estimated model of the U.S. economy, we show that monetary policy rules that would perform well under the assumption of rational expectations can perform very poorly when we introduce imperfect knowledge. We then examine the performance of an easily implemented policy rule that incorporates three key characteristics of inflation targeting: transparency, commitment to maintaining price stability, and close monitoring of inflation expectations, and find that all three play an important role in assuring its success. Our analysis suggests that simple difference rules in the spirit of Knut Wicksell excel at tethering inflation expectations to the central bank’s goal and in so doing achieve superior stabilization of inflation and economic activity in an environment of imperfect knowledge."

The new low-inflation environment has brought noticeable gains—faster global growth, increased stability, and reduced vulnerability. The role of the IMF in helping foster a low-inflation environment is also discussed, highlighting the Fund’s important support for policy reform efforts in its member countries.

However, contrary to the positive relationship predicted by most models, the empirical correlation between bilateral real exchange rates and relative consumptions is typically negative (see Backus and Smith, 1993). In this paper I extend a standard two-country, two-good international business cycle model with internationally incomplete financial markets to incorporate public signals about future innovations to total factor productivity. In this environment, a positive signal increases the relative present value of domestic lifetime income, implying that current consumption can increase by more than current output. This increase in demand in turn generates an appreciation in the real exchange rate, suggesting a potential resolution to the Backus-Smith puzzle. When the economy is calibrated to the United States versus the rest of the industrialized world, numerical simulations deliver a correlation between the exchange rate and relative consumption that is similar to that observed empirically."

The implementation of both cross-section and time-series tests allows coverage of two different situations: economies in transition dynamics and economies in stationary distribution. Because cross-section and time-series tests place different implications on the data one can claim that under the assumption that Chilean regions are in transition towards a stationary distribution, the convergence hypothesis is supported by the data. If one assumes, however, that Chilean regions already achieved their limiting distribution, the convergence hypothesis is not supported by the data."

Empirical analysis reveals that all central banks raise interest rates to curtail inflation, but only some of them make large enough increases to effectively tackle inflation pressures. It also shows that some central banks care simultaneously about exchange rate stability. The potential policy conflict arising from a dual central bank mandate and the unpredictable policy response is probably undermining market confidence in central banks’ commitment to price stability, thereby perpetuating an inflation bias."

In particular, the richest quintile concentrates 57% and 43% of debts and assets, respectively. Overall, households that hold the largest share of the debt are composed by young adults with higher education and formal employment contracts. The analysis also shows that, for the vast majority of households, 80%, their assets are greater than their liabilities, and hence, they are financially less vulnerable to changes in macroeconomic and financial conditions. Only 4% of households register negative net worth and a heavy debt service burden. This highly vulnerable group concentrates 9% of total debt."

This indicates that there is no contagion effect. Instead, when Brazil is in a crisis, its effect over Chile is lower than in normal periods.

How does factor abundance affect the possibilities of achieving comparative advantages in manufactures? Does the type of natural resource abundance make any difference to the path of development? Based on factor-endowment-driven specialization, we study the trade patterns along the paths of development (defined as capital accumulation) for a large sample of countries in the last four decades. Consistently with the idea that countries are located in different cones of diversification, we find that net exports are a non-linear function of the capital/labor ratio of the economy. The pattern of gaining comparative advantages in manufacturing goods as a country develops depends not only on whether it is natural resource abundant or not, but also on its type of natural resources abundance. This paper shows that mineralabundant countries are positioned in a diversification cone with low levels of capital per worker and they are net importers of all manufacturing goods. In contrast to countries with comparative advantages in forestry and agricultural products, mining countries are the least likely group to change their specialization pattern towards manufacturing goods. On the other hand when we use human capital instead of physical, we find that mineral abundant countries will move to a cone where they produce and export capital intensive manufactures. The forest abundant countries will attain comparative advantages in machinery as they accumulate human capital. Looking at the mineral abundant countries we find some differences in the path of development for oil exporters and non-oil exporters."

The model estimates suggest that the short end of the yield curve is mainly driven by changes in first latent factor, while long-term interest rates are mainly explained by the second latent factor. Consequently, when examining movements in the term structure, one should think of at least two forces that hit the economy: temporary shocks that change short-term and medium-term interest rates by much larger amounts than long-term interest rates, causing changes in the slope of the yield curve; and long-lived innovations which have persistent effects on the level of the yield curve."

This generalizes most previous tests which compare forecast errors of one model, the null, to errors of the plain alternative model, not allowing for shrinkage. We argue that tests derived from this shrinkage approach display in general better small sample properties than MSPE based tests of the MDH.

The negative association between trade outcomes and price distortions is fundamentally driven by the positive link between openness and price distortions. Second, increases in trade around the time of liberalization are positively related to a decline in aggregate price distortions for the sample of trade-liberalizing countries. Third, the extent of production reallocation is positively associated with the degree of relative price changes that occur around the time of liberalization, particularly across constant-return-to-scale sectors. Fourth, changes in relative prices at the industry level within countries are positively correlated with changes in output, productivity, and firm size, and negatively associated with the number of firms.

In that model, trade protection may ameliorate the problem of underemployment (and underproduction) in sectors affected by labor market distortions; hence trade liberalization unambiguously increases per capita income only when labor markets are sufficiently flexible. We then present some panel evidence on how the growth effect of openness depends on a variety of structural characteristics. For this purpose, we use a non-linear growth regression specification that interacts a proxy of trade openness with proxies of educational investment, financial depth, inflation stabilization, public infrastructure, governance, labor-market flexibility, ease of firm entry, and ease of firm exit.

 """,2006.,Market Reforms and Efficiency Gains in Chile,"372, Central Bank of Chile.","Starting in the mid 1970s, Chile implemented a deep and comprehensive set of structural market reforms. In spite of the wide agreement there is with respect to the benefits these reforms should have on growth, little evidence has been provided to empirically establish and to quantify this connection. Using plant-level data on Chilean manufacturing firms for the 1980-2001 period, we provide suggestive evidence of the role of structural reforms on plant efficiency. The paper first analyzes the behavior of aggregate total factor productivity constructed from data at the plant-level. We find that, once major reforms had been fully implemented, aggregate efficiency gains were explained in equal proportions by within plant improvements and by the net entry of new and more productive economic units. The reallocation among incumbent plants did not contribute significantly to the enhancement of efficiency. The paper also finds that within-plant efficiency gains were the largest among firms producing traded goods, and among firms that were more likely to face binding liquidity constraints. Thus, in Chile, the adoption of better technologies and production processes, fostered by broader foreign exposure and a superior access to external finance, seem to have at least partially accounted for the observed improvement in manufacturing performance."

By contrast, the composition of debt in the region has changed significantly, shifting from foreign currency external to local currency domestic debt. This “onshoring” and “ dedollarization” of sovereign debt, contrary to conventional wisdom, has not come at the expense of a shortening of maturities. Furthermore, we find that “onshoring” is correlated with the level economic development and country size, and with the presence of institutional investors."

The existence of managed exchange rate regimes, a narrow base of domestic nominal financial assets, the lack of market instruments to hedge exchange rate risk, together with fear of floating and dollarization, have been stressed as factors that might weaken the efficacy of monetary policy. By examining various aspects of monetary transmission and policy formulation in two highly dollarized economies (Peru and Bolivia) vis-à-vis two economies with low levels of dollarization (Chile and Colombia), we found that, while dollarization imposes differences in both the transmission capacity of monetary policy and its impact on real and financial sectors, it does not preclude the use of inflation targeting as a policy regime."

Defining a range and the percentage of time expected to be within such range is the same as defining a target for inflation projection in a given horizon. Both forms are similar to defining a target in terms of the expected value and desired variance for inflation. Likewise, it shows that the tolerance to deviations from the inflation target, directly associated to the policy horizon, depends on the costs of inflation deviations from the target, and also on output deviations from full employment.

After some fluctuations in the 1960s and 1970s, the skill premium increased in the 1980s and has remained roughly constant since then. A simple accounting framework suggests that this evolution is an outcome of a significant increase in relative demand for skilled workers in the 1980s and 1990s and a sizeable increase in the relative supply in the 1990s. Next, I explain the evolution of the relative demand for skilled labor in Chile in the context of the Acemoglu (2003a) model of endogenous technological choice where new technologies are produced in developed countries (like the US) and adopted in developing economies (like Chile). Macro evidence and sectoral evidence confirm the main theoretical prediction of the model: patterns of skill upgrading in Chile have followed the evolution of the same variable in the US."

Today central banks’ legal and actual independence is substantially higher than it was twenty years ago, and price stability has become their primary objective. The paper reviews the institutional changes that occurred over the last two decades in the area of central bank autonomy and related monetary policymaking institutions around the world, providing an overview of accumulated empirical evidence on the relation between central bank independence and macroeconomic performance. Lessons from inflation stabilization are considered in conjunction with central bank independence within the broader context of choice of nominal anchor. The last part considers future challenges facing independent central banks in an era of price stability. Onceinflation has been conquered, the bank is naturally expected to devote more attention to the stabilization of the output gap. Risks associated with such a flexible inflation-targeting regime are examined, along with issues of accountability and transparency, which become more important in the new regime. The paper also reviews the tradeoffs between democratic accountability and central bank autonomy that arise in the context of distribution of central bank profits (or losses) between the central bank and the government and the choice of central bank capital."

In this paper we show that an international RBC model similar to the one proposed by CKM but extended by considering nontraded goods and an incomplete asset market structure can solve this anomaly. Non tradable goods amplify wealth effects that arise from the incomplete assets market structure generating a negative comovement between the real exchange rate and relative consumption. The model performs reasonable well with other business cycle moments and, by adding distribution services in terms of nontraded goods, it generates a real exchange rate as volatile as in the data.

Second, Global Inflation is, consistently with standard models of inflation, a function of real developments at short horizons and monetary developments at longer horizons.

It is argued that a worldwide oil price increase affects domestic prices through a direct and an indirect channel. The former derives from the direct import of petroleum related products, which become more expensive, while the latter channel derives from the import of commodities whose production costs involve expenditures on any petroleum derivative product. In addition, three different central bank monetary policy responses to the oil shock namely a passive position, an output targeting policy, and inflation targeting are simulated and their results are compared. It is concluded that an inflation targeting regime, which is expected to be fully functioning in Guatemala by 2006 would be a better monetary policy response to contrarrest the negative effects of an oil shock, rather than the output targeting policy that is currently being undertaken."

We also simulate the counterfactual responses in a flexible prices and wages equilibrium, and under alternative monetary frameworks.

In this setup, we investigate the way in which monetary policy has been designed. We also assess the performance of simple optimal rules under alternative preferences that the central bank may have, and we investigate whether the Phillips curve can be represented by a hybrid specification which considers inflation persistence. We conclude that the conduct of monetary policy in Chile during the last fifteen years can be characterized by a feedback rule in which the interest rate reacts to contemporaneous inflation misalignment from the target and to output deviations from its natural level. This policy presents an important degree of persistence, that has, however, declined in the past five years. Furthermore, fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate are not offset by the monetary authority: the interest rate response to movements in this variable is not different from zero. A second set of results indicates that inflation persistence, which is usually absent from the standard neo-Keynesian models, is a feature of the Chilean economy. In particular, a model in which the Phillips equation contains a lagged inflation term is preferred to an alternative one which does not consider inflation persistence. This inflation persistence has change in recent years, becoming less important than in the early nineties. On the other hand, since 1999 prices are adjusted less frequently: the probability of resetting prices has fallen. Finally, optimal simple rules for alternative preferences of the central bank show that, besides reacting to inflation and output, there are no welfare gains from reacting to exchange rate movements."

 """,2005.,Fundamental Economic Shocks and The Macroeconomy,"351, Central Bank of Chile.","Recently there has been renewed interest in assessing economic models in the context of specific, empirically identified economic shocks. Typically, these shocks are identified one-at-a-time, ignoring potential correlations across shocks, or are identified in the context of a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) using zero restrictions only loosely tied to economic theory. In this paper, we develop an alternative approach that utilizes measures of economic shocks explicitly derived from economic models to identify multiple orthogonal structural impulses. We use this approach to identify technology shocks, marginal-rate-of-substitution (labor supply) shocks, and monetary policy shocks in the context of a Factor Augmented VAR. We then examine the Bayesian posterior distribution for the responses of a large number of endogenous macroeconomic and financial variables to these three shocks.. The shocks account for the preponderance of output, productivity and price fluctuations. Technology shocks have a permanent impact on measures of economic activity, whereas the other shocks are more transitory. Labor inputs have little initial response to technology shocks, with the response building steadily over the 5 year period. Consumption’s sluggish response to the technology shock is inconsistent with a simple formulation of the permanent income hypothesis, but would be consistent with a model of habit formation. Monetary policy has a rather small response to technology shocks, but responds “leans against the wind” in response to the more cyclical labor supply shock. This more cyclical shock has the biggest impact on interest rates. Stock prices respond to all three shocks. A number of other empirical implications of our approach are discussed."

 """,2005.,Inflation Premium and Oil Price Volatility,"350, Central Bank of Chile.","In this paper we establish a link between the volatility of oil price shocks and a positive expected value of inflation in equilibrium (inflation premium). In doing so, we implement the perturbation method to solve up to second order a benchmark New Keynesian model with oil price shocks. In contrast with log linear approximations, the second order solution relaxes certainty equivalence providing a link between the volatility of shocks and inflation premium. First, we obtain analytical results for the determinants of the level of inflation premium. Thus, we find that the degree of convexity of both the marginal cost and the Phillips curve is a key element in accounting for the existence of a positive inflation premium. We further show that the level of inflation premium might be potentially large even when a central bank implements an active monetary policy. Second, we evaluate numerically the second order solution of the model to explain the episode of high and persistent inflation observed in the US during the 70’s. We find, in contrast with Clarida, Gali and Gertler (QJE, 2000), that even when there is no difference in the monetary policy rules between the pre-Volcker and post-Volcker periods, oil price shocks can generate high inflation levels during the 70’s through a positive high level of inflation premium. As by product, our analysis shows that oil price shocks along with a distorted steady state can generate a time-varying endogenous trade-off between inflation and deviations of output from its efficient level. The previous trade-off, once uncertainty is taking into account, implies that a positive level of inflation premium is an optimal response to oil price shocks."

It is an extension of Bugarin et al. (2005) concentrating on the consequence of energy price increases, facing different monetary policy rules. Following Hall (1988 e 1990) and Finn (2000) it is considered that an increase in energy prices acts like a negative productivity shock. The model provides an accessible description of an artificial economy with a tractable micro-founded dynamic setting with forward looking rational agents in a small open economy with a staggered pricing mechanism that generates inflation inertia and recessionary disinflations. Alternative specification of monetary reaction functions are introduced into the model economy in order to perform a sensitivity analysis of derived impulse responses to those interventions facing the negative productivity shock. The preliminary results suggest that the introduction of habit persistence into the consumption hypothesis does not make much difference. However the introduction of different monetary reaction functions does alter the impulse response of output, inflation rate, and nominal interest rate. A common result is the decline in potential output for all models. Additionally, the only case where a reduction in the output gap is observed is when using the Taylor rule that takes into consideration the output gap and past interest rates with high persistence."

However, once we adequately control for differences in the currency composition of assets, income and net derivative positions, we do find a significant balance sheet effect. In addition, we find that derivatives play a role in insulating firm level investment from exchange rate shocks. In line with previous studies, we also find evidence of currency matching in Chilean corporates. Firms in Chile actively reduce the risks associated with exchange rate exposure by matching the currency composition of their debt with that of their income and assets, and by taking on derivatives if no “real” hedge is available. Finally, we find significant changes in the level of net currency exposure after the exchange rate was floated in 1999. We argue that one possible interpretation of these results is due to the effect of higher exchange rate variance on the relative risk of domestic and foreign debt."

But a weak institutional framework meant that the Bank, far from ameliorating these problems, aggravated them, leading to decades of high and persistent inflation. Inflation became under control only during the past decade, after a new law enacted in 1989 granted the Central Bank full independence, allowing it to implement an inflation-targeting monetary policy regime.

We find that real house prices are pro-cyclical—comoving with real GDP, consumption, investment, CPI inflation, budget and current account balances, and output gaps. House price booms are typically preceded by a period of easing monetary policy, but then diminishing slack and rising inflation lead monetary authorities to begin tightening policy before house prices peak. In a careful reading of official reports, speeches, and minutes, we find little evidence that foreign central banks have reacted to past episodes of rising real house prices beyond taking into account their implications for inflation and output growth. However, central bankers have expressed a range of opinions in the more recent policy debate with some willing in certain cases to raise policy rates to try to stem current and future surges in asset prices while others favor moral suasion or a hands-off approach. Finally, we characterize the risks associated with house-price reversals. Although mortgage lenders in some countries have significant exposure to house prices, the balance of evidence suggests that this exposure does not, in and of itself, pose a significant risk to financial stability. Nevertheless, the co-movement of both property prices and default rates with the business cycle means that losses on mortgage lending are likely to be higher when banks’ other lines of business are also performing poorly."

On fiscal rules, this paper presents the structural balance methodology used by the Chilean public sector since 2001. This rule implies that expenditures should evolve according to the dynamics of structural fiscal income, which is consistent with full employment and a long-term copper price. The key assumptions underlying the trend GDP growth and the long-term copper price are not set in a discretional way but rather follow the recommendations of two panels of independent experts. We conclude with a positive assessment of the recent Chilean experience with monetary and fiscal policy rules. This positive assessment is driven by the prominent role of monetary policy as the stabilizing macroeconomic instrument under a credible inflation targeting regime, and the avoidance of pro cyclical fiscal policies. In spite of tumultuous external conditions between 1999 and 2003, the Chilean economy managed to sustain positive rates of growth, record-low domestic interest rates and sovereign spreads, stable external public debt, as well as low inflation. The recent upswing in 2004 and 2005 has been accompanied by a smooth normalization of monetary conditions and a substantial improvement in fiscal balances."

A succession of events affected these economies such as the Asian crisis, the Russian default, the Brazilian devaluation, the Ecuadorian default, the Turkish crisis and the Argentine default. Our empirical estimations allow us to construct taxonomy of these crises. First, the Russian default and the Turkish crisis correspond to episodes of global reduction of portfolio flows to emerging sovereign debt markets. Second, the Brazilian devaluation was fundamentally an abatement of portfolio flows to Latin America and East Europe (except for Russia). Third, the Asian crisis and the Ecuadorian default were consistent with a rebalancing of portfolios in emerging markets. Fourth, although the Argentine crisis shares some similarities with the former crises, it is unique in the sense that it was fully anticipated long before it happened. Finally, in light of these results, policy-makers in emerging markets should be keenly aware of the possibility that their country might be hit by a crisis so structural reforms should also include policies that help to protect the country from these unruly episodes."

On the other hand, the degree of financial openness does not appear to be related to the intensity with which reversals affect real economic performance."

We also find that the response of Chilean interest rates is quite smaller than the one found in the international literature. Finally, we find that inflation compensation (the difference between nominal and real rates) is largely invariant to policy shocks, which suggests that the inflation targeting framework in Chile has been successful in anchoring inflation expectations to the target."

In the emerging market world, financial crises are seen more often than not. An obvious question is whether these events, each associated with a particular country, spread to other countries, regardless of economic fundamentals at that specific point in time. That is, if the ‘simultaneous’ movements that we observe in spreads across emerging market economies are linked to economic fundamentals. We find that the correlation across countries is regionally dominated. Spreads from sovereigns with high savings rates, low indebtedness and good credit ratings are less likely to co-move with spreads where financial crises are being originated."

Thus, this study aim at analyzing the main hypotheses raised on investment differentiation by credit rating and inter-regional contagion based upon the performance of the sovereign spread volatility of emerging markets economies. The main results support the hypothesis that a clear differentiation from global investors about emerging markets cannot be observed during tranquil periods. However, a higher preference can be observed for better credit rating assets under periods of turbulence in the international financial markets."

Among key results, we find that foreign shocks have been the dominant source of business cycle fluctuations, followed by monetary policy shocks, while fiscal policy shocks explain relatively little; and that despite of the increased synchronization of the domestic business cycle with international conditions, the resilience of the Chilean economy to external shocks has increased during the nineties, with countercyclical policies playing an important role in such a positive development"

 """,2005.,"Sovereign Debt, Volatility and Insurance","330, Central Bank of Chile.","External debt increases the vulnerability of indebted emerging market economies to macroeconomic volatility and financial crises. Capital account reversals often lead to sovereign debt repayment crises that are only resolved after prolonged and difficult debt restructuring. Foreign indebtedness exacerbates domestic financial distress in crisis, increasing both the incidence and severity of emerging market crises. These outcomes contrast with the presumption that access to international capital markets should help countries to smooth domestic consumption and investment against macroeconomic shocks. This paper uses models of sovereign to reconsider the role of sovereign debt renegotiation for international risk sharing and presents an approach for analyzing contractual innovations for implementing contingent debt repayments. The financial innovations that might allow risk-sharing rather than risk-inducing capital flows go beyond contractual changes that ease debt renegotiation by separating contingent payments from bonds."

Hoarding international reserves can be used to smooth the impact of such reversals, but these reserves are seldom sufficient and always expensive to hold. In this paper we argue that adding richer hedging instruments to the portfolios held by central banks can significantly improve the efficiency of the anti-sudden stop mechanism. We illustrate this point with a simple quantitative hedging model, where optimally used options and futures on the S&P100’s implied volatility index (VIX), increases the expected reserves available during sudden stops by as much as 40 percent."

First, we show that very little of this difference can be explained by more volatile fundamentals or by higher sensitivity to fundamentals. Second, we show that most of the difference in volatility can be accounted for by three characteristics of capital flows: (i) capital flows to emerging countries are more subject to occasional large negative shocks (“crises”) than those to developed countries, (ii) shocks are subject to contagion, and (iii) – the most important one – shocks to capital flows to emerging countries are more persistent than those to developed countries. Finally, we study a number of country characteristics to determine which are most associated with capital flow volatility. Our results suggest that underdevelopment of domestic financial markets, weak institutions, and low income per capita, are all associated with capital flow volatility."

Assuming a constant rate of return and fixed financing costs, the agent can face the event of insolvency due to swings in the relevant exchange rate that is assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion. Then, the process is generalized to allow dependency of the diffusion coefficient on the level of the exchange rate, reproducing many of the properties encountered in empirical studies of financial asset prices. The resulting hyperbolic process is calibrated via a martingale estimating function, and then we approximate the probability that the value of assets fails to match the value of liabilities at a given future date. The findings are consistent regardless the volatility assumption of the process. Finally, we give some insights to minimize the probability of such event."

 """,2005.,Exchange Rate Interventions and Insurance: Is “Fear of Floating” a Cause For Concern?,"326, Central Bank of Chile.","Fear of floating” is one of the central empirical characteristics of exchange rate regimes in emerging markets. However, while some view “fear of floating” in terms of the optimal ex post monetary response to external shocks, protecting balance sheets and avoiding inflation, others have argued that from an ex ante perspective such a policy leads to private sector underinsurance against sudden stops. A commitment to floating during potential crises would increase the incentives of the private sector to conserve international liquidity. This paper develops a model of the optimal exchange rate regime when both ex ante and ex post concerns are present. Since it is only “fear of floating” during potential sudden stops which undermines insurance, we reexamine the data on exchange rate regimes for evidence that exchange rate flexibility is state-contingent. We find most emerging markets exhibit non-contingent policies with a uniformly low level of flexibility, which together with an absence of substituteinsurance policies supports the claim that greater exchange rate flexibility during sudden stops would be desirable for such countries. However, more recent floats with intermediate levels of credibility exhibit little state contingency because of a uniformly high degree of flexibility. More established floats with high credibility exhibit statecontingent regimes, retaining a capacity for discretionary intervention, but floating during potential crises. Exchange rate flexibility is associated with increased private sector hoarding of dollar assets and reduced incidence of sudden stops. Together the evidence suggests that the insurance benefits to floating for emerging markets can be substantial and that the credibility of the monetary policy framework is central to successful implementation of this policy."

We discuss the role played by capital controls, financial regulations and the exchange rate regime. The focus is on the period after 1990, the period when Chile returned to international capital markets. We also discuss the early 80s, where a currency collapse triggered a financial crisis in Chile, despite stricter capital controls on inflows than the 90s and tighter currency matching requirements on the banking sector. We conclude that financial regulation and the exchange rate regime are at the center of capital inflows experiences and financial vulnerabilities. Rigid exchange rates induce vulnerabilities, which may lead to sharp capital account reversals. We also discuss three important characteristics of the Chilean experience since the 90s. The first is the fact that most international borrowing is done directly by corporations and it is not intermediated by the banking system. The second is the implication of the free trade agreement of Chilean and the US regarding capital controls. Finally, we examine the Chilean experience following the Asian-Russia crisis, showing that Chile did not suffer a sudden-stop, but a current account reversal due to policy reactions and a sudden-start in capital outflows."

Unlike almost all previous studies on money in Chile, we compare 10 traditional and new definitions of money, rather than just looking at the customary definition M1A. Also, given the changes in the financial system and disinflation in Chile over the last 20 years, as well as contrasting growth rates of GDP and narrow money in recent times, we report recursive estimations for all our statistics to highlight parameter constancy. While there seems to be a strong and often one-to-one association between money growth and inflation on average over the whole sample as indicated by Nelson (2003) type regressions, the relation drops strongly during the last 10 years, and thus seems much lower in times of low inflation. Also, an increase in nominal money growth never causes acceleration of inflation in a Granger sense. However, we do find a significant and positive impact of deviations from (an estimated or HP-filtered) equilibrium level of money holdings on inflation, as indicated by error-correction and Pstar models. But the deviations from a simple estimated equilibrium are very large for both broad money aggregates and M1A at the end of the sample, casting some doubt on the stability of their demand relation. Accordingly, cointegration tests for the existence of a stable demand for money function over the whole sample are somewhat inconclusive. We find a strong Granger causality relationship between money and output, which however vanishes once we control for the effect of past inflation and changes in the monetary policy rate. Also, the information in lags of M1A for GDP drops strongly towards the end of the sample. More generally, M1A does not seem to merit its role as the money sum par excellence in Chile, being inferior in information content for example to Notes and Coin, or a broad money sum excluding bonds (M7 minus Central Bank documents)."

I find that balance sheet effects, captured by the interaction between the real exchange rate devaluation and the level of external indebtedness of the country, have a significant and negative impact on output. Nevertheless, there is also evidence of a positive effect of the real devaluation associated to the traditional expansionary effect. For countries with large foreign-denominated external debt, the combined effect of the real exchange rate depreciation is likely to generate significant output losses in the short-run. However, in the medium term, the expansionary effect of the real devaluation tends to dominate the balance sheet effect, which implies a positive effect on output in the medium term. Finally, countries with deeper financial market experience lower output losses following a devaluation."

Siguiendo la literatura más reciente, que destaca el rol que juegan las instituciones y políticas en el crecimiento económico, argumentamos que el mejor desempeño de Chile se debió a que las reformas implementadas fueron mucho más profundas y abarcaron más áreas que aquellas implementadas en otros países de América Latina. Durante este proceso Chile terminó con fundamentos económicos más sólidos y, aún más importante, con mejores instituciones, lo que le permitió enfrentar de mejor manera los shocks adversos en los noventa. Basados en un modelo econométrico de corte transversal estimado para el período 1960-2000, argumentamos que el mejor desempeño de Chile vis-a-vis al resto de la región puede ser explicado en partes iguales por las mejores instituciones y políticas del país (en contraste, el mejor desempeño de Asia del Este es explicado principalmente por mejores políticas). Adicionalmente, estimamos que América Latina puede aumentar su tasa de crecimiento anual del producto per cápita un 1,6%, en promedio, si tuviera la calidad de instituciones de Chile. Por otro lado, si el promedio de los países de América Latina tuviera políticas (desarrollo financiero y sobrevaluación cambiaria) similares a Chile, la tasa de crecimiento anual del producto per cápita aumentaría en un 1,0%, en promedio.

For the estimations, a two-level model is used with graduates from the same career, level 1, and grouped by universities, level 2. Some conclusions can be drawn from the results. First, rank depends on the career choice. However, universities in the Santiago and Valparaíso regions seem to predominate, particularly the traditional (existing before the Reform of 1981 that boosted the creation of private colleges) and earlier established ones. Second, rankings are generally robust when considering different groups of graduates. However, some evidence exists in favor of a tradeoff between number and quality of professionals, and of the presence of a “signal” effect à la Spence."

In particular, it presents a methodology that uses the sovereign bond spread as the financial time series to determine the impact of the volatility of the first-infected country on the behaviour of other emerging economies. Our main results reveal that only the Asia 1997 crisis had negative effects —both within and outside the region— on other emerging economies, in the form of increased sovereign spread volatility. On the other hand, the crises of Mexico 1994 and Argentina 2002 seem to have caused a minor additional effect on the stability of international markets for emerging bonds."

These elements contribute to diminish the costs of the floating exchange rate regime, reducing its implied financial and price instability threat, and therefore avoiding fear of floating. Moreover, it provides enough credibility to the current exchange rate system, reinforcing the commitment to making interventions a rare event."

We derive an optimizing macroeconomic model that features habit formation in the consumer's utility function and uses a hybrid New Keynesian Phillips curve with inflation inertia. As a consequence, aggregate demand and supply shocks will have a persistent effect on output and inflation. In this framework, we assess the performance of simple, and perhaps non-optimal, interest rate rules under different degrees of habit formation and inflation persistence. We conclude that a policy rule that responds to expected inflation, as well as to output and the exchange rate, is able to reduce output and inflation volatility in the face of aggregate demand and foreign inflation shocks. This result must be interpreted with caution, because, as is found in other studies, i) the reduction in volatility is marginal and ii) the Taylor-type policy rule assessed here may be a restrictive one and, as mentioned before, non-optimal. On the other hand, the gains from adopting an inertial interest rate rule are directly related to the degree of inflation persistence in the model. In particular, when the degree of inflation persistence is high, an inertial policy rule attenuates the impacts that supply shocks have on inflation and the interest rate."

In this article, we include technology shocks that affect the average productivity and idiosyncratic risk of capital producers in a standard costly external finance model. These elements enhance the model to deliver a countercyclical default rate, external finance and relative price of capital premium which is more consistent with the data and contrary to the result obtained with a sector neutral productivity shock. Intuitively, if the entrepreneurs' investment projects become more productive in average, the relative price of capital and the default rate fall while the investment and output increase. Using data on the relative price of capital, we perform a calibration of this type of shocks which highlights its business cycle relevance."

This work analyzes the role of the real exchange rate and world economic activity during the 1990-2001 period, after performing an extensive refinement and cleaning of export bundles by region. Based on a multivariate cointegration analysis, we find different effects of the real exchange rate and world output on the exported quantum. The long-run elasticity of the real exchange rate goes from 0.2 to 0.8 percent for Europe, Asia and United States, and it is non significant for Aladi countries, for which a lower effect of this latter variable is found as a determinant of regional exports. On the other hand, elasticity with respect to world output ranges between 2.3 and 4 percent for the United States, and between 1.2 and 2 percent for the other regions. A panel analysis supports the view that world output plays a significant role,while the real exchange rate is less important.

Given its present level of economic development, major weaknesses are observed in the National System of Innovation. Among them, scarce resources devoted to R&D expressed as a proportion of GDP, low participation of professionals and scientific workforce in research activities and negligible private involvement in financing these activities. We discuss the fundamental role of the public sector in the active promotion of these activities, especially at universities and private firms. In particular, we explore different economic policies aimed at enhancing the participation of the private sector in R&D activities. Revising the Chilean situation, we suggest that although many current programs aimed at supporting research activities are solving most of the typical market failures associated with R&D and innovation, we diagnose that there is a lack of coordination between allexisting initiatives. There is a systemic failure. Based on international experience, we suggest that by designing an explicit technology policy at the national level this failure could be solved. A technology board that gives directions, priorities, rules and performs periodic evaluations, may increase the economic efficiency of public resources devoted to these fundamental activities."

We use two variants of the model, the original Hallman et al (1991), and Gerlach and Svensson (2003), that conditions on an inflation target. We estimate both models for 6 different monetary aggregates, and 2 alternative estimates of equilibrium velocity. We find that over the estimation period, deviations of velocity from its equilibrium have significant effects on inflation, across models and definitions of the money gap, and for both narrow and broad money. The usual Chilean aggregate M1A, although it has some indicator properties, is outperformed by other money aggregates, first of all cash in the hands of the public, and a broad money aggregate containing time and foreign currency deposits. However, out-of sample forecasts show that over the recent past, most money gaps do not improve inflation forecasts. Also, inflation forecasts from broad and narrow money aggregates diverge in opposite directions in recent years, reflecting the estimated gaps that are large both for M1A and broader definitions of money, but opposite in sign. This finding puts a question mark behind the stability of money demand in recent times of stable and low inflation."

We analyze the possibility of nonlinearities by allowing the growth effects of openness to vary with the general level of economic development and by letting the effects of foreign shocks to depend on the degree of trade and financial integration. The findings point toward non-monotonic effects of openness, in the sense that the growth effects of trade and financial openness increase with the level of development, tapering off for high levels of income. In addition, the paper finds that trade openness tends to dampen the growth effect of trade-related shocks while amplifying the shocks related to financial markets. Interestingly, financial openness tends to have the opposite effect."

For that, investment in both human and physical capital must be increased. The paper also studies growth patterns by sectors and finds a high degree of heterogeneity. More aggregate results, separating between tradables and nontradables over the years of fast economic growth (1986-1998), show that the contribution of TFP is as important as the accumulation of capital and labor in explaining the years of fast growth of the nontradable sector (1987-1991), while in 1992-1998, this sector’s expansion was due only to factor accumulation. On the contrary, the tradable sector increased thanks to the accumulation of capital and labor, with almost no increase in productivity in 1987-1991, while TFP was significant in explaining growth between 1992 and 1998."

During 1961-1973 the contribution of capital dominates,labor takes over in 1974-1989, and TFP in 1990-2003. Evidence on TFP determinants suggests that,besides cyclical factors, TFP growth reflects the impact of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. The interaction of both factors in TFP behavior is worth noting. Evidence suggests also that, under conditions of high macroeconomic instability, the effects of a structural reform on TFP are smaller, and vice versa.

Second, stabilizing non-tradable inflation is optimal regardless of the financial structure of the small open economy. Even for a moderate degree of price stickiness, implementing a monetary policy that mitigates asset market segmentation is highly distortionary.

Until recently, trade economists had thought that their systematic research during the 1970s and 1980s had conclusively established the positive relationship between trade and growth. But the criticisms of the evidence by free-trade critics such as Joseph Stiglitz and Dani Rodrik and continued attack on the wisdom of trade liberalization by others including influential NGOs have made it essential to restate and defend this link explicitly. Once this is done, we can turn to an assessment of whether PTAs, which form a specific form of trade liberalization, promote trade in ways that is conducive to growth.

The literature on the economics of RIAs deals mostly with static effects, and concludes that these effects are in general ambiguous. So far, there has been no empirical analysis of the dynamic effects of RIAs based on their impact on technology diffusion from partner and non-partner countries. This paper is a first attempt in this direction. It examines the impact of NAFTA on total factor productivity (TFP) in Mexico through its impact on trade-related technology transfers from OECD countries. Trade-related technology diffusion is estimated with the use of a measure of trade-related foreign R&D. Foreign R&D is constructed based on industry-specific R&D in the OECD, OECD-Mexico trade patterns, and input-output relations in Mexico. We separate the OECD into two parts, Mexico’s NAFTA partners (US + Canada) and the rest of the OECD. We find, first, that Mexico’s trade with its NAFTA partners has a large and significant impact on Mexico’s TFP while trade with the rest of the OECD does not. This is likely to be due to the fact that Mexico not only benefits from the R&D content of the trade with its Northern neighbors but also benefits from direct contact and close exchanges of information, especially for sub-contracting firms which are more closely integrated in the US and Canada production networks than with the production networks of the more distant countries of the rest of the OECD. Second, we simulate the impact of NAFTA and find that it has led to a permanent increase in TFP in Mexico’s manufacturing sector of between 5.5%and 7.5% and to some convergence to the economies of the US and Canada."

These two effects, in return, impact the endogenous formation of RTAs. The investment expansion effect results from foreign firms’ ability to serve a larger market from a single facility. The relocation effect occurs due to the firms’ desire to move their initial plants from high-cost member countries to low-cost ones. The relocation effect can overwhelm the expansion effect for the high-cost members and lead to the collapse of socially efficient RTAs. The auto industry in Mercosur is a great example to study these phenomena. Argentina was worried that low-cost Brazil would attract all of the foreign investment and dominate both markets. To convince Argentina to agree to free trade in automobiles (and to Mercosur), the auto sectoral agreement included the Compensated Trade Clause (CTC) which requires each firm to balance its trade between these countries. This mitigates the relocation problem by forcing firms to produce some models in Argentina and entices the governments to sign the RTA.."

This paper examines the relative impacts of these programs on the value of imports from different trading partners. We address four technical but policy-relevant issues: (1) We consider not only country eligibility in assessing impact of various programs, but also the extent of utilization of these programs, which depends on the relevant rules of origin and other compliance costs. (2) Trade preferences are granted for non-economic motivations that are correlated with variables included in gravity models. We provide new estimates that control for this potential source of selection bias. (3) We provide new estimates of the impact of transport and transactions costs beyond distance. (4) Finally, we control the censoring of trade flows at zero which tends to bias estimates of key coefficients in gravity models. In the standard gravity estimation, we find that beneficiaries of these preferences, except the GSP, export between 2-3 times more than the excluded countries. However, these levels go down considerably when utilization ratios and selection biases are taken into account. These results are robust to the various estimation techniques as well as endogenous treatment and Heckman-selection estimates that control for the selection biases mentioned above."

 """,2004.,Reciprocity in Free Trade Agreements,"279, Central Bank of Chile.","We use detailed trade, tariff, and income data for countries involved in 91 trade agreements negotiated since 1980 to test for reciprocity in free trade agreements. The results offer strong evidence of reciprocity in North-North and South-South free trade agreements, but there is little empirical support for reciprocity in North-South trade agreements. In particular, after controlling for other determinants of trade preferences, the results suggest that a one percent increase in preferences offered leads to about a one half of a percent increase in preferences received in North-North and South-South trade agreements. We also find evidence that large countries extract greater trade concessions from small countries. This leads to a modified form of reciprocity in North-South agreements; a large increase in access to a developing-country market leads to only a small increase in access to a rich-country market. The results imply that there are incentives for countries to maintain protection in order to extract more concessions from trade partners. In general, however, such perverse incentives should be less of a concern in developing countries involved in North- South agreements because the value of a developing-country tariff preference in terms of its effect on trade preferences from a rich country is quite small. The gains from unilateral liberalization are likely to far outweigh potential gains from using protection as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations. The evidence is consistent with a repeated game model of trade liberalization. The model presented shows that trade preferences granted are increasing in trade preferences received. This implies that countries can extract greater concessions from trade agreement members if they have higher external trade barriers. However, if a country’s trade barriers are very large, the gains from reneging on the agreement in the short run will be high and can make the agreement unenforceable despite offering long-term gains. Thus, there is a reciprocity-credibility tradeoff. High tariffs may allow countries to extract more concessions from potential trade agreement partners, but they also make the country less credible in implementing agreed tariff concessions. In addition, we find that agreements between countries with similar cost structures are more likely to require reciprocity to be sustained, suggesting that reciprocity is more likely to be observed in North-North and South-South trade agreements."

General equilibrium under moral hazard shows a unique and stable steady state, but involves at least temporary rationing of profitable projects and possibly capital flight from developing countries."

In particular, using as a case study the Chilean inflation-targeting experience of the nineties, we assess the roles of the exchange rate and output in the determination of the policy interest rate. We conclude that Chile adopted a gradual approach to targeting inflation. This means, in practice, that the central bank modified its policy instrument —the interest rate— whenever expected inflation deviated from its target, but with some concern about output. In this context, we find evidence that the monetary authorities also reacted to real exchange rate misalignments. This reaction was comparatively larger than the one found in developed economies. Finally, the evidence, although not conclusive, suggests that there was a non-linear response to exchange rate misalignments: the central bank reacted more strongly to large deviations than to small ones."

The model’s basic relations are derived from intertemporal optimization by a group of rational forward-looking agents. The model also adds critical real-world features – such as short-run wage rigidities and a group of myopic agents – that generate deviations from the frictionless fullemployment equilibrium of the unconstrained neoclassical paradigm. The model is numerically simulated to illustrate the dynamics of Chile’s economy in response to the external shocks and policy shifts that led to the 1998-99 recession.

The empirical strategy involves the estimation of simple equations for GDP growth and conventional inequality measures, augmented to include among the regressors infrastructure quantity and quality indicators in addition to standard controls. To account for the potential endogeneity of infrastructure (as well as that of other regressors), we use a variety of GMM estimators based on both internal and external instruments, and report results using both disaggregated and synthetic measures of infrastructure quantity and quality. The two robust results are: (i) growth is positively affected by the stock of infrastructure assets, and (ii) income inequality declines with higher infrastructure quantity and quality. A variety of specification tests suggest that these results do capture the causal impact of the exogenous component of infrastructure quantity and quality on growth and inequality. These two results combined suggest that infrastructure development can be highly effective to combat poverty. Furthermore, illustrative simulations for Latin American countries suggest that these impacts are economically quite significant, and highlight the growth acceleration and inequality reduction that would result from increased availability and quality of infrastructure."

This paper documents the recent trends in infrastructure stocks and infrastructure investment in major Latin American economies. Using an updated dataset constructed for this task, the paper describes the evolution of the quantity and quality of infrastructure assets – power, transport, telecommunications– as well as the investment expenditures of the public and private sectors. The paper finds that Latin America lags behind the international norm in terms of infrastructure quantity and quality, and there is little evidence that the gap may be closing – except in the telecommunications sector. Furthermore, overall infrastructure investment has fallen, as a combined result of the retrenchment of public investment and the limited response of the private sector, which has been mostly confined to the telecommunications industry. However, there is considerable disparity across countries. On the whole the data show that the countries most successful in attracting large volumes of private investment (Chile, Colombia, Bolivia) are precisely those where public investment has remained high."

We compare two equally binding schemes of single and age-differentiated minimum wages, and find that although differentiated minimum wages result in a more equal distribution of income, such a scheme creates a more unequal distribution of wealth, by forcing less skilled workers to remain longer in the uncovered sector. We also show that relaxing minimum wage solely for young workers may be harmful for less skilled ones."

However, holding reserves is costly. In this paper, we analyze several issues concerning the adequate level of Chilean international reserves. In the first place, we compare the level of Chile’s international reserves with those of different sets of countries using various indicators. We then analyze empirically some of the benefits and costs of holding reserves. Our results show that Chile’s international reserves are high when measured with respect to GDP or M2, but they are in line with those of countries of similar characteristics when measured as a fraction of short-term residual debt. On the other hand, given the low risk of the Chilean economy, marginal changes in reserves have a very low impact on both the probability of a financial crisis and the sovereign spread of the country. Finally, as the sovereign spread has decreased over the last years, so too has the cost of reserves. In fact, by the end of 2002, and despite having a high reserves-to-GDP ratio, the cost of reserves as a fraction of GDP was considerably lower than the cost of other emerging economies."

This paper quantifies their economic effects for the Chilean economy, stemming from the conventional trade components (lower tariffs and higher market access) and other aspects of the latter broad FTAs, including improved intellectual property rights, factor productivity gains, and their fiscal consequences (tax compensation, larger customs expenditure). The paper also considers that the country risk premium may decline and aggregate investment may rise in response to the institutional stability and policy credibility enhanced by the FTAs. Simulation results are reported for steady states and dynamic transition paths, based on a three-sector dynamic general equilibrium model for an open economy inhabited by infinitely-lived representative agents. The model is calibrated to the Chilean economy and the actual features of both trade agreements. Due to Chile’s high initial trade openness, the reported effects of FTAs on resource allocations, relative prices, expenditure composition, welfare, output, and aggregate consumption do not exceed 1% in any given period. On impact, the largest gains come from a lower risk premium that leads to a temporary consumption and investment boom, which is reverted in the long run as a result of larger net foreign liabilities. In steady state, the gains from improved factor productivity dominate all other effects."

Using an error-correction model, the results show that unemployment lags have a negative and statistically significant sort-run impact on consumption growth. Three hypotheses that relate unemployment and consumption are also analyzed. First, it is shown that unemployment is not a good predictor of future disposable income. Therefore, it does not signal changes in permanent income. Moreover, the results do not support the implications of the certainty-equivalence version of the permanent income hypothesis. Second, there is evidence that unemployment affects income volatility. Hence, the relationship between unemployment and consumption could be explained by the precautionary savings motive. However, for this mechanism to be consistent with the fact that unemployment has a negative impact on consumption growth, the effect of uncertainty on consumption must be persistent. Finally, there is also evidence that unemployment could affect consumption through its effect on income distribution. However, the latter result is not robust."

Its main contribution is the recognition of the role played by transparency and public announcements in the success of the intervention policy, through the existence of an expectations mechanism which directly impacts the exchange rate. Three foreign exchange policy instruments are distinguished –spot, dollar denominated papers (BCD´s) and announcements- and treated as independent interventions. Time series estimations are used to capture the effect of the traditionally studied spot interventions, as well as the effects associated to the announcement channel that we propose as potentially relevant. Results show that the impact of individual interventions (spot and BCD) are extremely small and, in most cases, non-significant. Also, the importance of the hypothesized announcement mechanism is confirmed. The impact of Central Bank actions on the exchange rate’s level and trend seem to be channeled through the public announcements made by the monetary authority. The market adjusts its expectations to the information revealed through them, with the exchange rate responding accordingly. These effects occur on longer time spans than the ones suggested by the traditional literature. The negligible effect of individual interventions is also found, for the year 2001, with the use of intraday data."

The model specifies short-run dynamics as well as long-run equilibrium conditions. Cointegration and error correction techniques are used to estimate the relevant parameters, while some relations are calibrated. The model includes the main components of aggregate demand and external accounts, a supply-side block that relies on a standard production function, a specification for asset prices, and a wage/markup/price and labor market block. The short- and long run interdependence among each of these factors is taken into account to yield a forward-looking macroeconomic dynamic equilibrium. The key steadystate relative prices, such as the long-run real interest rate, the real exchange rate, and the sovereign risk premium, are endogenously determined. The model is used to explore and quantify the effects of monetary policy on inflation and how monetary policy is transmitted to inflation. The results obtained here are compared to the results of other simpler but less informative models, such as VAR and a smaller scale macroeconomic model, based on Phillips curves.

The inclusion of a target for the real exchange rate in the policy reaction function of the Central Bank could be important if the monetary authority is concerned about fluctuations in the current account. The results show that the alternative policy can help to reduce the volatility of the external accounts and in some case it can also help to reduce the volatility of the output gap. However, this policy introduces more volatility in inflation and it also makes the convergence of this variable to its steady state level slower."

This paper discusses the role of factor accumulation and the efficiency with which factors are used, measured as total factor productivity (TFP), to explain the evolution of output in Chile during the past 20 years. In contrast with the experience of the 1980s and early 1990s, in recent years the primary determinant of the drop in output growth has not been a decline in TFP, but a severe fall in employment. Using a calibrated dynamic general equilibrium model based on the neoclassical growth model, with fluctuations in factor inputs induced by changes in TFP and relative input prices, we conclude that a 6.17% increase in the cost of labor hiring replicates the observed fall in employment. This fall, in turn, could be attributed to a perceived higher cost of labor services associated to both the significant increase in the minimum wage observed between 1998 and 2000, and a labor code reform, intensively debated during the 1999- 2002 period."

Welfare implications are also analyzed for a central bank that it is concerned with output and inflation volatility. Our findings show that OD results in: higher real volatility due to the absence of ountercyclical monetary policy; lower inflation volatility because of a less volatile foreign interest rate; and, from a welfare perspective, OD is dominated by a FER when the central bank weighs considerably the deviations of inflation and output from the steady state. Also, OD implies higher fiscal deficit volatility as a consequence of higher tax revenue volatility, and a higher reaction to terms-of-trade shocks."

We also discuss the role of quality of education and differences in inequality between the two regions. Balance-of-payments crisis shocks have also contributed significantly to differences in growth performance. Analysis reveals that growth rates tend to fall only temporarily following a balance-of-payments crisis and then rebound to the pre-crisis levels, producing the typical v-type pattern for output in both East Asia and Latin America. However, a balance-of-payments crisis is often associated with a large decline of growth rates and develops into another crisis in the future.

Chile’s agreements with “Northern” partners provide sufficient market access to overcome trade diversion costs for Chile. By lowering its tariff from eleven to six percent, Chile is able to reduce trade diversion from all its regional agreements. This converts MERCOSUR from a negative to a positive agreement. Due to preferential market access, additive regionalism is likely to provide Chile with gains that are many multiples of the static welfare gains from unilateral free trade. We find that at least one partner country loses from each of the regional agreements we consider, and excluded countries as a group always lose. Gains to the world from global free trade are estimated to be vastly larger than any of the regional arrangements."

However it has been traditionally argued that emerging economies are unable to adopt counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policy. Here we argue that the cyclical properties of macroeconomic policies depend critically on policy credibility. We test this proposition by making use of recent panel data for eleven emerging market economies and time-series data for Chile. The evidence supports that countries with higher credibility, as reflected by lower country risk levels, are able to conduct countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies. Conversely, countries with less credible policies (and, therefore, with higher country risk spreads) contribute to larger cyclical fluctuations by applying pro-cyclical policies. For Chile we find that both monetary and fiscal policies have been largely counter-cyclical after 1993."

A working metric of the “too big to fail” situation can be derived in the model.

Controlling for bank specific fixed effects, and for bank and market characteristics, we test whether banks with a pension fund affiliation had overall different pricing strategies with respect to non-affiliated banks, whether these banks display a different response to monetary policy changes and whether they reacted differently during the 1998 liquidity shock to the Chilean economy. The evidence suggests that banks with pension fund affiliation display a broader deposit and loan base and enjoy higher interest rate spreads, but they seem to react similarly to monetary policy changes with respect to banks that have no affiliation to pension funds. Finally, the evidence collected for the period around the liquidity shock indicates that banks with pension fund affiliation enjoyed some degree of insulation from market events, attracting a larger share of funds at the expense of other banks and posting higher spreads while those of other banks were shrinking."

In contrast to these first-order effects, the stability implications of increased entry are less obvious. This paper investigates whether greater integration resulting from foreign bank entry has been associated with more or less business cycle volatility. We approach the topic with mix of theory and evidence from both the U.S. states and countries. While theoretical effects are mixed, the empirical effect of relaxation of restrictions of cross-state banking has been to stabilize state-level fluctuations in the U.S. Applying a related set of tests to a panel of about 100 countries, however, we find no evidence that expansion of foreign banking has reduced business fluctuations.

The combined effects of the tariff reductions (TLCs with the US, the European Union and Korea) and the planned VAT increase are almost neutral from a fiscal point of view. Nevertheless, under reasonable assumptions, the effect of the increase in VAT on inflation should be around half percentage point during the last quarter of 2003. This estimation assumes that inflation expectations remain unchanged, that markups suffer a mild long run compression, and that wage indexation to CPI is in place. The tariff reduction with the US should induce one tenth of a percentage point of lower annual inflation during 2004. This magnitude is similar to the estimated effect of the tariff reduction with the European Community that is already incorporated into inflation forecasts. The combined effect on annual inflation of the VAT increase and the tariff reduction with the USA is expected to be slightly below 0,5% during 2004. As for any forecast, the figures presented above are subject to important degrees of uncertainty. These numbers can be smaller if markups compress further or even go as high as 1% if credibility is lost. Monthly inflation before, during and right after the change in VAT will be highly informative with respect to alternative scenarios. Naturally, the incoming information can lead to a change in the estimations presented here. Particularly important will be the inflation rate of the month of October, when the impact effect of the increased VAT will be felt."

While we find no significant evidence of asymmetry in Chile’s pass-through across states of the interest rate or monetary policy cycle, we do find some evidence of parameter instability, around the time of the Asian and Russian crises. However, we do not find evidence that the switch to a more flexible exchange rate regime in 1999 and the “nominalization” of Chile’s interest rate targets in 2001 have affected significantly the pass-through process."

Positive nominal shocks produce an appreciation of RER that lasts five months. The effect of real shocks depends on the nature of the shocks.

Together with a home traded goods sector we incorporate a non-traded goods sector. In both sectors prices are sticky, and each one is subject to a specific productivity shock. In this setup the flexible price allocation can not be reached by means of a single monetary policy instrument. Therefore, the central bank faces a trade-off between stabilizing inflation in the Nontraded sector and in the home goods sector. In this context, and when the share of non-traded goods is not too high, a simple Taylor rule outperforms a strict inflation-targeting regime. However, both policy rules are dominated by a rule that moves aggressively the interest rate in response to deviation in core inflation. On the other hand, if the share of non-traded goods is high then the model converges to the closed economy case, and, in absence of an exogenous cost push shock, the optimal policy is to completely stabilize consumer price inflation."

We find several results that are of interest to policymakers in emerging countries, such as Brazil, Chile and Mexico, which have revamped their monetary and exchange rate arrangements along those lines. First, the adoption of a floating exchange rate and an IT framework are associated with a persistent 10% to 20% reduction in real official reserves held at the Central Bank. Second, this reduction in official reserves corresponds mainly to a reallocation of international liquidity towards the private financial sector, that accommodates part of the effect on the level or composition of the net foreign asset position of the countries. Third, there is a clear change in the correlation between interest rate differentials and the dynamics of official reserves, strongly supporting the Mundell-Fleming result regarding the exogeneity of money supply under floating exchange rates. Fourth, the latter also shows that, once constraints on exchange rate volatility are removed, the stock of reserves can be determined independently by the Central Bank, according to cost-benefit analysis, without hindering the credibility of the combination of a floating regime and inflation targeting."

According to the existing literature, Chile’s system can best be described as an “insider” one. Large groups organized in a pyramidal fashion typically control publicly traded companies. In spite of this, corporate governance discriminates moderately against small shareholders or outsiders (e.g. bondholders). Some of the reasons behind this are the monitoring role of some financial institutions, such as AFPs (pension fund managers), the insurance and banking regulation, and an active supervisory agency. However, since the onset of the 1997-98 world financial crisis, Chilean capital markets have been gloomy. Capital outflows from the region have not been the only cause, but also a number of large takeovers of domestic corporations by multinationals and some well publicized cases of rent extraction from minority parties are to blame. In an attempt to revive a flagging market, some vices in corporate practices have been corrected (partially) by the enacting of the so-called “Ley de OPA” (PTO law) in December 2000. This law is aimed at protecting of minority shareholders’ rights.

When a bank faces insolvency, it has incentives to continue sub-optimal projects in its portfolio, retarding or clutching the necessary process of creative destruction, which leads to sluggish economic performance. Considering three sectors, asymmetric information and agency problems, it is shown how the original magnitude of a generalized adverse shock can be amplified by the banking sector. The motivation of this study is provided by the current symptoms of the Japanese banking sector and the Chilean experience of the early 80´s debt crisis. These episodes show clear signals that validate the mechanisms identified by the theory, and suggest some measures to face crisis periods on a proper manner."

However, these findings could be biased due to the omission of relevant control variables and the simultaneity between interventions and the exchange rate. Time series estimates are used to deal with these potential problems. Statistical evidence of weak exogeneity between intervention and exchange rate shows that the potential endogeneity problem is not relevant given the purpose of the paper. OLS estimations suggest that the effect of daily interventions are not statistically different from zero in 2001, but that the public announcements of the beginning of an intervention period did have an effect in the level and trend of the exchange rate in that year, as well as in 2002-2003.

The author challenges the conventional interpretation of empirical results, arguing that current econometric practice has yielded a body of evidence that is not policy relevant. Extending his own previous work, the author raises two issues of critical importance for policy purposes. First, policy recommendations arising from growth regressions are usually based on the statistical significance of some regression coefficients, which does not necessarily constitute a valid evaluation of alternative policy trajectories. Moreover, the statistical significance of a parameter does not provide information on the relative merit of it for policymakers’ objectives. Second, growth regressions as conventionally constructed do not provide credible evidence of economic structure. Consequently, policymakers are unable to make better decisions based only on regression results. The author proposes an alternative approach to the interpretation of growth regression based on Bayesian averaging techniques, which allow the weighing of different growth determinants relative to the pay-off function of the policymaker and in the context of model uncertainty (because the modeler does not know what growth determinants must be included in a model or what forms of country-level heterogeneity need to be accounted for in the model)."

This was a rather turbulent period in economic history, and as such, it motivates to carry on research on the likely causes of the slowdown and its possible solutions. The authors use an econometric model to test three competing hypotheses and derive general implications from the analysis. The first hypothesis puts the blame on bad luck, because of external shocks: namely, terms-of-trade losses and reduced capital inflows following the Asian crisis. A second hypothesis blames the slowdown on policies implemented as a response to the deteriorating external conditions, in particular the inability to achieve a balanced mix of monetary and fiscal policies during the 1997–1998 period. Fiscal imbalances and restrictive monetary policy, it is argued, led to very high interest rates, severely affecting the investment and consumption decisions of the private sector. Finally, a third explanation is that the lowdown resulted from the completion of a high growth cycle associated with the structural reforms introduced in the 1985–1995 period. The authors conclude that the slowdown in the Chilean economy was a mix of severe external shocks and lack of cooperation between fiscal and monetary policies."

Rather than revisiting previous studies, it complements previous research by providing, for the first time, empirical evidence on some of the microeconomic effects of capital controls, in particular, the unremunerated reserve requirement (URR). By looking at financial statements for a group of 73 Chilean firms during 1986-2001, the paper attempts to identify the effects of the URR on the firms’ costs and ways of financing. Chilean firms are grouped by economic sector, size and access to international capital markets. Results show that the effects of the URR are firm specific; forinstance, there are striking differences in the response to the URR among firms of different size and those with or without access to international capital markets."

This has been advocated to assert that such monetary growth is inconsistent with the inflation target. This work is intended to prove such an argument wrong. First, we present episodes occurred in other lower-inflation countries, where monetary aggregates have grown even faster than in Chile, without resulting in higher inflation. Second, we show that money trends are consistent with money demand estimates, although these are very volatile. Finally, we explain why in the context of a monetary policy based on inflation targeting, where the policy instrument is the interest rate, it is possible for money to fluctuate widely without jeopardizing the inflation target. Even if inflation is associated to an excessive increase in the amount of money, and monetary policy is neutral over the long term, monetary aggregates provide little information on inflationary pressures."

After reviewing the arguments for and against dollarization, this paper explores its implications on the volatility of the main macroeconomic variables of an emerging small open economy that faces terms-of-trade shocks. Dynamic equilibrium models are used as laboratories to study these issues and contrast two environments: a partially dollarized economy with flexible exchange rate (calibrated for the Peruvian economy) and a fully dollarized economy. Simulation exercises are performed to analyze in both cases the volatility of key variables such as output, consumption, investment, inflation rate, and fiscal deficit. The conclusions are that full dollarization implies (1) higher real volatility, especially on output and investment; (2) lower inflation volatility; (3) higher fiscal deficit volatility; (4) higher output response to terms-of-trade shocks. Consequently, in this context it is difficult to affirm that dollarization reduces country risk. Finally, the paper points up the role of price stickiness and countercyclical monetary policy in these findings."

It concludes that forecast errors during the last few years have been smaller than those committed by the Bank in the past, and that although the errors in forecasting growth are marginally larger than those committed by private forecasters, they are substantially smaller in the case of inflation. Moreover, the performance of MPR forecasts is similar to those of other Central Banks, in particular when considering the different volatilities of GDP growth and inflation across countries. Although the volatility of MPR forecasts is comparable to those of other Central Banks, in the case of growth the sign of the change in the forecast has been more persistent in the case of Chile."

This paper analyses, both conceptually and empirically, the main effects of MPR nominalization on financial markets and the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy.

However, both criteria are endogenous. Frankel and Rose (1998) find that trade intensity increases cycle correlation among industrial countries. We study whether the same result holds true for the case of developing countries, as their different patterns of international trade and specialization may lead to cyclical asymmetries among them and between industrial and developing countries. We gather annual information for 147 countries for 1960-99 (33676 country pairs) and find: (i) countries with higher bilateral trade exhibit higher business cycle synchronization, with an increase of one standard deviation in bilateral trade intensity raising the utput correlation from 0.05 to 0.09 for all country pairs; (ii) countries with more asymmetric structures of production exhibit a smaller business cycle correlation; (iii) the impact of trade integration on business cycles is higher for industrial countries than both developing and the industrial-developing country pairs; (iv) a one standard deviation increase in bilateral trade intensity leads to surges in output correlation from 0.25 to 0.39 among industrial countries, from 0.08 to 0.10 for our sample of industrial-developing country pairs, and from 0.03 to 0.06 among developing countries; (v) the impact of trade intensity on cycle correlation is smaller the greater the production structure asymmetries between the countries."

 """,2002.,Fiscal and Monetary Policy Coordination in EMU,"194, Central Bank of Chile.","The purpose of this paper is to analyze and discuss the coordination of fiscal and monetary policies in EMU. In section 2, we develop a framework for studying monetary and fiscal policy in a monetary union to explore the implications of the common currency for policy coordination. We show that there is little need for coordinating monetary and fiscal policies in the long run. In section 3, we study the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies in the short run. A monetary policy firmly committed to price stability at the EMU level implies that the central bank controls aggregate output at the euro-area level, while national fiscal policies determine the distribution of aggregate demand across the participating countries. Thus, national governments are engaged in a purely distributional game with inefficient outcomes unless policies are coordinated. If monetary policy also pursues a goal of output stabilization, policy coordination should include the central bank together with the fiscal authorities. We also show that the proposal to restrict fiscal policies to the operation automatic stabilizers at the national level, which is now often made in EMU, does not solve the issue of policy coordination. Instead, it worsens the situation of the central bank unless automatic stabilizers are identical in all member economies. In section 4, we review the existing mechanisms for policy coordination and show that they are deficient, since they focus on the long run rather than the short run and largely ignore the interdependence of national economic policies and the ECB’s monetary policy.

 """,2002.,"Growth, Integration, and Macroeconomic Policy Design: Some Lessons for Latin America","192, Central Bank of Chile.","Even the richest countries face the ongoing challenge of how to combine monetary and fiscal discipline with sustainable growth. Increasingly, it is recognized that growth requires not merely factor accumulation but the appropriate market and political institutions. Rich countries are rich partly because of their past success in resolving these issues. This paper gives an overview of economic performance in Latin America, showing output growth, inflation, and the evolution of budget deficits. Then, it introduces a simple model, based on Begg (2000, 2001), capturing the interaction of macroeconomic policy and structural reform. Reform is costly today but improves future opportunities. These benefits may apply to means or variances. By increasing robustness to shocks, reforms that enhance labor market flexibility reduce the variance of output. Other reforms, by affecting means not variances, reduce systematic distortions that depress potential output. Finally, it examines the optimal speed of reform under different macroeconomic regimes, and hence isolates the effects of the choice of regime on the pace of reform. In general, in more distorted countries (or regimes) the benefit of reform is greater. Hence, regimes that inefficiently mitigate distortions should induce faster reform. Consequently, if dollarization or other policy changes reduce distortions, they should (optimally) slow the pace of reform."

This index is calculated using the number of jobs offered in newspapers’ advertisements of the 5 main urban areas. This information, in addition with employment and labor force data, is used to draw and estimate a Beveridge Curve (CB). We used this curve to analyze the sources of unemployment volatility. The stability of the curve along the sample is a signal of the anticyclical trayectory of the unemployment. On the other hand, shifts in this curve allow to conclude that unbalanced shocks have affected the labor market. The main conclusions of this paper are: i) the index is reasonably unbiased, despite of the fact that some statistical problems were not completely corrected; ii) there is no evidence to reject the stability of the CB (or the anticyclical behavior of the unemployment) at the national level during the sample, including the recent period; iii) in the context of an impulse-response analysis, a transitory innovation of vacancies has permanent impact on employment; iv) the index may be considered as a leader indicator of GDP (in one quarter) and employment (in half a year); v) these aggregated results are strongly influenced by the high weight of Santiago (the Capital) over the total; vi) outside the Capital, the CB seems to have been more unstable, specially in Concepción-Talcahuano and Temuco (both located in the South of the country), suffering a shift in the early 90s. However, it is not possible to conclude that these displacements are caused by sample problems in the data, by sectorial shocks or by non-linearity in the employment-vacancies elasticity."

A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model is formulated, solved and calibrated to evaluate its ability to replicate the main features of the Chilean economy in the 1986-2000 period. In particular, it focuses on a possible explanation to what the empirical literature calls the ""price puzzle"", the co-movement between interest rate and inflation. The solution of the model is adequately achieved through a perturbation method (second-order approximation). A positive transitory policy interest rate shock causes: (1) a temporary (non-significant) decline in output, (2) a decrease in real money balances, and (3) a temporary increase in the inflation rate. These findings are relatively consistent with those obtained from impulse-response functions estimated for Chile. Therefore, the theoretical model proposed is able to explain and reproduce the co-movement between interest rate and inflation. This relationship is caused by a Fisher effect and strengthened by the presence of a Taylor rule that depends positively on inflation deviation from its steady state equilibrium."

 """,2002.,Infrastructure Compression and Public Sector Solvency in Latin America,"187, Central Bank of Chile.","Public investment and infrastructure spending are often singled out for drastic cuts at times of fiscal retrenchment. Fiscal austerity in Latin America during the 1980s and 1990s was characterized by a sharp contraction in infrastructure spending. In 5 of the 9 major Latin American countries, infrastructure investment cuts contributed half or more of the total fiscal adjustment. However, the compression of infrastructure spending does not guarantee the sustainability of the public sector. Infrastructure spending cuts not only reduce the public deficit (thereby raising the public sector’s net worth) but also leads to a decline in infrastructure stock accumulation and in output growth as well. This in turn implies a reduction in the economy’s debt-servicing capacity, thus weakening the public sector net worth (Easterly, 2001). In the present paper we quantitatively assess the growth cost of public infrastructure compression for major Latin American economies during the fiscal austerity period of the 1980s and 1990s, and examine the effectiveness of infrastructure spending cuts as a device to enhance public sector solvency."

For instance, Latin America’s infrastructure gap in infrastructure growth relative to that of the seven successful economies of East Asia grew by 40-50 percent for road length, 50-60 percent for telecommunications, and as much as 90-100 percent in terms of power generation capacity over the 1980-97 period. The consequences of this loss of ground or growth and welfare in the region are a matter of concern. Lack of adequate infrastructure services results in lower productivity and higher production costs for private producers. Poor road and telecommunication networks raise transport and, more generally, logistic costs, which have been shown in comparative studies to exceed the international norm by wide margins (Guasch, 2001). The reduced profitability in turn discourages private investment. Through all these channels, the result is lower output growth. As with infrastructure, Latin America’s loss of ground was particularly marked in the 1980s. We find evidence of a strong empirical association between output and infrastructure although this need not reflect causation from infrastructure services to aggregate output. The present paper wants to determine the role of Latin America’s growing infrastructure gap in the widening of the output gap. We devote our efforts in this paper to answer this question."

Second, we look at trends in infrastructure spending for 9 major Latin American countries on which we have country data. Here we examine to what extent changes in public infrastructure spending were linked to fiscal deficit reductions and driven by the privatization of infrastructure and increased private spending on infrastructure.

In this paper, we evaluate the wisdom of those decisions and the choice of monetary regime more generally. We first evaluate the desirability of adopting a common currency in the region. We find that, under present circumstances, the costs of a common currency are likely to outweigh its benefits, as these countries do not trade much with each other and, moreover, they face diverse economic shocks, their business cycles are not coordinated, and they are affected by common shocks to sentiment in international financial markets only to the same extent than the average pair of emerging markets. We next consider the unilateral dollarization option. For most Latin American countries, this would be desirable only when there are strong links to the US economy, the credibility of the monetary authorities is irreversibly lost, and there is a keen demand for dollar-denominated financial assets. Finally, we review the relatively short experience of floating exchange regimes in Latin America and find that, despite the external constraints, floating countries have retained sufficient flexibility to use monetary policy for domestic ends in response to important shocks."

We also find that dollarized nations have had a lower rate of economic growth than non-dollarized ones. Finally, we find that macroeconomic volatility is not significantly different across dollarized and non-dollarized economies.

This rise in FDI volume was accompanied by a marked change in its composition: investment taking the form of acquisition of existing assets (M&A) grew much more rapidly than investment in mainly new assets (‘greenfield’ FDI), particularly in countries undertaking extensive privatization of public enterprises. This raises two issues. First, is the M&A boom a one-time effect of privatization, or is it likely to be followed by a rise in greenfield investment? Second, do these two types of FDI have different macroeconomic consequences – in terms of aggregate investment and growth? This paper focuses on establishing the stylized facts in terms of time precedence between both types of FDI, investment and growth using data for a large sample of industrial and developing countries. We find that in developing and industrial countries higher M&A is typically followed by higher greenfield investment, while the reverse is true only for industrial countries. In developing economies domestic investment leads both types of FDI, but not the reverse; while in industrial countries, domestic investment leads M&A FDI but is led by greenfield FDI. Neither type of FDI appears to precede economic growth in either developing or industrial countries, but FDI does respond positively to increases in the growth rate."

This paper reviews the recent IT experiences of Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, applying a common empirical framework to the three country cases. Inflation performance under IT and its associated output costs are reported and compared favorably to a control group of other countries. The paper analyzes ways by which IT has contributed to strengthen credibility: the effect of targets on inflation expectations and on actual inflation, the low influence of inflation shocks on core inflation, and the decline in inflation forecast errors. Do the three inflation targeters exhibit fear of floating? No, considering their relatively large exchange rate volatility and moderate international reserve holdings. No, considering strongly declining inflation-to-devaluation passthrough coefficients and little evidence for monetary policy reaction to exchange rate shocks. Yes, considering the frequency and intensity of sterilized exchange interventions in comparison to other inflation targeters that float more cleanly."

 """,2002.,Evaluation of the P900 Program: A Targeted Education Program for Underperforming Schools,"170, Central Bank of Chile.","Education policies targeted at the worst performing schools are controversial. Its positive discrimination nature has been debated, while the lack of serious empirical evaluation has frozen the discussion at a highly theoretical level. The biggest problem has been to identify unbiased effects, given non-random participation even within underperforming schools. This paper contributes to the debate by evaluating the P900 program - that provides material support to low-achieving Chilean schools- estimating effects that are free of bias due to unmeasured fixed school-specific effects, which are correlated with participation. It explicitly considers the changing nature of both the program and the selection process, computing yearly effects and biases. The simplifying assumptions usually found in the literature (e.g. constant program effects, bias, and school effects) are tested and rejected, thus shedding doubts on previous findings. The paper finds that schools were selected for the P900 in an unobserved compensatory manner, thus downward biasing uncontrolled estimates. Moreover, the bias and the estimated effects of the Program are increasing in time. The 1992 program is not significantly different from zero, while the 1994 and 1996 program´s are significantly positive. The latter is significantly higher than the rest, thus it would be effectively helping the schools that participate in it."

Subsidized loans, variable taxes and differentiated tariffs are frequently used. Because of the successful experiences of some South Asian industrial policies, other emerging countries feel tempted of replicating the formula. However, these should be sure first that their governments have the necessary competencies. There are also two questions to ask on the role of IPs in the growth of these countries: first, Were IPs the dominant factor in the countries’ accelerated growth? The neoclassical approach offers an alternative explanation, that the Asian miracle was mainly the result of strong macroeconomic policies implemented. The second question is: Can the problems of some Asian economies in the 1990s be explained by the prolonged application of IPs? This article finds evidence to support that economic growth was due to strong macroeconomic foundations, such as fiscal discipline, controlled inflation and adequate real exchange rate levels. These variables were the driving forces that created high levels of saving and investment. On the other hand, the implementation of IPs is difficult in a globalized world where the regulations of international trade have become very important."

The present study emphasizes instead some quality dimensions of economic development, including health, fertility, income distribution, political institutions, crime, and religion. The data reveal a regular pattern in which economic development goes along with higher life expectancy and reduced fertility. Improvements in the standard of living are also associated with expansions of democracy, increased maintenance of the rule of law, and reductions in official corruption. Despite the presence of a Kuznets curve, little of the variations in income inequality are explained by the overall level of economic development. Crime rates, proxied by murder rates, also bear little relation with the level of development but are more closely associated with income inequality. Finally, there is some support for the secularization hypothesis, in that economic development is typically accompanied by lower levels of church attendance and religious beliefs. However, religiosity is positively related to education, holding fixed other indicators of economic development."

We also conclude that the Stability Pact is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for EMU to succeed and that EMU has been driven by political considerations. A sound financial sector is a precondition. With regard to lessons to be drawn for Latin America and the Caribbean we first find that there has been a strong push towards the floating cum inflation-targeting corner and to regional trade integration. Moreover, it seems that, in contrast to EMU, the benefit-cost balance of a move to monetary union is much less favorable in Latin America and the Caribbean and, most important, the political dimension missing."

(4) Economic activity is highly concentrated, with all factors of production flowing to the richest areas. (5) National policies closely associated with long-run economic growth rates. We argue that these facts do not support models with diminishing returns, constant returns to scale, some fixed factor of production, and that highlight the role of factor accumulation. Empirical work, however, does not yet decisively distinguish among the different theoretical conceptions of “total factor productivity growth.” Economists should devote more effort towards modeling and quantifying total factor productivity."

This paper reviews macroeconomic management in emerging economies and the role of the international financial institutions in helping to secure their stability. It discusses the role of macroeconomic policies, in particular exchange rate policies, arguing that a very strong case can be made for exchange rate flexibility. However, as recent evidence confirms, this choice requires an institutional framework that credibly commits the economy to low inflation, preventing price instability even in the presence of strong fluctuations in the exchange rate. Also discussed is the role of the international financial institutions in a world of recurrent currency crises and contagion. Despite the need for increased transparency, accountability, and greater independence for the International Monetary Fund, to avoid its being seen as an institution that primarily serves the political goals of its main shareholders, and despite the need for improved procedures to handle crises, the best recipe for stability is at the domestic level. Good macroeconomic policies are those that bring about low inflation, fiscal prudence, and a strong financial system: these are necessary and almost sufficient conditions to avoid the type of crisis experienced repeatedly in the last decade. However, strong institutions must support this set of policies. The ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy is to serve as the basis for prosperity and for improving the well-being of the entire population, and here there is no substitute for macroeconomic stability."

Without considering sales agents, social welfare is the same under a two-part tariff regime as under single pricing, but the distribution of surplus is different.

Furthermore, the research activities of the central banks in the European Union over the period 1990-99 will be analyzed both in terms of input (economics and research staff) and output (quality-weighted number of articles in scientific journals). The share of economics research staff in total staff of the national central banks varies between 0.02 and 0.17. The ECB has the highest ratio between economists and researchers and other staff. A ranking of research performance based on the quality-weighted number of scientific articles per economics and research employee reveals that the Bank of Finland has the best research performance of European central banks, followed by De Nederlandsche Bank, the Banco de Portugal and the Oesterreichische Nationalbank.

The rapid but unstable growth process in developing countries and their relatively less developed market structure pose a formidable challenge to neoclassical general equilibrium models. Using data of the Chilean economy, we explore the effects of market rigidities and macroeconomic policies on the dynamics of consumption, investment, inflation and factor markets. We find that business cycles models replicate much of the observed fluctuations of real and monetary variables in the Chilean economy, despite its idiosyncratic economic structure. Using a calibrated model we find that technology shocks, fiscal policies and labor market rigidities are the main sources of economic cycles, while monetary policies and wage indexation play a minor role. Econometric tests support the use of our calibrated model as an adequate representation of the Chilean data."

In the first one, which could be called the neoclassical approach, its main determinant is the user cost of capital. In the second one, which is called the Tobin Q model, investment is determined by the relation between the market value of capital and its replacement cost. The estimated equations are derived from these two models. The best out–of–sample forecasts are obtained for machine and equipment with the user cost model and for construction with the Q model.

We show that business cycles cannot be considered as temporary deviations from a trend and that there is a strong positive correlation between the persistence of short-term fluctuations and long-term growth rates. A simple endogenous growth model where business cycles affect growth can easily replicate this correlation. We then study the link between volatility and growth. We show that countries with more volatile fluctuations display lower long-term growth rates. We also find evidence that there is a non-linearity in this relationship. The effect of business cycles on growth is much larger for poor countries or countries with a lower degree of financial development.

 """,2002.,Coping with Chile’s External Vulnerability: A Financial Problem,"154, Central Bank of Chile.","With traditional domestic imbalances long under control, the Chilean business cycle is driven by external shocks. Most importantly, Chile’s external vulnerability is primarily a financial problem. A decline in the Chilean terms of trade, for example, is associated to a decline in real GDP that is many times larger than one would predict in the presence of perfect financial markets. The financial nature of this excess-sensitivity has two central dimensions: a sharp contraction in Chile’s access to international financial markets when it needs it the most; and an inefficient reallocation of this scarce access across domestic borrowers during external crises. In this paper I characterize this financial mechanism and argue that Chile’s aggregate volatility can be reduced significantly by fostering the private sector’s development of financial instruments that are contingent on Chile’s main external shocks. As a first step, the Central Bank or IFIs could issue a benchmark instrument contingent on these shocks. I also advocate a countercyclical monetary policy but mainly for incentive —that is, as a substitute for taxes on capital inflows and equivalent measures— rather than for ex-post liquidity purposes."

The main objective of the present paper is to tackle these empirical issues by applying the recently developed panel cointegration techniques to the long-run real exchange rate equation implied by our model. Using annual data for 67 countries over the 1966-97, we find that the cointegrating relationship between the real exchange rate, the ratio of net foreign assets to GDP, the relative Home to Foreign productivity of the traded and non-traded sector, and the terms of trade is valid in the long run. This result holds for all sub-sample of countries (whether they are classified by income per capita or capital controls). Furthermore, our coefficient estimates are consistent with the theoretical values implied by the calibrated parameters of preferences and technology in Stockman and Tesar (1995). Robustness checks reveal that: (i) “pooling” the data to obtain a common long-run equilibrium relationship across countries is valid for the samples of countries with high income and low capital controls, (ii) the oil shock crisis in 1973 represents a structural change for these sub-samples. Finally, deviations from the equilibrium are large and persistent with half-life estimates (between 2.8 and 5) consistent with the consensus interval of 2.5-5 found in the literature (Murray and Papell, 2002)."

The quest for a reasonable exchange rate policy has been inspired in part by the different goals that, through this four decades, policy makers have attempted to achieve with this policy. After almost of decade of co-existence of inflation targeting and an exchange rate band, in 1999 the Central Bank of Chile gave up the exchange rate band and replaced it with a policy of floating. This paper confronts two main questions: (a) Why was the band abandoned and, by the same token, why it took so long to do it and (b) How has the floating regime worked so far? This last question involves accounting for the possible appearance of “fear of floating” by the macroeconomic authorities, as well as evaluating the regime in three issues highlighted by the critics of exchange rate floating: passthrough to domestic prices, exchange rate volatility and balance sheet effects. In the final section, the paper illustrates the operation of the exchange rate system in the face of regional contagion effects."

The focus is on (i) the length of the transmission lags from monetary policy to prices; (ii) the impact of monetary policy on output and real exchange rate; and (iii) the magnitude of pass-through coefficient. Second, we estimated four VAR models for the Chilean economy: three of them have short-run restrictions (SVAR) and the other one has long-run restrictions (VEC). Our estimations are different from other studies since we use an adjusted interest rate to consider the episodes of 1998, where the interbank interest rate was substantially higher than the monetary policy rate (MPR) announced by the Central Bank. This allows us to obtain a more precise identification of the monetary policy, thus the impact of this policy on prices and output was much lower than the effect found by other authors. Therefore, the monetary-transmission mechanism is characterized as follows; given a 100 basis points shock to interest rate during a quarter, inflation rate decreases by –0.2%, output by –0.4%, and there is a temporary appreciation of the real exchange rate by 0.4%. Additionally, monetary policy reaches its maximum effect between a year and a year and a half. On the other hand, pass-through coefficient turned out to be low and close to 18% after two years."

On the one hand, the empirical growth literature finds a positive effect of financial depth as measured by, for instance, private domestic credit and liquid liabilities (e.g., Levine, Loayza, and Beck 2000). On the other hand, the banking and currency crisis literature finds that monetary aggregates, such as domestic credit, are among the best predictors of crises and their related economic downturns (e.g., Kaminski and Reinhart 1999). This paper starts by illustrating these opposing effects by, first, analyzing the dynamics of output growth and financial intermediation around systemic banking crises and, second, showing that the growth enhancing effects of financial depth are weaker in countries that experienced such crises. After these illustrative exercises, the paper attempts an empirical explanation of the apparently opposing effects of financial intermediation. This explanation is based on a distinction between transitory and trend effects of domestic credit aggregates on economic growth. Working with a panel of cross-country and time-series observations, the paper estimates an encompassing model of long- and short-run effects, following Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999)’s Pooled Mean Group Estimator.

The paper then proposes a new linkage between natural resources and economic growth, through saving and investment. When the share of output that accrues to the owners of natural resources rises, the demand for capital falls and this leads to lower real interest rates and less rapid growth. Moreover, the analysis shows that the discrepancy between the privately and socially optimal rates of growth increases with the natural capital share. Empirical evidence from 85 countries from 1965 to 1998 suggests that natural capital may on average crowd out physical as well as human capital, thereby inhibiting economic growth. The results also suggest that, across countries, heavy dependence on natural resources may hurt saving and investment indirectly by slowing down the development of the financial system."

Is the negative effect of natural resource exports (as a share of GDP) sensitive to the time period used in the analysis? 2. Is this result sensitive to unknown omitted variables? 3. Is this result sensitive to endogeneity problems that afflict the traditional cross-sectional growth regressions? The main findings are that the SW result concerning the alleged negative effect of natural resource exports on growth does not pass the test of time, the NRX effect is probably due to unaccounted countryspecific effects, and dealing with endogeneity issues does not recover the SW result. However, we find that export revenue concentration does have quite a robust negative effect on economic growth.

Are there any special conditions in which natural resources can act as the engine of growth? Are natural resources a curse? In this paper we present a model where natural resources have a positive effect on level of income and a negative effect on its growth rate. However, we show that this effect can be ameliorated by having a large level of human capital. We test our model using panel data for the period 1970-1990. We extend the usual specifications for economic growth regressions by incorporating an interaction term between human capital and natural resources, showing that countries high levels of human capital may more than offset the negative effects of the natural resource abundance on growth. We also review the historical experience of Scandinavian countries, which in contrast to Latin America, another region well endowed with natural resources, which shows how it is possible to grow fast based on natural resources. Overall the em pirical evidence is consistent with the main predictions of the model."

This paper presents a simple model to correct the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to obtain a measure of economic income, by subtracting from the Net National Product (NNP) the depreciation of natural capital. Corrected measures of the economic income for the period 1985-1997 are presented, taking into consideration mining and fishing resources and air contamination. The results show that approximately 3% of Chile’s economic income correspond to depreciation of its natural resources plus the cost of atmospheric pollution. In addition, genuine measures of saving are calculated. The results lead to the conclusion that economic growth was sustainable during the period 1985-1997. Important policy implications are obtained for a better management of natural resources in the future."

The empirical evidence from the Chilean banking crisis of the 1980s shows that the rescued banks had higher levels of risk and they were less efficient. However, it is not clear that the higher level of risks were due to moral hazard behavior. I also found that some additional measures mitigated the agency problems.

 """,2002.,On the determinants of the Chilean Economic Growth,"134, Central Bank of Chile.","This paper presents several methodologies for understanding the Chilean growth process. By using univariate time series representations, we find that the Chilean data is more consistent with exogenous than with endogenous growth models. Growth accounting exercises show that the mild growth rates of the sixties are mainly due to the accumulation of human and physical capital, while the booms of the mid seventies and the one from 1985 until 1998 are mainly due to TFP growth. We also find that among the most important determinants of the evolution of TFP are the evolution of terms of trade, improvements on the quality of capital, and the presence of distortions. In fact, distortions do not only eliminate the positive effects of improvements on the quality of capital, but also precede the evolution of technology shocks and increase their volatility. A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that explicitly incorporates the relative price of investment with respect to consumption goods, terms of tra de, and distortionary taxes is able to successfully replicate the impulse-response functions found on the data. This exercise suggests that distortions play a key role in explaining the growth dynamics of the Chilean experience."

The paper supports this with consideration to the fact that the inflation target was an announced, decreasing, and permanent policy. Third, by using an unrestricted VAR, this paper performs dynamic solutions that assume an exogenous and known path for the inflation target. The results indicate that the decreasing inflation target gradually led inflation to the single-digit range without a drop in output.

The criteria to choose among rules and regimes are obtained using a welfare criterion derived from the utility function of the representative agent. The main findings of this paper are that, depending on what shocks affect this economy, the effects of inflation targeting on output and inflation volatility depend crucially on the exchange rate regime and the inflation index being targeted. With regard to the exchange rate, we find that the loss in agents’ welfare is much higher under managed exchange rates than under flexible rates in presence of real shocks, while for nominal shocks the reverse is true. As far as the definition of inflation targeting index is concerned, domestic inflation appears to outperform the CPI. Finally, flexible inflation targeting is welfare superior to strict targeting."

We can conclude from the estimation results: i) exchange-rate pass-through depends positively on economic activity (output gap) explaining why pass-through has been so low in recent years in Chile.

It is shown that this policy, if understood as a strict commitment to a CPI inflation target, shares many features with exchange rate targeting and is quite different from flexible exchange rates under money growth rules. Inflation targets are vulnerable to speculative attacks, although less so than exchange rate targets. They perform worse than exchange rate targets when policy sustainability is limited. And their relative performance under exogenous shocks, not surprisingly, depends on the nature and direction of those shocks. Given this lack of an obvious advantage over exchange rate targets, the real attraction of inflation targets may be that they give the policymaker discretion. This, in the context of many emerging markets, has to be a cause for concern."

In addition to being among the world’s largest banks, they have some of the world’s largest problems. Recent studies have found that Japanese banks have reduced lending as a consequence of these problems, that this shrinkage has been concentrated in their overseas operations, and that this shrinkage has influenced real activity in the United States. Southeast Asian economies, with both a large Japanese bank presence and capital markets less developed than those in the United States, are likely to be even more severely affected by any major retreat by Japanese banks. In addition, given recent problems in many Asian countries, the extent of any Japanese bank retreat might be magnified by host country as well as home country problems. This paper examines Japanese banking activities along three dimensions. First, it documents the expansion and the initial stage of retrenchment of lending by Japanese banks in Southeast Asia. Second, we examine the response of Japanese banks to their problems at home, as exemplified by their lending behavior in Southeast Asia. We evaluate this Japanese bank response relative to that in their home market and in the United States.

Latin American countries, in spite of their more checketed financial past, were much less severely hit at the time (of course, several have had crises since). Why this asymmetry between the two regions? In this paper we argue that what saved Latin America in 1997-98 was not a stronger set of macroeconomic fundamentals (many Latin countries, for instance, had substantial real exchange rate appreciation and non-trivial current account deficits) but a stronger financial position. In contrast, the Asian countries were in a situation of international illiquidity evidenced by sharply rising ratios of hard currency short-term liabilities to liquid assets. As such, they were extremely vulnerable to a reversal of capital inflows, which occurred massively in the second half of 1997. Financial fragility in Asia had its roots in inappropriate microeconomic policies followed during previous years. As we document below, financial liberalization measures in Asia resulted in a deterioration of the international liquidity position of the financial system. These measures, carried out at a time of large capital inflows, created the conditions for a crisis. Much of the borrowing was in dollars and, especially in the period right before the crisis, short term. These two factors left domestic banks exposed to exchange risk and to the mood swings of lenders who had to roll over large loan volumes at short-intervals. By contrast the Latin countries, having gone through their cycle of financial liberalization and collapse in the 1980s and early 1990s, have followed much more cautious policies in recent years."

Checks and balances influence the independence of regulators, the value and cost of special interest payoffs to policy makers, and individual political incentives to avoid collective policy failures.

Reaching the long run goal rate in 1999 and an indisputable reputation as inflation-averse has allowed the Central Bank of Chile to move more into the flexibility side of the credibility-flexibility trade-off. Also, having a third objective in the form of a asymmetric threshold current account deficit did imply in a few episodes setting aside the implicit output stabilizatio goal in the short run.

From an empirical perspective, a quantitative open-economy model is developed and the likelihood of encountering a liquidity trap is explored for several policy rules.

This fact is at odds with classical macroeconomic theories which suggest that labor productivity should be countercyclical due to the law of diminishing returns to factors. Theoretical explanations for this puzzle include exogenous changes in production technology, increasing returns to scale, measurement errors due to unobserved input variations, external economies and composition effects at the aggregate level. Surprisingly, aggregate data for the Chilean industry show that productivity is countercyclical. This paper has two objectives. First, we study the cyclical behavior of productivity in 84 sectors of the Chilean industry in the 1979-1997 period. We find that, contrary to the results obtained using aggregate indexes, disaggregated data confirm that on average productivity is unambiguously procyclical. The main reason for this difference is that aggregate data provides a distorted assessment of the cyclical component of productivity due to the marked heterogeneity of behavior between sectors. Second, we examine the determinants of productivity in the Chilean industry using an econometric model that allow us to quantify the relative contribution of the four different explanations of procyclical productivity. The results indicate that technology shocks account for 50% of productivity cycles in the 1979-1997 period, thus supporting the supply shocks hypothesis as the main source of business cycles in Chile. The other 50% of the productivity shocks is explained by important reallocation effects among sectors of different productivity and, more recently, by the presence of increasing returns. Variations in the utilization of capital and labor effort were insignificant."

Industrial output sacrifice during inflation stabilization and industrial output volatility has frequently been lowered after IT adoption. ITers have consistently reduced inflation forecast errors after IT adoption. The influence of price and output shocks on the behavior of inflation and output gaps has changed much more strongly among ITers than in non-targeting industrial countries in the course of the 1990s. IT has played a role in strengthening the effect of forward-looking expectations on inflation, hence weakening the weight of past inflation inertia. Central bankers’ aversion to inflation is on average not different among ITers in comparison to non-inflation targeters (NITers) but has risen in emerging-country ITers. ITers have gradually reaped a credibility gain, allowing them to achieve their targets with smaller changes in interest rates in the late 1990s than those required in the early 1990s. Chile’s decade-long IT experience toward low stationary inflation shows that gradual phasing in of IT helped in reducing inflation expectations and inflation gradually, and resulted in lower output sacrifice that under a counterfactual more agressive strategy."

Supporting bank re-capitalization and creating incentives for recovering bad loans helped to accelerate the recovery of the banking industry. The total cost was significant. The cost of foreclosure of insolvent institutions was 10.6 % of the GDP and the cost of portfolio purchase under conditions of repurchase reached 6.7 % of the GDP."

 """,2001.,Seasonal cointegration and the stability of the demand for money,"103, Central Bank of Chile.","Studies on money demand in both developed and developing countries coincide in reporting systematic over predictions of monetary aggregates, non-robust estimated parameters and out-of-sample forecast variances that are too large to guide monetary policy. Several explanations have been given for these failures, including dynamic misspecification, omitted variables such as financial innovations, and non observed components. This paper explores an alternative, simpler way to approach the instability of money demand using seasonal-cointegration techniques. Using Chilean data we find that seasonal cointegrating vectors exist and, when omitted from the estimation, account for a substantial fraction of the observed instability in money demand functions. Because seasonal cointegrating vectors act as additional long-run restrictions, they can substantially reduce the variance of forecast errors. The estimated demand for money in Chile is remarkably stable in spite of the profound structural and financial reforms carried out throughout the 1977-2000 period, parameters are robust and similar to those suggested by economic theories."

Policy was opaque in this regime, and has never been studied in the context of rigorous empirical models. Taylor rules, augmented for foreign interest rate influences and interest rate smoothing, and based either on forecast, or actual, inflation and output gap measures, poorly describe the behavior of the discount rate. A satisfactory model includes the deviation of money growth from target in the rule and controls for the extensive financial liberalisation occurring in the period. In practice, the central bank emphasized current inflation, giving a low weight to the output gap.

The estimation procedure shows that the economy moved into a recession density function scenario when the Asian Flu was evident in 1998. Currently, we are in the sustainable rate of growth scenario, without inflationary risks. The analysis reveals that the actual monetary policy is correlated with the indications of the monetary policies proposed by the switching model. The mean growth in the three scenarios is 10%, 6%, and -0.1%, implying a potential non-accelerating inflationary rate of growth of around 6%.

In open economies, stability is best achieved by targeting long-run inflation, a measure of inflation adjusted to remove transitory effects of exchange-rate movements. Stability is also enhanced by adding an exchange-rate term to ""Taylor rules"" for setting interest rates.

Its principal strengths included control of inflation, economic growth, capital formation and savings, while its relative weaknesses were export growth and the unemployment rate.

Subsequently, with parameter values for the U.S., I study the impact of two policies on workers with different on educational levels. One is the elimination of redistribution in the current benefits formula. The second is the change from system defined in benefits (DB) to one defined in contributions (DC). In the first case, results show that redistribution is valued positively by all types of agents, even by those who expect losses from it, given their expected income. As a consequence, workers increase their savings to prepare for the increased uncertainty. The increase in aggregate savings is in the order of 4%. The second case has the opposite consequences. Welfare increases with the adoption of the DC system because it has superior insurance properties. The advantage consists in that periods on which the variance of income is lower receive a higher weight in the calculation of benefits.

The results show that optimal policy reactions change substantially when there is an objective for the CA (besides inflation). Furthermore, once the CA enters the CB objective function, the relative importance of output vis-à-vis inflation variability is less crucial in determining optimal policy rules. Using a simple 2-equation model, the paper then investigates the implications for monetary policy of having an asymmetric objective with respect to the CA. Specifically, it considers the case in which negative deviations from target are considered to be relatively more costly. The results indicate that, in this non-quadratic set-up, monetary policy is clearly more aggressive against positive inflation shocks than in the symmetric case."

Special features of Israel underlying inflation targeting are: a high-inflation history; lack of consensus about the benefits from reducing inflation and thereby lack of full credibility of monetary policy; the existence of monetary policy overburdening in its attempts to meet the inflation targets; the coexistence of an exchange rate band together with the inflation targets. A key finding of the econometric analysis is that there is a time-varying passthrough from exchange rates to prices, which depends on the state of the business cycle and the size of exchange rate fluctuations. In the present empirical specifications, monetary conditions are shown to have played a key role in accounting for the various turning points along the disinflation process. Estimates of an analogue of a 'Taylor rule' indicate that in contrast with the monetary accommodation that prevailed in the past, monetary policy in the more recent years has acted as an inflation stabilizer."

The small open economy model provides unique insights on both fronts. In the case of determinacy issues, the model’s simplicity makes the analysis remarkably transparent. As for long run inflation rates, a small open economy takes as given the foreign nominal interest rate. To the extent that this rate distorts domestic behavior, there is a role for positive domestic nominal rates (in contrast to Friedman’s celebrated optimum quantity of money). This motivation arises naturally in the setting of a small open economy."

These authorities are different in that they have dissimilar preferences with respect to output and inflation gaps and control different policy instruments. Modeled as Nash or Stackelberg equilibria, the solution under lack of policy coordination implies that an increase in the preference divergence between the monetary and fiscal authorities leads to, ceteris paribus, larger public deficits (the fiscal authority's policy instrument) and higher interest rates (the central bank's instrument). The empirical section of the paper tests this conclusion on a pooled sample of 19 industrial countries with annual information for the period 1970-94. Controlling for other shocks and economic conditions, the estimation results support the main conclusion of the theoretical section. The policy implication of the paper is that, without prejudice to the gains from central bank independence, institutional arrangements that allow for coordination both at the level of setting objectives and at the level of policy implementation can alleviate the biases that move the economy to sub-optimally higher fiscal deficits and real interest rates."

 """,2000.,A Note on The Moments of Stochastic Shrinkage Parameters in Ridge Regression,"65, Central Bank of Chile.","A common problem in econometric models and multiple regression in general is multicollinearity, which produces undesirable effects on the Least Squares estimators. A possible solution to this problem is the ""Ridge"" Regression estimator proposed by Hoerl and Kennard (1970). Ridge Regression has been applied to such diverse areas as economics, marketing and the calibration of instruments in industrial processes. However, the properties of these estimators crucially depend upon the selection of certain biasing parameters which are stochastic. In this regard several proposals have been made and the purpose of this paper is to derive general expressions for the moments of the stochastic biasing parameters. With this knowledge we expect to stablish conditions under which a Ridge Regression estimator is better than others."

A tight economic policy, characterized by high interest rates, was implemented in order to contain the private expenditure growth. As a way of reconciling high interest rates with increasing international financial integration, a reserve requirement on capital inflows was applied. The paper shows that private spending responds to the volume of capital inflows, and that these, in turn, respond significantly to the reserve requirement. We obtain that the effect of monetary policy on domestic spending is weakened by capital inflows when the exchange rate is not free to fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates. The reserve requirement can be used to avoid this weakening, by compensating the effects on capital inflows produced by interest rate spreads. The results also show that if the reserve requirement had been eliminated, capital inflows would have grown significantly and the excess domestic demand situation of 1997 would have been aggravated. A more effective strategy for controlling private expenditure would have needed a higher reserve requirement and an even tighter monetary policy, or else a counter-cyclical fiscal policy that would have increased public saving in periods of private expenditure expansion."

We have learned that both income and more permanent characteristics such as education are important determinants of household saving rate. Furthermore, we find an income/expenditure parallelism and positive saving rates for the elderly. At a first stage of analysis, these facts contradict the predictions of the life cycle hypothesis, but some corrections (using demographic characteristics and a different treatment of pensions) change these preliminary conclusions. The differences in the credit constrains by groups are explored in order to study its likely effects on consumption smoothing.

The latter represents the standard loss-function for point inflation targeting. The results show that MP aggressiveness under range targeting critically depends on how hard are the edges of this range. If a range is thought of as a thick point objective, MP is always active (there are no inaction zones), although it is less aggressive against inflation and output shocks if range edges are sufficiently soft (vis-à-vis a point target). Harder edges makes MP more aggressive even when the economy is close to the central part of the range. Finally, an asymmetric loss-function for inflation that penalizes positive deviations relatively more generates a bias against output."

The paper concludes that capital controls have been partially effective by raising the wedge between domestic and foreign interest rates, reducing aggregate net capital inflows, and changing the debt composition toward longer maturities, without significantly altering the real exchange rate. Part of these effects is temporary as the effectiveness of controls is eroded over time for a given interest rates differential. Controls may have been crucial by contributing to Chile’s lower exposure to short-term foreign liabilities at the time of the 1997-98 international financial turmoil. However, achieving temporary macroeconomic benefits by relying on capital controls involves incurring in financial and growth effects that raise concerns about their efficiency.The costs that resulted from the policy mix that comprised the capital controls, in terms of quasi-fiscal losses and lower investment and growth, were probably not negligible."

The empirical strategy involves the estimation of simple equations for GDP growth and conventional inequality measures, augmented to include among the regressors infrastructure quantity and quality indicators in addition to standard controls. To account for the potential endogeneity of infrastructure (as well as that of other regressors), we use a variety of GMM estimators based on both internal and external instruments, and report results using both disaggregated and synthetic measures of infrastructure quantity and quality. The two robust results are: (i) growth is positively affected by the stock of infrastructure assets, and (ii) income inequality declines with higher infrastructure quantity and quality. A variety of specification tests suggest that these results do capture the causal impact of the exogenous component of infrastructure quantity and quality on growth and inequality. These two results combined suggest that infrastructure development can be highly effective to combat poverty. Furthermore, illustrative simulations for Latin American countries suggest that these impacts are economically quite significant, and highlight the growth acceleration and inequality reduction that would result from increased availability and quality of infrastructure."

I consider a model where reserves represent collateral to international borrowing, which is endogenously determined by risk averse foreign investors. This is a departure from usual models of reserve accumulation, that focus solely on the portfolio decision of a central bank along the lines of optimal inventory control models or precautionary saving. In contrast to this view, I find that the expected effect on reserves of changes in the international interest rate or the volatility of the terms of trade is ambiguous if actions are simultaneous. However, if foreign investors and the central bank act sequentially, this ambiguity breaks down. Empirical evidence from OECD and non-OECD economies is suggestive: while LIBOR and terms of trade volatility positively affects the demand for reserves in OECD economies, the effects are reversed in non-OECD countries. This indicates that commitment issues are an important factor in the determination of reserves in non-OECD countries."

Its long inflation history had led to widespread backward-looking indexation in goods, labour, and financial markets as well as in policy instruments. While indexation exacerbates inflation inertia, this paper provides evidence that adoption of inflation targets by an autonomous Central Bank since 1990 has made possible a regime change reflected in gradual inflation convergence toward international levels. Assessing Chile’s targeting experience in an international context and analyzing the conduct of monetary policy in Chile provides the background for understanding its recent stabilization experience. A simple dynamic model illustrates the role and macro effects of inflation targeting in a highly indexed open economy. VAR estimations for inflation, inflation targets, and related macro variables support the notion that the introduction of forward-looking inflation targets has contributed to breaking inflation expectations, paving the way for Chile’s convergence to sustained lower inflation and reducing the influence of indexation albeit most indexation mechanisms are still in place."

If demand for non traded goods has an expenditure elasticity greater than one, and if tradables production is relatively intensive in human capital, then inequality has a non-monotonic effect on the level of the real exchange rate. Empirically, I find a strong relationship in levels between inequality and the bilateral real exchange rate. This partial correlation is large, significant, and positive in the case of within estimation and negative in the case of between estimation. I relate this finding to the expected short and long run effects of inequality on the real exchange rate, and the role factor endowments play in real exchange rate determination. I discuss the relationship of this fact with other strands of the literature, like the determinants of inequality, the effect of inequality on growth and the relevance of Samuelson-Balassa."

The highest levels of IIT have been achieved with geographical neighbours. This seems to support the policy followed by the government, since liberalisation programs have been primarily oriented to neighbouring countries. Chilean IIT can be characterised as vertical, which means that IIT with the rest of the world is mainly of manufactures of different qualities that are classified as the same.

Chile’s present overall tax burden, at about 20 percent of GDP, is in line with that in its neighboring countries. Whether any change from this level is desirable depends in a fundamental way on the public expenditure needs of the country without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability. Chile has a top personal income tax (PIT) rate (45 percent) that is at the high end of the international spectrum, and a corporate income tax (CIT) rate (15 percent) that is an outlier at the low end. The gap between these two rates (the income rate gap) of 30 percentage points could entail important revenue, efficiency, and equity costs that must be weighed carefully against any perceived or actual benefits. It may be worthwhile to undertake an assessment of the revenue and efficiency costs relative to the expected benefits of some aspects of the income tax system. Namely, saving incentives presently available, the cost effectiveness of the global complementary tax in achieving its revenue and equity objectives of taxing income on a global income basis, simpler ways of taxing capital and labor incomes, the introduction of royalties for the exploitation of natural resources. There are also a number of areas where existing policies could be reevaluated to enhance the efficiency and revenue potential of the VAT and excises. They include: (1) the special VAT credit to the construction sector; (2) the present exclusion of the excise revenue on many excisable goods--especially petroleum products--from the VAT base; (3) the role of the stamp duties and the VAT treatment of the financial sector; and (4) the appropriate excise burdens on motor vehicles and petroleum products for revenue and environmental reasons."

The domestic equilibrium represents the real exchange rate response directed at eliminating any excess demand in the goods market; the external equilibrium represents the real exchange rate response directed at maintaining a sustainable current account deficit; meanwhile the financial arbitrage condition represents the response that ensures that the expected return of financial capital is the same in domestic and foreign currency. There is only one real interest rate level and one real exchange rate level compatible with global equilibrium; without international capital mobility, monetary policy is fully autonomous to reach this global equilibrium position. The global equilibrium position can be modified by fiscal policy, particularly allowing the equilibrium to be attained at different levels of the real interest rate. Under full international capital mobility, monetary policy effectiveness is limited and a more flexible fiscal policy, that limits the impact of shocks on the equilibrium interest rate, or a reserve requirement on capital flows, that increases the operational range of monetary policy, is needed to preserve global equilibrium. Without them it will be necessary to take as given the external current account deficit levels that international financial markets are willing to accept, and these level can be extremely volatile, moving from the amplitude and easiness that allows for large expansions in domestic expenditure to the tough restrictions that require severe adjustments."

 """,1998.,"Does Pension Reform Really Spur Productivity, Saving, and Growth?","33, Central Bank of Chile.","Substituting a fully-funded system for a pay-as-you-go regime provides potential efficiency gains in factor markets, can contribute to higher saving, and hence could raise growth. But pension reformers face significant uncertainty about the size and timing of these benefits. This paper sheds light on this issue in two directions. First it reviews recent world-wide empirical and simulations evidence on pension systems and reforms to infer about the likely factor market benefits and potential saving effects of pension reform and their quantitative implications for growth. Then new evidence is provided for Chile, the country with the oldest and most radical pension reform to date. The results suggest that Chile's pension reform has improved labor-market performance and raised saving, investment, and factor productivity, contributing to a quarter of the country's growth increase."

 """,1998.,"Monetary Policy, Interest Rate Rules, and Inflation Targeting: Some Basic Equivalences","32, Central Bank of Chile.","Policymakers increasingly view short-term nominal interest rates as the main instrument of monetary policy, often in conjunction with some inflation target. Interest rates on short-term indexed government debt (i.e., a real interest rate) have also been used as policy instruments. To understand the pros and cons of different policy rules and instruments, this paper derives some basic equivalences among different policy rules. It is shown that , under certain conditions, the following three rules are exactly equivalent: (i) a ""k-percent"" money growth rule; (ii) a nominal interest rate rule combined with an inflation target, and (iii) a real interest rate rule combined with an inflation target. These policy rules, however, become increasingly complex: the first rule requires no feedback mechanism; the second rule requires responding to the inflation gap; while the third rule involves responding to both the inflation gap and the output gap. It is also shown that money growth rules and nominal interest rate rules which respond to the output gap may deliver better outcomes."

The analysis complements previous work done by Ball (1994, 1995), Bonomo and Garcia (1995) and Jadresic (1995, 1996), but with an emphasis on the consequences of the frequency of indexation, and other characteristics of labor contracts, on the sacrifice coefficient. Calvo's (1983) supply equation is extended to include automatic readjustability clauses relating to past inflation, and responses of the economy to various monetary stabilization experiments are simulated. The results suggest that indexation introduces inertia in the inflationary process and therefore increases the sacrifice coefficient. Interestingly, the relation between the frequency of indexation and the cost of stabilization is not monotonic. A greater indexation frequency can reduce de sacrifice coefficient. The examples studied suggest that with biannual wage contracts, the typical structure observed in Chile, the sacrifice coefficient is maximized with six-month readjustment frequency, the typical frequency observed in Chile."

During recent years, however, many less developed economies that have implemented relatively successful stabilization plans, have included as part of the reform package wage nominalization and/or the use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. On the other hand, indexation of financial instruments, a practice that used to be the result of high inflation periods, has become a fashionable practice in more developed economies. This survey examines theoretical and empirical literature on three different types of indexation: wage, financial and exchange rate indexation. In contrast to other survey articles, our revision unifies the analysis of indexation in these three markets. First, we analyze the origin of each type of indexation, as well as their effects on the particular market where it is being applied, and on the economy as a whole. Second, we analyze the effect of each type of indexation on the inflation process, the economic authority's willingness to disinflate, and the costs of disinflating."

 """,1998.,The Chilean Experience Regarding Completing Markets with Financial Indexation,"29, Central Bank of Chile.","The general hypothesis that financial indexation to the CPI has been important for the development of the Chilean capital markets is analyzed from several perspectives. The effective maturity shortening of nominal bonds, the likely dollarization of longer term debt and the reduction of average maturities, imply smaller markets or higher expected bankruptcy costs as a direct consequence of not having indexation in countries with moderately high and variable inflation rates. The Chilean market appears as a successful example of financial indexation, with a very large percentage of indexed assets held by investors (between 63 % and 99% - excluding banks and equity investment in the latter measure). The development of an indexed fixed-income market has indirectly impacted the development of others, including the equity market. The distortion in relative returns to debt and equity has also contributed to the development of these markets. Short- and long-term indexed bonds provide distinct, unique and relevant patterns of returns that cannot be replicated in the international markets. This uniqueness is relevant since unexpected indexed bond returns represent ""changes in state variables"" that significantly impact asset prices, and also since diverse economic sectors would find different ""optimal"" debt structures (or hedge portfolios), in terms of their relative currency denomination (UF-USD) and maturity. We also find evidence that: i) the Central Bank of Chile's asset composition should include and a small proportion of long-term US government debt and also emerging market equity; ii) it makes little sense for local investors to invest in foreign fixed income as a long-term strategy."

It is argued that important practical problems in implementing indexation are solved by creating such indexed units of account. The author advocates creating such units in other countries, even countries with relatively low rates of inflation such as the United States, and argues that an alternative definition of the units, relating the units to measures of income, may also be advantageous. Ideally, such indexed units of account might someday be ""monetized,"" i.e., institutions such as debit cards may be devised to allow the units to be used for all transactions, so that the role of conventional money might be reduced to clearing-house functions only."

 """,1998.,Optimal Management of Indexed and Nominal Debt,"26, Central Bank of Chile.","A tax-smoothing objective is used to assess the optimal composition of public debt with respect to maturity and contingencies. This objective motivates the government to make its debt payouts contingent on the levels of public outlay and the tax base. If these contingencies are present, but asset prices of non-contingent indexed debt are stochastic, then full tax smoothing dictates an optimal maturity structure of the noncontingent debt. If the certainty-equivalent outlays are the same for each period, then the government should guarantee equal real payouts in each period, that is, the debt takes the form of indexed consols. This structure insulates the government's budget constrain from unpredictable variations in the market prices of indexed bonds of various maturities. If contingent debt is precluded, then the government may want to depart from a consol maturity structure to exploit covariances among public outlay, the tax base, and the term structure of real interest rates. However, if moral hazard is the reason for the preclusion of contingent debt, then this consideration also deters exploitation of these covariances and tends to return the optimal solution to the consol maturity structure. The issue of nominal bonds may allow the government to exploit the covariances among public outlay, the tax base, and the rate of inflation. But if moral-hazard explains the absence of contingent debt, then the same reasoning tends to make nominal debt issue undesirable. The bottom line is that an optimal-tax. approach to public debt favors bonds that are indexed and long term."

Although the contributions of each factor to growth have changed during these 37 years, on average, 1,6% of growth is explained by capital and 3,9% by labor. The contribution of trade is only significative in the eighties, consisting of approximately 1,5 percentage points for the 1986-96 period. The potential growth rate has been 6,5% during the nineties, increasing from 6,0% in 1990 to 7,0% in 1996. Hence, the economy has evolved around the productive frontier.

Then we compare this measures with alternative measures of country risk and exchange risk plus expected devaluation.

The most important conclusions are that wage indexation does not automatically appear with an inflation boom-1 that periods of wage or exchange rate indexation present grater inflationary levels, volatility and persistence; and that nominalization experiences have happened due to the necessity to cut real wages to support competitiveness or due to unemployment, and/or the necessity to limit inflationary inertia as part of a stabilization plan."

Volatility is undesirable in an indexed economy that attempts do disinflate, making the smoothing of the business cycle an issue for economic policy. The article studies the effect of public expenditure stabilization and the use of taxes as an counter cyclical tool. This is done calibrating a basic macroeconomic model to Chilean reality. The results show that about 25% of variability in growth rates could be eliminated in the model if cyclical fiscal impulses where avoided. This could be achieved with constant rates of growth for public consumption and investment, and through counter cyclical taxes. Finally, the article proposes the idea of establishing a stabilization mechanism for public expenditure through growth limits and state dependent flexibility rules. The establishment of a stabilization fund for tax revenues where counter cyclical responses by the fiscal sector could be accounted for and accumulated, is important for expenditure growth stabilization to be effective and credible. This measure could grant public expenditure independence from changes in tax collecting along the business cycle. Moreover, the possibility of flexibilizing the VAT is analyzed, assessing its effectiveness, its time consistency problems, and the costs and benefits of substituting it with some degree of flexibility on income taxes or on investment tax incentives. The article concludes that there exists a series of fiscal instruments that could be used in a counter cyclical way, like expenditure growth rules, stabilization funds and flexible tax systems."

An Overlapping Generations Model with heterogeneous agents is used. Heterogeneity is introduced by means of different abilities among individuals and non negative bequest motives. A key feature of the model is the explicit introduction of a government and its fiscal policy. The model is then used to investigate the empirical implications of different social security regimes and redistributional policies undertaken by the government on income distribution, growth, and capital accumulation. The theoretical model is calibrated in order to match some key stylized facts of Brazil and USA. The paper shows that under certain redistributional policies undertaken by the government, a pay-as-you-go system leads to more income inequality and a worse economic perfomance than a fully funded system. Another important implication of the paper is that the contradictory evidence regarding the Kuznets curve found in the empirical literature can be explained by the simultaneous relation between income distribution and level of income (one is not exogenous to the other). The relationship builds upon complex interactions between fiscal policy and the distribution of abilities of the population. Thus, the paper concludes that the Kuznets curve can have any arbitrary shape at a theoretical level, and the inverted U shape is only compatible with a particular realization of fiscal policies."

 """,1997.,Investment under Uncertainty and Financial Market Development: A q-Theory Approach,"17, Central Bank of Chile.","The paper presents a theoretical model of investment under uncertainty, incorporating the financial sector development as a key factor for determining the effect and level of uncertainty. As a difference with previous works, the model is developed using a Tobin's q approach, analyzing the effects from an equilibrium perspective -comparative static-. The model assumes partial reversibility in investment decisions and a representative firm participating in a non-competitive market. Uncertainty is associated to the market conditions faced by the firm in the commercialization of the products or services that offers. From the model we conclude that uncertainty affects negatively the capital accumulation process. Assuming an initial equilibrium condition, as uncertainty increases, a higher expected growth on market conditions will be required in order to remain in an equilibrium state. If the requirement is not satisfied, as should occur in the short run, q decreases and, as a consequence, the stock of capital. The dynamic on q makes the firm gradually converge to a pseudo equilibrium point, where it stays while there is no change in uncertainty about market conditions, increase in the expected growth of market conditions is not verified or the financial market does not become more developed. Financial market deepness has important effects on economic agents ability to diversify risk, accuracy in firms' valuation and economic volatility. Then, a more developed financial market conducts the economy to an improved environment; less uncertainty is perceived by investors and its effect over decision making is reduced. As a result, investment increases, strengthening the economic growth capacity."

We use Semi-NonParametric estimation techniques that show that the bivariate process between real money holdings and inflation has important departures from gaussianity and homogeneity. This feature provides insights regarding the effects of unanticipated innovations of inflation and real money holdings on their trajectory in time. Non linear impulse response analysis highlights the presence of asymmetries that would not be detected by traditional VAR models. Finally, parametric and non parametric techniques are used to evaluate the hypothesis of a stable long run relation between inflation and real money holdings.

Consumption theory brings out a number of direct channels through which income inequality can affect overall household saving -- positively in most cases. However, recent political-economy theory points toward indirect, negative effects of inequality -- through investment, growth, and public saving -- on aggregate saving. On theoretical grounds the sign of the saving-inequality link is therefore ambiguous. This paper presents new empirical evidence on the relationship between income distribution and aggregate saving, based on a new and improved income distribution database for both industrial and developing countries. The empirical results, using alternative inequality and saving measures and various econometric specifications on both cross-section and panel data, provide no support for the notion that income inequality has any systematic effect on aggregate saving. These findings are consistent with the theoretical ambiguity but contrast with previous empirical literature that found a positive cross-country association between income inequality and aggregate saving."

The basic intuition is that if investors require liquidity and they do not find it in one country, then they will seek fims in a second country.

Any developing economy can benefit from financial development, but international financial integration implies the risk of macroeconomic instability. The approach that has been favored in Chile and Colombia is one of gradual and limited financial integration, attempting to increase the effectiveness of monetary and exchange rate policies. The reduction in the risk premiurn demanded by investors has created downward pressure on domestic real interest rates, however a lower interest rate would increase domestic expenditure, the price level and the current account deficit. Among the policies put into effect to deal with this problem are increasing exchange rate flexibility and taxing external financing. Both countries have registered a successful macroeconomic performance, with the success partly owing to effective capital account regulation. The effectiveness of the regulations is shown in that a once and for all currency appreciation followed by a depreciating trend has been avoided, and that the current account deficit has been kept at sustainable levels. In other words, capital account regulations have avoided the overshooting (over appreciation) of the real exchange rate that would have occurred with large amounts of short term capital inflows. Using stronger restrictions on capital flows, quantitative limits for example, would not only create very significant microeconomic costs and slow economic and financial developments, but also most likely would be ineffective."

Yes, as shown by the simulations for a representative economy reported in this paper, based on the stady-state solution of a twosector two-period overlapping-generations model. A PAYG system can raise long-term saving, income, and welfare in a two-sector economy if the formal sector (forced to pay mandatory PAYG taxes) is more capital intensive than the non-taxed informal sector, causing higher wages and lower interest rates.
