 """,2023.,"Housing quality improvement, property market dynamics, and sustainable house prices","DP2023/01, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","This paper reviews the literature that examines the circumstances when house prices are likely to become unsustainable. It argues that there are 2 types of unsustainability: - The first type happens when there is a widespread increase in demand for better quality housing, or a rapid increase in population, which leads to a construction boom. Since the number of new houses typically built by the construction sector is much smaller than the stock of houses, the boom may run up against capacity constraints for several years during which time prices rise and then fall back to normal levels. This type of boom could be managed by a central bank but there would be other trade-offs to consider. - The second type of price unsustainability happens when there are technical or regulatory changes that reduce the usual cost of producing new houses. This type of unsustainability reflects supply factors and is typically outside the domain of the central bank. - The paper argues that the demand for better quality housing (which cannot be quickly met from new supply) is a major reason for unsustainable house prices, and a reason why house price cycles are often so different from price cycles in other industries."

 """,2022.,What Matters for Job Finding and Separation in the long-run?,"DP2022/02, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","This Discussion Paper analyses job finding rates and job separation rates in New Zealand. We find that individual characteristics, including age, gender, ethnicity and education have a significant impact on job finding and separation rates, even after controlling for other factors. Further, we find that higher separation rates of young workers play a large role in explaining differences in employment outcomes across age groups, while differences in finding rates are more important in explaining differences by education level. Both finding and separation rate differences are important in explaining differences across ethnicities. The results underscore the importance of well-targeted labour market support policies."

 """,2022.,A monthly financial conditions index for New Zealand,"DP2022/01, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","Financial conditions refer to the state of financial variables such as interest rates, share prices, house prices and exchange rates. If financial conditions in the economy are ‘loose’, they stimulate real economic activity, and if they are ‘tight’, economic activity is constrained. The implications of financial conditions for macroeconomic outcomes has motivated the development of financial conditions indices (FCIs) that summarise common movements in financial and macroeconomic data. In general, an FCI offers a gauge of how shifts in central bank policy and economic outlooks, including foreign financial condition shocks, are filtering out into the real world. A timely FCI would help the policy-maker assess, almost in real time, whether financial conditions in the economy are loose or tight. However, the development of a timely FCI is not a straightforward task because the data used to estimate it may be available at different frequencies – semi-annual or quarterly or weekly or daily intervals - and are also often incomplete. Financial data are available at ‘high frequencies’, that is, sometimes even at a daily or hourly frequency, but may be hampered by missing values. On the other hand, macroeconomic time series such as Gross Domestic Product, GDP, or household consumption are only available at quarterly frequencies. In this paper, Miguel Herculano constructs a monthly FCI for New Zealand, using novel estimation techniques that resolve problems posed by missing data, and also enable the use of data that are available at different time frequencies. Since the new FCI is timelier than other alternatives that are available only at a quarterly frequency, it makes it more appealing to policymakers. The new FCI summarises information from 73 relevant financial and macroeconomic variables that are available at either monthly or quarterly frequencies. Interest rate spreads and mortgage lending are found to be the most relevant contributors to the dynamics of the monthly FCI. Estimates suggest that changes in the FCI have exerted relatively stronger influences on the New Zealand business cycle in more recent years. The predictive content of the financial conditions index for forecasting GDP and unemployment is not explored in the current version of the paper and is left for future research. About the research programme The Reserve Bank carries out a wide range of research related to monetary policy. This research programme may or may not change our overall view of monetary policy- whether rates should be raised or cut and by how much. The Reserve Bank’s overarching aim is to promote the prosperity and well-being of all New Zealanders. With monetary policy, our core focus is to support full employment and low and stable inflation. Monetary policy remains an effective, but blunt, tool to achieve these goals"

 """,2021.,Star Wars at Central Banks,"DP2021/01, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","Researchers in economics often write stars (*) next to their results, to highlight which results pass conventional thresholds of certainty, or ‘statistical significance’. Researchers typically like showing starry results because they can improve perceptions about the value of a piece of work, broadening its influence. But are these stars always what they seem? In our paper we investigate whether researchers use improper methods to produce more starry results, something that we worry would foster exaggeration. For example, researchers often have to decide whether to delete suspicious-looking data points. Each deletion can change results, and the right choice is often subjective. So researchers have freedom to shape their results somewhat. If researchers use that freedom to favour starry results, their work will suffer from exaggeration. Others have also investigated this problem, focusing mostly on research published in academic journals. Their findings do suggest exaggeration and now there is growing support for lifting research standards. Still, our work is important because it is unclear whether the findings about journals apply to central banks. To investigate, we compile 2 decades of research results from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. We then use 2 popular methods to detect exaggeration in the dataset. Both build on the observation that researchers start assigning stars at a human-made threshold of significance, whereas nature, which should dictate the true pattern of results, is indifferent to that threshold. So if the observed pattern of results shows anomalies at the starry threshold, we can be confident that the anomalies come from researchers. Most complex is the final step: figuring out whether the anomalies come from exaggeration or something else. Our findings are mixed. The first method shows no evidence of exaggeration but often misses exaggeration when it occurs. The second method shows some evidence of exaggeration but relies on strong assumptions. We test those assumptions and challenge their merit. At this point, all that is clear is that central banks produce results with patterns different from those in journals, there being less bunching at the starry threshold (see the figure below). The source of this difference remains a mystery."

Our results say yes! We contribute to the emerging literature on forecasting macroeconomic variables using machine-learning algorithms by testing the ‘nowcast’ performance of common algorithms in a full ‘real time’ setting. That is, with real-time vintages of New Zealand GDP growth (our target variable) and real-time vintages of around 600 predictors. Our results show machine-learning algorithms are able to significantly improve over standard models used in economics to nowcast macroeconomic variables. We also show machine-learning algorithms have the potential to improve the official forecasts of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand."

 """,2019.,"Understanding labour market developments in New Zealand, 1986-2017","DP2019/02, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","In this paper we document longer-term trends in the New Zealand labour market using unit-record data from the Household Labour Force Survey (HLFS) and HLFS-Income Supplement. We focus on analysing the factors behind the large increases in labour force participation over 1986-2017, as well as on decomposing wage growth into contributions from continuing workers versus compositional effects associated with flows into and out of employment. New Zealand’s aggregate labour force participation rate has steadily trended up since 1993, despite an aging population. The dampening effect from population aging has been more than offset by increasing participation among older workers, with the participation rate of those aged 55 and over increasing from around 20 percent to 50 percent. We find that increased participation among prime-age females also contributed significantly to the increase in aggregate labour force participation. Further, rising levels of education over time are estimated to have boosted participation across demographics. Inflation adjusted wages grew by about 1.5 percent annually on average over the period from 1997 to 2015. Net employment growth over the period has tended to restrict average wage growth. Average wage growth has been lower since 2008 than before, suggesting weaker economy-wide wage pressure. This is mainly due to lower wage growth among continuing workers rather than compositional changes in employment, perhaps due to firms cutting costs and loss of worker bargaining power."

 """,2019.,Household Leverage and Asymmetric Housing Wealth Effects- Evidence from New Zealand,"DP2019/01, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008/09 highlighted the impact that household debt and leverage have on consumption, above and beyond the important role of wealth emphasized by classical theories of consumer behaviour (Fisher, 1930; Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954; Friedman, 1957). In this paper, we study the role of household indebtedness in transmitting housing wealth shocks to consumption empirically. Housing wealth and mortgage leverage take center stage of the recent literature on consumption partly because housing wealth accounts for the lion’s share of household wealth in most advanced economies and partly because of the prominent role played by house price dynamics and mortgage debt accumulation in the years preceding the Great Recession. We use microdata from New Zealand Household Economic Survey (HES) to study the housing wealth effect on consumption while controlling for household leverage. House price dynamics in New Zealand represent an interesting contrast to the US: While the US economy experienced a severe housing market downturn after the GFC, house prices and household leverage in New Zealand have been persistently rising over the last decade. Empirical studies focusing on this period for the US show that household leverage amplified the housing wealth effect on consumption through the collateral channel (Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997 and Iacoviello, 2005). Our main empirical finding is that, on average, the elasticity of the consumption growth to housing price changes is 0.22%. This corresponds to 3 cents out of one dollar in terms of marginal propensity of consume out of housing wealth. In addition, we find that the housing wealth effect is asymmetric with respect to positive and negative housing wealth shocks. The housing wealth elasticity is 0.23 for negative shocks, as compared to 0.13 in response to positive changes in housing wealth. We contribute the asymmetric housing wealth effect to the influence of household indebtedness. The intuition of the finding is that leveraged gains might mostly be used to pay down debt (precautionary saving effect), whereas leveraged losses have a more direct bearing on consumption (collateral effect). This finding is based on further investigating the role played by household indebtedness in accounting for the asymmetric housing wealth effect. First, we find that, on average, measures of indebtedness negatively impact on the consumption growth. When we separate positive and negative housing wealth shocks, we find evidence showing that the collateral effect is significant only with negative shocks, while the precautionary saving effect is significant only with positive housing wealth shocks. This empirical finding implies that the precautionary savings effect and the collateral effect work in the different phases of housing cycles. In a housing boom the precautionary savings motive dominates and high leverage weakens the reaction of consumption spending to housing wealth increases. In a housing downturn the collateral channel dominates and high leverage strengthens the reaction of consumption to housing wealth decreases. In another words, the household leverage reinforces the housing wealth effect in a bust, but dampens the housing wealth effect in a boom. The asymmetric transmission mechanism through household indebtedness explains the asymmetric housing wealth effect that we find in the data without controlling leverage explicitly."

 """,2018.,Deviations in real exchange rate levels in the OECD countries and their structural determinants,"DP2018/08, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","The most commonly used theoretical framework describing why prices in some countries are higher than in others (i.e. explaining deviations from purchasing power parity) is the Balassa-Samuelson model. The Balassa-Samuelson model implies that stronger productivity growth should tend to cause a country's real exchange rate to appreciate. This paper develops measures of productivity and real exchange rate levels across industries and countries to allow the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis to be tested. We show that the model finds empirical support in 17 OECD economies: there is a link between real exchanges and sectoral productivity levels both across countries and over time. We then show theoretically and empirically that relaxing the model's assumptions about wage determination and the role of labour market differences across sectors and countries helps improve the performance of the model. However, there remains large unexplained deviations in real exchange rates across countries that the model cannot account for."

 """,2018.,Migration and Business Cycle Dynamics,"DP2018/07, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","We examine the business cycle effects that arise from an expansion of the population due to migration. We identify the contribution that migration shocks make to cyclical fluctuations, and illustrate their dynamic impact. The analysis presented here is conducted in per capita terms. We develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to explore the consequences of migration. Households consume foreign- and domestically-produced goods, and housing. Domestically-produced goods are produced using effective labour and physical capital, where effective labour is a composite of physical labour and human capital. The level of human capital is particularly important for the dynamics of the migration shock as it amplifies the labour supply impact of a migration impulse. The model also embodies other frictions. Physical capital, for example, has a variable utilisation rate and adjusting the stock of capital is costly. Variable utilisation and capital adjustment costs are important for the dynamics of shocks. Variable utilisation provides an extra margin of adjustment in response to a shock, while capital adjustment costs serve to slow the propagation of shocks to investment. The model has three stocks of capital: physical capital; housing; and human capital. A migration inflow erodes the per capita stock of physical and housing capital, but the effect on the stock of human capital is ambiguous because migrants may have more or less human capital than domestic residents. The stock of migrant human capital relative to local resident human capital has a material impact on the dynamics of the migration impulse and on the contribution that migrant shocks make to business cycle fluctuations. Using the estimated DSGE model, we show that migration shocks account for a considerable portion of the variability of per capita gross domestic product (GDP). While migration shocks matter for the capital investment and consumption components of per capita GDP, there are other drivers of cyclical fluctuations in these expenditure components that are even more important. Migration shocks also matter for residential investment and real house prices, but once again other shocks play a larger role in driving volatility. In the DSGE model, the level of human capital possessed by migrants relative to that of locals materially affects the business cycle impact of migration. The impact of migration shocks is larger when migrants have substantially different – larger or smaller – levels of human capital relative to locals. When the average migrant has higher levels of human capital than locals, as seems to be common in most OECD economies, a migration shock has an expansionary effect on per capita GDP and its components, which also accords with the evidence from a restricted structural vector autoregression."

 """,2018.,Housing Leverage and Consumption Expenditure - Evidence from New Zealand Microdata,"DP2018/06, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","Understanding household consumption spending is crucial for modelling business cycles and designing macroeconomic policy. This paper investigates how household debt affects the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth. We use microdata from Statistics New Zealand’s ""Household Economic Survey"" (HES) to investigate how household leverage affects the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of housing wealth. HES data provide detailed information on household spending, income and loans. Empirically, estimating the effect of housing wealth changes on household expenditure faces two types of endogeneity issues. First, any evidence of an association between housing wealth variations and consumption changes could be driven by unobservable confounding factors such as future income expectations or household preferences. Second, naive regressions with total household spending can suffer from reversed causality, in which high housing-related spending leads to higher property values. We combine HES data with Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) micro house price data to address the endogeneity issues that arise from using household-level cross-sectional data. In the empirical analysis, we first assess the validity of average local house prices as an instrument for individual house prices. The first stage regression suggests that the instrument can explain up to 22 percent of the variation in individual house prices reported in HES. We then run a benchmark regression of total household expenditure excluding housing-related spending on housing wealth. The IV estimation suggests that using household-level prices leads to downward bias, which is the result of various causes of endogeneity issues discussed above. The average MPC out of a one-dollar increase in exogenous housing wealth is around 2.2 cents. All regressions control for income, household characteristics, and regional and time fixed effects. We also split non-housing expenditure into durables and non-durables. In line with other studies in the literature, we find that durable consumption is more sensitive to changes in housing wealth than non-durables. We then focus on the role of household leverage in determining the MPC out of housing wealth. In this analysis, we study how leverage measures, such as the loan-to-house-value ratio (LVR) and the DTI, affect the estimated MPC out of housing wealth. Overall, we find that household leverage weakens the MPC associated with housing. To examine the robustness of these findings, we investigate whether household spending responds differently depending on the age and type 5 of home ownership. The findings confirm that the consumption of mortgagors is less sensitive to housing wealth as compared to outright homeowners. The regression with an age-housing wealth interaction also shows that the response of younger households to changes in their housing wealth is weaker than the response of older households, which tend to be less leveraged."

 """,2018.,Loan-to-Value Ratio Restrictions and House Prices,"DP2018/05, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","This paper contributes to the international policy debate on the effect of macroprudential policy on housing-market dynamics. We use detailed New Zealand housing market data to evaluate the effect of loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions on house prices. The main challenge in identifying these effects is that housing markets are affected by a range factors over and above LVR policy. For example, New Zealand experienced a raft of policy changes and macroeconomic shocks during the periods in which LVR policy changes were implemented. Many of these shocks and policies are likely to have affected the housing market. For example, when the first LVR policy was implemented, retail interest rates were rising alongside an increasing expectation for monetary policy tightening, while the New Zealand Treasury was adjusting housing-related policies at the time of the second LVR policy. This paper uses the exemption for new builds from the LVR restrictions as a natural experiment to identify the effect of LVR policy. We find that, over the one year window around the new home exemption, the first LVR policy (referred to as ‘LVR 1’) had a 3 percent moderating effect on house prices, and this moderating effect is broadly similar across both Auckland and the rest of New Zealand. Interestingly, our estimates show that LVR 2 (which tightened restrictions on Auckland properties and loosened restrictions elsewhere) did not significantly stop Auckland house prices from rising. By contrast, house prices in the rest of New Zealand (RONZ) increased by 3 percent due to the relative loosening of the LVR restriction. In LVR 3, the RBNZ further tightened the LVR restrictions on property investors nationwide. The moderating effect of LVR 3 was clearly seen in Auckland with a 2.7 percent reduction in house prices. This LVR 3 effect is both statistically and economically significant, as during the same period the average house price increased by 5.8 percent. Overall, we estimate that the LVR policies reduced house price pressures by almost 50 percent. However, the effect of LVR policy is highly non-linear. When it becomes binding, LVR policy can be very effective in curbing housing prices."

 """,2018.,Real-time forecasting with macro-finance models in the presence of a zero lower bound,"DP2018/04, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","We investigate the real-time forecasting performance of macro-finance vector auto-regression models, which incorporate macroeconomic data and yield curve component estimates as would have been available at the time of each forecast, for the United States. Our results show a clear benefit from using yield curve information when forecasting macroeconomic variables, both prior to the Global Financial Crisis and continuing into the period where the lower-bound constrained shorter-maturity interest rates. The forecasting gains, relative to traditional macroeconomic models, for inflation and the Federal Funds Rate are generally statistically significant and economically material for the horizons up to the four years that we tested. However, macro-finance models do not improve the real-time forecasts over shorter horizons for capacity utilisation, our variable representing real economic activity. This is in contrast to the related recent macro-finance literature, which establishes such results (as do we) with pseudo real-time, i.e. truncated final-vintage, data. Nevertheless, for longer horizons that are more relevant for central bankers, yield curve information does improve activity forecasts. Overall, our results suggest that the yield curve contains fundamental information about the likely evolution of the macroeconomy. We find less convincing evidence for the reverse direction, which is likely because expectations of macroeconomic variables are already reflected in the yield curve. However, for longer horizons, we find there are still some gains from using macroeconomic variables to forecast the yield curve."

 """,2018.,Optimal grid selection in numerical approaches to dynamic heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models,"DP2018/03, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","A well-known fact about household savings behaviour is that it depends on an individual's own wealth holdings and income expectations. In understanding how these decisions aggregate and respond to policy, we must therefore confront the substantial heterogeneity in these features which is present in the macro economy. One persistent challenge in the literature which aims to provide this understanding is the need to keep track of and forecast the decisions of every single individual in the economy. Such a feat is not possible in practice, so that some grouping of individuals is typically needed to sidestep the issue. This article considers the dividing of households into representative groups to optimally represent savings decisions across the wealth distribution. Such a division is guided by the principle that many groups are needed where there is a large amount of variation in savings propensities. Combining numerical analysis with theory on consumption behaviour, it is shown in the context of a simple model that the savings behaviour of wealthy and poor households can be captured by including a single representative for each category. Meanwhile, several groups are needed to describe the behaviour of the middle class. Middle class households face uncertain future income comparable in size to current wealth holdings, leading to a wide range of savings propensities when compared to poor hand-to-mouth individuals and wealthy savers."

 """,2018.,Residential construction and population growth in New Zealand: 1996-2016,"DP2018/02, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","This paper aims to understand how population growth has affected building activity in New Zealand regions during the last twenty years. Using panel data regression techniques, we estimate that 0.25 – 0.30 additional houses are built for every additional person in a region. The additional 0.25 – 0.30 building permits per person equate to about 40 m2 of new construction, with a value of just over $60,000 in 2016 terms. This construction is in addition to the ‘background’ construction that occurs to replace old houses, which amounts to 2.5 – 3.0 dwellings per 1,000 people per year, or approximately 11,000 – 13,000 dwellings per year. The estimates suggest Auckland’s construction shortfall between 1996 and 2016 was between 40,000 and 55,000 dwellings, or approximately 10 percent of Auckland’s housing stock. The estimates of the shortfall are fairly robust to changes in the specification of the models; moreover, they all suggest that the shortfall was modest until the end of 2005, when it increased rapidly. We also examine the relationship between the size of newly constructed dwellings and population change. Since four of the sixteen New Zealand regions experienced almost no population growth over the period, it is possible to contrast the size of newly constructed houses in regions experiencing population change with those that did not. These estimates suggest that, at least until 2005, smaller houses were constructed in growing regions with above-average incomes, particularly Auckland and Wellington, than in growing regions with below average incomes or in regions with no population growth. This difference appears to reflect the much younger age profile of the residents of Auckland and Wellington. It appears that Auckland’s housing shortfall was less severe prior to 2005 precisely because of the large number of small apartments that were constructed in the city. Not until apartment construction almost completely ceased in 2008 did Auckland’s housing shortage started to become acute. Finally, we analyse the relationship between population growth rates and the number of ‘residential’ construction workers. Our estimates suggest that a 1 percent increase in population growth rates is associated with a 0.4 – 0.5 percentage point increase in the fraction of the workforce in the construction sector. Since regions with zero population growth have 4.5 – 5 percent of their workers involved in residential construction, each percentage increase in the population growth rate increases the number of residential construction workers by approximately 10 percent. This does not include additional workers in related industries such as building materials. Auckland is again an outlier. For most of the period Auckland had approximately 9000 fewer construction workers than could be expected from trends around the rest of the country. Clearly, if this shortfall continues it will be difficult for Auckland to overcome its housing shortage."

 """,2018.,Global Factors and Trend Inflation,"DP2018/01, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","Many studies have shown that domestic inflation in different countries tends to behave similarly. One possible explanation for this observation is that domestic inflation dynamics are in part determined by global factors. This implies that central banks need to account for global factors when explaining and predicting inflation. Their importance however depends on whether they have long lasting effects on domestic inflation rates. Using a large macroeconomic dataset, we propose a methodology to decompose inflation into its permanent (trend) and transitory (gap) components. We then quantify the role of domestic and global factors in determining each of these components. We first apply the model to a sample of economies with long-standing inflation targeting regimes. We then extend our analysis to a sample of ten Asian economies to draw comparisons. In our first sample, we find that global factors have a sizeable influence on inflation behaviour. However, this is mainly temporary and appears to reflect movements in commodity prices. The effect of global factors on trend inflation is small. In our second sample, a set of countries with more diverse monetary policy regimes, we find global factors have a much larger role. A possible explanation is that inflation targeting may have reduced the influence of global factors on trend inflation."

 """,2017.,Macroprudential policies in a low interest-rate environment,"DP2017/04, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, a new set of challenges has emerged for macroeconomic policy makers. One of the major changes in the post-crisis environment is a significant and permanent decline in interest rates. In many economies, the short-term nominal interest rate has been close to zero. Monetary policymakers have encountered difficulties in stimulating the economy because the interest rate cannot be lowered any further. Moreover, when interest rates are persistently low, agents tend to engage in speculative investment in assets, such as real estate. Therefore, low interest rates may also contribute to asset price bubbles and excessive leverage, which pose risks to financial stability. One of the policies that has become important after the crisis is the so-called macroprudential policy, aimed at ensuring a more stable financial system. In this paper, we focus on the use of macroprudential policies in an economic environment in which interest rates are low. We argue that, in a low interest-rate environment, the case for using macroprudential policies becomes even stronger. On the one hand, greater financial volatility due to low interest rates calls for macroprudential policies to contain excessive bank lending. On the other hand, macroprudential policy may also complement monetary policy when the interest rate is close to zero and cannot be used to stabilise the economy anymore. We build an economic model for policy evaluation that can take into account that nominal interest rates are subject to a zero lower bound and cannot become negative. We calibrate the model to characteristics of the US economy where the Federal funds rate has been close to zero for 7 years. Within this setting, we find that when the interest rate is persistently low, activity in the financial markets and the wider economy, becomes more volatile. Therefore, we propose macroprudential policy as a candidate to stabilise the economy in this context. On the one hand, we find that in a low interest-rate environment, tighter macroprudential policies can stabilise financial markets. We also find, on the other hand, that macroprudential policies could help monetary policy stimulate the economy when interest rates are close to zero."

A common definition of an asset price bubble is the existence of explosive dynamics. This paper tests for periods of explosiveness in the New Zealand dollar measured at a monthly and quarterly frequency. To determine whether, during any explosive changes, the exchange rate was disconnected from changes in relative economic fundamentals, these tests are also applied to three models of exchange rate determination. This paper finds no evidence of episodes when either the New Zealand dollar or its fundamentals were explosive."

The results suggest that bouts of explosiveness in exchange rates are uncommon at a daily frequency. However, periods of explosiveness tend to last for several days. Such episodes only involve small changes in actual currency levels, which usually reverse shortly after. This paper identifies the currency in a currency pair that is experiencing explosive dynamics by also considering the dynamics of effective exchange rates of different currencies. There is high concordance with explosiveness in the broad value of the US dollar exchange rate, suggesting that there are relatively few instances where explosiveness in individual cross- rates reflected country-specific factors."

These antithetical attributes are related to the autoregressive coefficient estimates implying a very high signal-to-noise ratio in terms of the variance of trend shocks as a fraction of the overall quarterly forecast error variance. When we impose a lower signal-to-noise ratio, the resulting BN decomposition, which we label the ""BN filter"", produces a more intuitive estimate of the output gap that is large in amplitude, highly persistent, and typically increases in expansions and decreases in recessions. Real-time estimates from the BN filter are also reliable in the sense that they are subject to smaller revisions and predict future output growth and inflation better than estimates from other methods of trend-cycle decomposition that also impose a low signal-to-noise ratio, including deterministic detrending, the Hodrick-Prescott filter, and the bandpass filter."

 """,2016.,"Bond premia, monetary policy and exchange rate dynamics","DP2016/11, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","I propose a model in which uncertainty about the value of ex-post payoffs drives a wedge - a short-term bond premium - between an observed short-term benchmark interest rate and the unobserved discount rate, that is used to allocate consumption over time. The model helps to explain disconnect between exchange rates and interest rate fundamentals; disconnect between measures of risk that price bonds and measures of risk that price currencies; and why exchange rates are ""too smooth"" relative to the volatile discount rates implied by equity premia. In the model with risk, the exchange rate response to monetary policy is observationally similar, whether monetary policy moves the discount rate or the bond market premium. Between policy changes, interest rate stabilisation (i) isolates the currency from variation in the discount rate; and (ii) shifts the expression of bond risk from bond yields to the currency premium.

We provide two examples in which the candidate forecasts comfortably outperform those from benchmark specifications by conventional statistical metrics such as root mean squared prediction errors and average logarithmic scores. Our assessment of economic significance uses an explicit loss function that relates economic value to a forecast communication problem for an inflation targeting central bank. We analyse the Bank of England's forecasts for inflation during the period in which the central bank operated within a strict inflation targeting framework in our first example. In our second example, we consider forecasts for inflation in New Zealand generated from vector autoregressions, when the central bank operated within a flexible inflation targeting framework. In both cases, the economic significance of the performance differential exhibits sensitivity to the parameters of the loss function and, for some values, the differentials are economically negligible."

In this paper, we investigate the effects of United States and Japanese monetary policy shocks on their own asset markets, and the spillovers into each other's markets. However, because short-term nominal interest rates have been effectively zero in Japan since January 1998 and the United States from late 2008, monetary policy shocks cannot be quantified by considering observable changes in short-term market interest rates. Therefore, in our analysis we use a shadow short rate - a quantitative measure of overall conventional and unconventional monetary policy that is estimated from the term structure of interest rates. Our results suggest that the operation of monetary policy at the zero lower bound of interest rates alters the transmission of shocks. In particular, we find a limited response of exchange rates during the first episode of unconventional monetary policy in Japan but a significant impact since 2006."

We estimate the model for New Zealand, where a similar requirement was adopted in 2010, and evaluate the implications of an SFR for monetary policy trade-offs. Altering the steady-state SFR does not materially affect the transmission of most structural shocks to the real economy and hence has little effect on the optimised monetary policy rules. However, a higher steady-state SFR level amplifes the effects of bank funding shocks, adding to macroeconomic volatility and worsening monetary policy trade-offs conditional on these shocks.

Specifically, expansionary conventional monetary policy lowered sovereign risk in peripheral countries and longer-term bank funding risk in peripheral and core countries during the crisis, but has been unable to lower banks' markups.

Calling a technical recession after two successive quarters of negative growth can provide conditionally useful information. However, it can also signal beginning and end points for a recession that are somewhat different from those computed by our Bry and Boschan algorithm. Expansion and contraction phases of classical real GDP and employment cycles have, on average, had an 89% association, but individual cycle circumstances should additionally be assessed. New Zealand's average pattern of recovery has differed from that for U.S. NBER cycles, but their most recent recession and recovery paths have been unusually similar. We also assess whether strength of recovery can be explained by length, depth or severity of previous recessions. From our classical real GDP turning points, New Zealand's most recent recession commenced with the March 2008 quarter and ended with the June 2009 quarter. The duration of this six-quarter recession has been somewhat longer than the average recession of 4.3 quarters; but its 4.0 percentage depth has been considerably less than those for the 1951/52 and 1948 recessions, somewhat below that for the 1976/78 episode, and marginally less than the average depth of 4.1 per cent.

With 'deep' habits in demand, the price elasticity of demand rises after the fiscal expansion and it is optimal for the firm to lower the mark-up while increasing production. This in turn raises the demand for labour and the real wage rises. Consequently, agents raise consumption at the expense of leisure and overcome the negative wealth effect of the fiscal shock. We show that increasing price stickiness in a model with deep habits hinders the crowding-in of consumption. If the degree of price stickiness is high enough, consumption is crowded out by government spending. These dynamics are in stark contrast to those in traditional models where price rigidities are known to weaken the crowding-out of consumption."

We find that the extent to which firms absorb exchange rate fluctuations in the short run is significantly related to both invoice currency choice and exporter characteristics when these are analysed separately. However, when jointly accounted for, the role of exporter characteristics largely disappears. That is, some firm types are more inclined to invoice in the New Zealand dollar, while others use either the importer or a third currency. In the short run, this translates into differences in exchange rate pass through because of price rigidity in the invoice currency. Differences across invoice currencies diminish, but do not disappear, over time as prices adjust to reflect bilateral exchange rate movements."

A stable funding requirement increases rollover in long-term funding markets, despite lower aggregate rollover. Greater exposure to long-term funding markets attenuates credit expansion if funding costs rise more steeply with volumes in less-liquid long-term markets. However, it amplifies the pro-cyclical effects of fluctuations in funding spreads because variations in long -term spreads are larger and are carried for the duration of the funding (cannot be hedged). Such amplification increases in the level of the requirement and the level of net debt. We explore approaches to moderating adverse macroeconomic outcomes."

Endogenous pricing models imply that price adjustment is less frequent, and disinflation more costly, when firm-specific volatility is low.

Firms use the new port infrastructure in conjunction with the existing port in order to mitigate capacity constraints and/or access a greater range of transport options. We take early adoption of Metroport as a signal of an existing capacity constraint and analyse the effect of the new port on subsequent export growth, finding a positive but insignificant impact on export volumes."

To address that question, this paper estimates a New Keynesian model with unemployment and performs a counterfactual experiment where monetary policy strictly follows a Taylor rule over the period 2002:Q1 - 2006:Q4 The paper finds that such a policy would have generated a sizeable increase in unemployment and resulted in an undesirably low rate of inflation. Around mid-2004, when the counterfactual deviates the most from the actual series, the model indicates that the probability of an unemployment rate greater than 8 percent would have been as high as 80 percent, while the probability of an inflation rate above 1 percent would have been close to zero."

By using an over-identification restriction, the factors of the model are classified as tradable and nontradable factors. This innovation allows us to examine the relative contributions of tradable and nontradable prices towards core inflation. The results show that core inflation in both countries is primarily driven by the nontradable factor. The nontradable factor also explains significantly more of the variance in headline inflation relative to the tradable factor. Finally, both the tradable and nontradable factors show similar profiles across both countries suggesting common drivers."

That fundamental theoretical foundation provides an assurance to users of NS models that they correspond to a well-accepted set of principles and assumptions for modeling the yield curve and its dynamics. Indeed, arbitrage-free NS models will parsimoniously and reliably represent the data generated by any Gaussian affine term structure model regardless of its true number of underlying factors and specification, and even non-arbitrage-free NS models will adequately capture the dynamics of the state variables. Combined with the well-established practical benefits of applying NS models, the theoretical foundation provides a compelling case for applying NS models as standard tools for yield curve modeling and analysis in economics and finance. As an illustration, this article develops a two-factor arbitrage-free NS model and applies it to testing for changes in United States yield curve dynamics. The results confirm those of Rudebusch and Wu (2007) based on a latent two-factor essentially affine term structure model: there was a material change in the behavior of the yield curve between the sample prior to 1988 and the sample from 1988 onwards."

Three main hypotheses for this co-movement have been proposed in the literature. Firstly, an increase in house prices increase homeowners wealth, which increases their desired level of expenditure. Secondly, rising house prices may also facilitate additional consumption by reducing credit constraints to homeowners. Finally, house prices and consumption have been influenced by common factors, including expectations of future income growth. This paper uses repeated cross sectional analysis of household level data over the 1984 to 2007 period to ascertain which of these hypotheses is more valid for the New Zealand case. A positive correlation between real house prices and real household expenditures is evident for most tenure and age groupings.

At the firm level we find that measures of general and specific prior trade experience play an important role in determining the firm's future export activities. That is, we find evidence of path dependence within firms. We also find evidence of path dependence across firms, with entry into new export relationships reflecting demonstration effects from the export activities of other firms in the local area.

However, a time-series analysis of New Zealand growth over 120 years shows that global factors – such as the US growth rate and terms of trade – explain New Zealand growth fairly well, and that crisis dummy variables do not have significant additional explanatory power.

Combining evidence from both linear trends and more flexible univariate detrending filters induces strong multi-modality in the predictive densities for the unobserved output gap.

We examine this issue at the firm level using comprehensive data from the prototype Longitudinal Business Database recently developed by Statistics New Zealand. We use these data to test both optimal and selective hedging theories. Optimal hedging theory hypothesises that firms hedging choices depend on the probability and cost of financial distress, underinvestment risks, scale, managerial risk aversion, information asymmetry, governance, ownership structures and tax rules. Recent literature suggests that some firms vary hedging positions relative to their optimal position in a selective attempt to beat the market . We examine whether hedging behaviour is consistent with hypotheses derived from optimal hedging theories, and test whether hedging positions change (possibly sub-optimally) when the NZD/AUD is perceived to be high or low relative to an historical average. Optimal and selective hedging theories are both supported by the data. Estimation is over July 2000 to March 2007 (monthly) a period during which the NZD/AUD varied substantially, making this a particularly pertinent period to test exporters currency risk management practices.

Yet ex post policy analysis based on heavily-revised data suggests no fluctuations in the predictive content of money. In this paper, we investigate the predictive relationships for inflation and output growth using both real-time and heavily-revised data. We consider a large set of recursively estimated Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Vector Error Correction models (VECM). These models differ in terms of lag length and the number of cointegrating relationships. We use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to demonstrate that real-time monetary policymakers faced considerable model uncertainty. The in-sample predictive content of money fluctuated during the 1980s as a result of data revisions in the presence of model uncertainty. This feature is only apparent with real-time data as heavily-revised data obscure these fluctuations. Out of sample predictive evaluations rarely suggest that money matters for either inflation or real output. We conclude that both data revisions and model uncertainty contributed to the demise of the UK’s monetary targeting regime. Classification-C11, C32, C53, E51, E52"

This paper develops a simple model of macro stress testing, incorporating two types of feedback: one between credit and interest rate risks and another between the banking system and the real economy. The model is tested using hypothetical banking sector data. The results from the exercise highlight the importance of incorporating feedback effects for the assessment of total risks to the system, and of recognising more than one type of feedback effect in a model for a robust assessment of risks to financial stability."

I set out a putative capital requirement on housing lending intended to have cycle-stabilising properties. I explore the likely degree of cycle stabilisation that could be expected from feasible calibrations of such a requirement. I conclude that the putative cycle-stabilising capital requirement might have some impact on the cycle at the margin, and that this impact is most likely on the downside of cycles.

This size of this relationship, which has existed since the 1960s, is an order of magnitude larger than would be expected from the average change in the population and house prices in the long term. One explanation is that migration flows occur at times when locals are changing their demand for housing because of revised expectations about future income growth. A second explanation is that migrant flows have a destabilising effect on agents expectations about the fundamental value of houses. While the paper cannot satisfactorily distinguish between these two options, the results suggest that monetary policy can still be used to dampen the house price changes that occur at times when migration flows are unusually large."

The McKenna rule guided UK fiscal policy for the rest of WWI and the interwar period. We draw on narrative evidence to show that motivation for the McKenna rule came from a desire to treat labour and capital fairly and equitably, not pass WWI costs onto future generations, and commit to a debt retirement path and higher taxes.

Important advantages of our satisficing approach over policy optimisation include greater robustness to model, parameter, and shock uncertainty, and a better characterisation of imprecisely defined monetary policy goals. Also, optimisation may be unsuitable for determining prescriptive policy in that it suggests a unique 'best' solution while many solutions may be satisficing. Our analysis frames the monetary policy problem in the context of viability theory which rigorously captures the notion of satisficing. We estimate a simple closed economy model on New Zealand data and use viability theory to discuss how inflation, output, and interest rate may be maintained within some acceptable bounds.

This result generalizes to the context of a flexible inflation targeting central bank that cares about the volatility of the real exchange rate. However, when the central bank places only a small weight on interest rate smoothing and fears misspecification in only exchange rate determination, a more cautious policy is recommended for all but an exchange rate shock.

However, when we append correlated shocks – to better match summary statistics of the Australian data – we find that the costs associated with reducing exchange rate volatility are larger: output volatility increases substantially. Finally, we apply our method to a variant of a small backward-looking New Keynesian model of the Australian economy.

The Household Savings Survey (HSS), which was undertaken by Statistics New Zealand in 2001, collected data on household wealth, including the assets and liabilities of family trusts. HSS data is re-examined, with an emphasis on looking at the types of households that have family trusts, and also at the assets held in these trusts. The 2001 census, which included for the first time a question on whether a dwelling was held in a private trust, is also re-examined. It seems that many census respondents were confused by the census question, and results from the HSS suggest that the census total for trust dwellings is an undercount. HSS data, together with data on the number of tax returns from private trusts, is used to adjust the 2001 census tenure table. It was found that after adjustment for trust ownership, the home ownership rate still fell between 1991 and 2001. Furthermore, ownership rates fell for all age groups.

The analysis is carried out in the context of optimal full-information monetary policy rules in a New Keynesian model that is calibrated to represent the New Zealand economy. For the models that feature rational expectations, we support the conclusion that seeking to avoid exchange rate volatility would have more costs than benefits. Indeed, a major cost of including the exchange rate within the goals of monetary policy is that inflation expectations become less anchored to the inflation target, meaning that larger movements in nominal interest rates are required to control inflation."

Our experiment suggests that policy could be altered to increase the stability of interest rates, the exchange rate, inflation, or output, relative to the base case reaction function in FPS, but such a policy would incur some cost in terms of the variability of the other variables. In particular, we find that greater exchange rate stability would have relatively large costs in terms of the stability of all three other variables, primarily because monetary policy that leans too dramatically against exchange rate disturbances can create significant real economy variability. Relative to West (2003), we find larger costs of operating monetary policy to achieve exchange rate stabilisation. We attribute this finding to the relatively inertial inflation expectation process in FPS."

Using disaggregate price data we can directly compare the predictive performance of our core indicator with a wide range of other ‘core inflation’ measures estimated from disaggregate prices, such as the weighted median and the trimmed mean. Predictive performance is assessed relative to a centred 2 year moving average of past and future annual inflation outcomes. The 2 year centred moving average is used as an analytical approximation of the inflation target from the PTA, which requires the Reserve Bank to keep annual inflation between 1 and 3 per cent on average over the medium term. We find that our indicator produces relatively good estimates of this characterisation of core inflation when compared with estimates derived from a range of other models."

Combining forecasts from these sectoral models is much better than obtaining forecasts from a Phillips curve estimated on aggregate data.

I obtain conditions under which the monetary authority should respond directly to non-tradable inflation instead of overall inflation.

Extending the inflation averaging horizon to the medium term improves the inflation-output tradeoff by influencing inflation expectations. But how long should the medium term be?

The simulation results suggest that given a relatively short span of data it is possible for cointegration analysis to indicate that a long-run relationship has been found when in fact there is only a cyclical relationship.

There are three sources of revisions of the output gap: revisions of real GDP data, the end point problem of symmetric filters and changes to the calibration of the MV filter. The performance of the output gap with respect to signalling inflationary pressure, as measured by future non- tradables inflation, has been reasonably good, both in real time and ex post. However, during the recorded history of the MV filter, the revisions to real-time output gap have been no smaller than had a standard Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter been used. Moreover, the MV filter leads to permanently different levels of the output gap estimates if compared to a purely statistical trend. The MV filter is a hybrid construct. The empirical reference to indicators of inflationary pressure distances it from the original concept of the output gap, where a deviation of observed from potential output is taken as a cause of inflationary pressure. There is some indication that a major recalibration of the MV filter in 2002 helped to maintain the correlation with a target variable that it is supposed to ""explain""."

The estimated equilibrium can be considered a Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) that is conditional on interest rates and price levels. The large swings in New Zealand's exchange rate during the 1990s were broadly consistent with the estimated conditional equilibrium, while the equally large swings in the exchange rate since 2000 were moves away from the conditional equilibrium.

Alternatively, the long-run relationship between interest rates and the exchange rate may have changed since the 1990s."

The standard linear-quadratic monetary policy model assumes central bank preferences over key macroeconomic variables, such as inflation and output, can be usefully approximated by a quadratic function. This approximation implies that a deviation from a target is considered to be equally costly irrespective of whether the deviation is positive or negative. Combined with a linear model of the economy, quadratic preferences are useful because they yield a first order condition that implies a linear interest rate reaction function. This paper relaxes the assumption of quadratic preferences by allowing central banks to regard the costs associated with positive and negative output gaps differently. Our models also test for the possibility that positive and negative deviations of inflation from target to be treated differently. During the inflation targeting period in both countries, evidence suggests that we cannot reject quadratic preferences over inflation deviations (from target). We cannot reject that New Zealand's preferences regarding deviations of output from trend are quadratic, but Australia's behaviour does not appear to be consistent with quadratic preferences. Instead, the preferences of the Reserve Bank of Australia appear to be more accurately modelled with an asymmetric loss such that the Reserve Bank of Australia views negative output gaps as more costly than positive output gaps."

The paper works within the linear-quadratic framework and represents the monetary policy problem for the central bank as setting the interest rate in order to minimise an explicit loss function for macroeconomic variables. The government's problem is one of ""optimal negotiation"", whereby the government, representing society, joins with the central bank to search for the optimal set of loss function parameters to be embedded in a contract with the central bank. The framework, due to Rogoff (1985), is usefully applied to the case of New Zealand where recent Policy Target Agreements - contracts between the government and the central bank - are interpreted as representing society's preferences between inflation, output and other dimensions of macroeconomic stability. Within the context of an estimated, small open economy model, a sizeable stabilisation bias is found for New Zealand. Substantial reductions in the stabilisation bias can be achieved by strategic optimal delegation behaviour on the part of the government.

It begins with an overview of the financial sector reforms and a discussion of how the reforms affected households' access to credit. Secondly, the effect of a change in house prices on consumption is measured. Given that New Zealanders hold about 80 per cent of their wealth in housing, changes in house prices have the potential to materially affect household consumption decisions. Also, there is evidence that the effect of changes in housing wealth on consumption is stronger in the period after deregulation. Thirdly, the role of the household sector in the current account is discussed as banks have increasingly been borrowing overseas to fund household borrowing. The results indicate that the household sector's net overseas surplus declined by at least $7 billion over the last decade. Finaly, the ability of the household sector to weather an economic downturn is considered. Highly leveraged households are more vulnerable in times of stress, and their debt servicing capabilities might deteriorate when interest rates rise. Also, deterioration in household balance sheets could negatively impact the financial sector."

 """,2002.,Monetary policy and forecasting inflation with and without the output gap,"DP2002/03, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","Some observers have worried that under or over-estimating the output gap may unnecessarily induce tightening or loosening of monetary conditions, causing real fluctuations. To investigate the relationship between the output gap and inflation, we examine models of inflation that do and do not use the output gap. The Phillips curve, which relates inflation to real activity, is regarded as the maintained theory of inflation. Models of inflation without the output gap include the equation of exchange of the quantity theory of money, the real interest rate gap, and two versions of the P* model. Since none of these economic models are either totally wrong nor complete, it makes sense to diversify across models rather than relying on one model exclusively. The forecasts derived from different stable models can be combined through averaging, which offsets biases and reduces the forecast error variance. Such model diversification spreads the risks of errors (i.e., insurance about bad outcomes that arise from the reliance on a single model) and provides greater robustness for policy. This paper examines ten different models of inflation and estimates sixty-seven different specifications, some of which outperform others. Some explanatory variables like money and the real interest rate gap seem to provide more information about future inflation than does estimates of output gap."

 """,2001.,Modelling the long-run real effective exchange rate of the New Zealand Dollar,"DP2002/02, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.",The usefulness of the concept of an equilibrium exchange rate has been brought into sharp focus by the dramatic depreciation of the euro since its inception in 1999. Does this movement reflect a movement of the actual exchange rate relative to its equilibrium or has the equilibrium shifted relative to the perception of where the euro was in 1999? Similar kinds of questions have been asked about the behaviour of the New Zealand dollar since the latter part of 1999. To answer these kinds of questions it is necessary to have some measure of an equilibrium exchange rate and there are a plethora of alternative approaches available in the literature. In this paper we use the behavioural equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) approach of Clark and MacDonald (1999) to produce long-run equilibrium exchange rates for the effective real exchange rates of the New Zealand dollar. We demonstrate that a well founded measure of the equilibrium value of the dollar may be recovered from a relatively small set of fundamental variables and that this can be used to produce an assessment of the dollar in terms of periods of misalignment.

Yet some central banks no longer operate that way and, instead, set an interest rate for their own liabilities. This raises the question of how under that modus of operation the central bank's rate is transmitted to the financial markets. Another question concerns whether advances in information technology may erode the demand for central bank money and hence threaten the ability of central banks to implement monetary policy. There are, however, some simple answers to these conundrums. In an open and efficient inancial system, the central bank can determine the market rate of interest by standing in the market at its own rate, and rely on interest rate arbitrage to transmit that rate to the market. It follows that even if advances in information technology result in a diminished use of, and thus reduced demand for, a stock of central bank money, that need not undermine a central bank's capacity to implement monetary policy."

 """,2001.,Money in the era of inflation targeting,"DP2001/02, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","This paper provides evidence that the relationship between inflation and money growth has changed as the inflation-targeting regime has progressed. During the disinflation period (mid 1980s to mid or late 1991) the correlation between inflation and money aggregates was fairly consistent with the prediction of theory. Both inflation and money growth fell sharply. In 1992, inflation was stabilised around an average of little less than 2 per cent. Since then, the correlation between money growth and inflation has been fairly weak at the permanent (trend) and the business cycle frequencies. By contrast, there is a significant correlation between money and real GDP over the business cycle. As far as base velocity is concerned, it was stable up until December 1997, but broke down in late 1998. As money growth took off in the late 1990s, velocity declined rather sharply, but these downward trends are consistent with the decline of interest rates as predicted by the quantity theory of money. The demand for real-monetary base is well behaved and interest inelastic, but this relationship also broke down in late 1998. However, both velocity-interest rate and money demand function breakdown is probably only temporary. Finally, at least until March 1999, the rate of growth of the monetary base has, on average, been consistent with a nominal GDP targeting policy of 4 per cent."

The second methodology uses dynamic OLS and panel dynamic OLS, to test for a cointegrating relationship between the nominal exchange rate and relative prices, as well as a number of other possible explanatory variables. Using a long sample period for New Zealand, we find some tentative evidence of a stable PPP relationship for the USD/NZD bilateral exchange rate, and this model suggests that the equilibrium value of the dollar is roughly US$0.60. However, the results are very sensitive to the sample period, and in most specifications, particularly those that incorporate the recent depreciation in the New Zealand dollar, the data are unsupportive of a long-run PPP relationship. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution."

The analysis relies on stochastic simulations of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Forecasting and Policy System macroeconomic model (FPS). The analysis shows that when the policymakers' estimates of the output gap have large serially correlated errors that are positively correlated with the business cycle, both output and inflation become more variable. However, the output gap is still useful for stabilising output and inflation. Basing policy actions on the output gap directly and/or indirectly through forecasts of inflation leads to better macroeconomic stability than basing policy actions solely on currently available observable data such as inflation and output growth."

The estimates of the gap are examined to see how they compare as to the lengths and amplitudes of cycles, whether they exhibit regular periodicity and regular shapes, whether they are symmetric in phases and severity of swings, and whether they point to the same turning points. The analysis leads to the conclusion that while different filters result in estimates of the output gap with quite different properties, the three models are generally in agreement about the historical profile of the output gap, if not its precise level. Moreover, there are signs that the models are increasingly in agreement about the level of the gap, indicating that the growth cycle is becoming more regular in the 1990s."

Two key questions are asked. Firstly, which type of inflation-forecast-based rules work well when the central bank does not know the length of the monetary policy transmission lag? The results show that rules that are less aggressive and more forward looking are more robust. That is, the performance of these rules are least affected by lag uncertainty. However, it is still the case that relatively more aggressive and less forward looking rules will produce lower inflation variability. With any inflation forecasting model, policymakers must take a view on how quickly their actions impact on inflation. There will always be a significant degree of uncertainty surrounding this transmission lag such that a central bank is unlikely to get this right all the time. The second question asks, is it better to overestimate or underestimate this transmission lag? When the lag is overestimated (underestimated), the central bank behaves as if inflation is harder (easier) to control than it really is. The results show that a strategy of overestimating is superior to underestimating the lag. In fact, it may be even be a preferred strategy to knowing the true lag."

Following Feldstein (1997a, 1997b), the paper then estimates the welfare effects of going from 2 percent `true' inflation (net of measurement bias) to price stability. The benefits turn out to be about 0.4 percent of GDP, approximately half the size of those calculated by Feldstein for the US, the difference being mainly due to a less distortionary tax system.

The result is robust if direct exchange rate effects influence agents' expectations of generalised inflation and if the policy maker is uncertain about how direct exchange rate effects influence expectations.

The second source, denoted shock uncertainty, arises from unforeseen events that the analysis cannot explicitly factor in ex ante. Finally, starting-point uncertainty reflects the fact that given data lags and revisions, often it is difficult to assess the current state of the economy. This paper discusses the approach the Reserve Bank has taken to enable its Forecasting and Policy System (FPS) to quantify the implications that the typical level of shock uncertainty might be expected have on the analysis of alternative policy actions designed to achieve the objectives of monetary policy."

 """,1998.,The long-run nominal exchange rate: specification and estimation issues,"G98/5, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","The authors use monthly data from May 1973 to December 1991 to estimate a textbook version of the monetary model of the nominal exchange rate determination. They use a modified version of the Phillips and Loretan (1991) Two-Sided Dynamic Least Squares. This method accounts for the serial correlation in the residuals, the simultaneity, and cointegration among the regressors. The latter condition is consistent with the restriction that the system is homogeneous of degree zero in the money supply differential and the exchange rate. Razzak and Grennes show that most of the empirical problems known to be associated with monetary models can be ameliorated."

Quarterly data spanning the Bretton-Woods and the subsequent floating exchange rate regimes are used to test whether or not the cyclical fluctuations of output and price levels are symmetric. It is shown that the evidence of asymmetries depends on the prevailing nominal exchange rate regime and the method used to de-trend the data."

Satellite models are used to disaggregate the projections generated by the core model into a more detailed profile. The household expenditure, exports, and business investment satellite models disaggregate the relevant macroeconomic variables by modelling the shares of each aggregate allocated to each expenditure item. The models are assessed by examining their dynamic properties in response to artificial shocks and their ability to track historical data."

 """,1998.,Productivity growth in New Zealand: economic reform and the convergence hypothesis,"G98/2, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","The recent productivity experience of the New Zealand economy is examined using a cyclically-adjusted or trend measure of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). On the basis of this measure, the results of estimating a leader-follower convergence relationship suggest that productivity in New Zealand has been converging to US levels through a process of technological diffusion. The evidence also tentatively suggests that the size of the steady-state gap in the levels of TFP between New Zealand and the US decreased in the early 1990s. Although the evidence presented here is encouraging, it should be interpreted with considerable caution given that the post-reform sample period is very short and the method used to measure the steady-state levels gap is preliminary."

The results indicate that: . the general analytical framework implied by the Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) relation finds some support in the data. . in the long run, short term real bond yields are related to US real bond yields, currency expectations and expectations of the future stance of domestic monetary policy vis a vis the stance offshore. . long-term real bond yields are related to Australian real bond yields, currency expectations, inflation uncertainty and relative monetary policy expectations. . in recent years, domestic bond yields have been more closely related to offshore yields suggesting increased integration between the domestic and international capital markets. . increased perceptions of political risk appears to have played an important role in the rise in domestic long bond yields during the first half of 1996."

The technique documented in this paper augments the stochastic-trend estimation approach of the Hodrick-Prescott (1997) filter with information from broad macroeconomic relationships. This strategy is designed to improve the accuracy with which the filter identifies supply (trend) and demand (cyclical) disturbances in New Zealand real output data. The evolution of inflation over the historical period is now more highly correlated with the estimated demand cycles. Further, the conditioning information improves the updating properties of the estimation technique, relative to the Hodrick-Prescott filter."

 """,1997.,The alleged instability of nominal income targeting,"G97/6, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","Recently it has been argued that a monetary policy of nominal income targeting would result in dynamically unstable processes for output and inflation. That result holds in a theoretical model that includes backward-looking IS and Phillips curve relations, but these are rather special and theoretically unattractive. The present paper demonstrates that replacement of the special Phillips curve with one of several more plausible specifications overturns the instability result, whether or not the IS equation is replaced with a forward-looking version. Thus the instability result is quite fragile and therefore provides almost no basis for a negative judgment regarding nominal income targeting."

We cannot reject the null hypotheses of unbiasedness, efficiency, and orthogonality for a sample from 1985Q1 to 1996Q4. The survey's predictive power is better than those of the random walk and ARIMA models. During the period 1992q1-1996q1, where inflation is low and stable, the predictive power of an ARIMA model is better than that of the survey data, and the predictive power of the survey data is as good as that of the random walk model. These results are not inconsistent with rationality."

It derives several results about the efficiency of alternative rules in a simple macroeconomic model. First, efficient rules can be expressed as ""Taylor rules"" in which interest rates respond to output and inflation. But the coefficients in efficient Taylor rules differ from the coefficients that fit actual policy in the United States. Second, inflation targets are efficient. Indeed, the set of efficient rules is equivalent to the set of inflation-target policies with different speeds of adjustment. Finally, nominal-income targets are not merely inefficient, but disastrous: they imply that output and inflation have infinite variances."

 """,1997.,The inflation-output trade-off: Is the Phillips Curve symmetric? A policy lesson from New Zealand,"G97/2, Reserve Bank of New Zealand.","New Zealand data show that the inflation-output relationship is asymmetric. This asymmetry implies that positive demand shocks tend to increase inflation by more than negative demand shocks of similar magnitudes reduce it. An important implication of this asymmetry is that a monetary authority with the objective of maintaining the inflation rate within a narrow band needs to react more promptly to demand shocks than otherwise be necessary. Alternatively, policy that is slow to respond to demand disturbances will result in higher inflation, and greater losses of output than would be the case with a linear Phillips curve."

We report the development of a seasonally adjusted series for a period of more than 60 years from mid-1947, and evaluate statistical properties. The series were developed by linking quarterly observations from two recent official series to temporally disaggregated observations for an earlier time period. Annual real GDP series are disaggregated, using the information from two quarterly diffusion indexes, developed by Haywood and Campbell (1976). Three econometric models are used: the Chow and Lin (1971) model that disaggregates the level of GDP; and the Fern´andez (1981) and Litterman (1983) models that disaggregate changes in GDP. Our preferred quarterly series is based on results generated from the Chow-Lin model. We assess movements in the new series against qualitative findings from New Zealand’s post-WWII economic history."
