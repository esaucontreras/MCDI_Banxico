 """,2025.,Doing matters more than knowing: evidence from environmental preferences,"353, Bank of Greece.","This paper examines the relation between financial knowledge proficiency, financial behaviors, and pro-environmental attitudes, focusing on the willingness to pay for eco-friendly products. Individuals who exhibit stronger financial behaviors, such as saving for the future and making considered purchases, show significantly higher levels of environmental concern and are more likely to engage in sustainable consumption. The results also show that financial knowledge proficiency does not directly predict pro-environmental attitudes; rather, its influence operates indirectly by fostering sound financial behaviors. The study highlights the importance of financial habits in shaping long-term, environmentally responsible decision-making and provides insights for designing policies that integrate financial capability with sustainability initiatives to promote eco-conscious consumer practices."

 """,2025.,Bank concentration and asymmetric interest rate spreads pass through: evidence from selected euro area countries,"352, Bank of Greece.","The reaction of bank retail interest rates and deposit rates to shifts in interbank rates is influenced by the structural characteristics of the financial and banking system, as well as by the degree of competition within the banking sector. A recursive momentum threshold autoregressive asymmetric error correction model (Recursive MTAR-AECM) with non-linear adjustment is used to explore the existence of asymmetries in the adjustment of lending-deposits spreads to deviations in interbank rates for a group of selected euro countries. The findings provide evidence in favor of asymmetric adjustment in interest rate spreads and the asymmetric adjustment associated with the market power of banking sector concentration explanation of interest rate rigidity."

U.S. funds primarily liquidated high-quality bonds, like Treasuries, while Euroarea funds sold across the rating spectrum. Despite these large liquidations, portfolio allocations across ratings and sectors remained stable, suggesting proportional rebalancing to maintain investment mandates. Funds with larger shares of highly-rated bonds sold lower-rated bonds less aggressively and experienced smaller losses. Our results highlight the importance of portfolio composition for the resilience of market-based finance and the transmission of monetary policy."

 """,2025.,A new proposal for forecasting inflation in the eurozone. A global model,"350, Bank of Greece.","This paper evaluates the forecasting performance of the relatively new machine learning Global Unrefined (GlobalUN, hereafter) model with respect to inflation in the Eurozone. In this global pooled neural network framework, we use a quarterly panel dataset covering 20 euro-area countries (2001Q1â€“2025Q1) together with the EA-20 aggregate, which includes key variables such as HICP, energy prices, food, and others. Thus, the network remains simple yet flexible enough to absorb heterogeneity across countries. Our contribution of our work is crucial since monetary policy in the Eurozone hinges on accurate inflation forecasts (i.e., as ECB decisions target expected rather than current inflation). Our findings are crystal clear. The GlobalUn model outperforms all other benchmark models and the advanced machine learning XGBoost model in almost all Eurozone countries and horizons (i.e., the NAÃ VE model seems to outperform in a few cases). These results are useful for policymakers, central banks, and fiscal institutions, as they should take the GlobalUN model into account as part of their arsenal."

 """,2025.,Policy interventions to mitigate the long-run costs of Brexit,"349, Bank of Greece.","This paper examines the long-term macroeconomic impacts of Brexit on the UK economy employing a dynamic general equilibrium model that incorporates endogenous firm entry, price markups and market competition. By integrating the trade frictions introduced by Brexit, the model explains how increased trade costs have altered firm behaviour, market structure, and broader economic performance. We assess a range of policy responses, from theoretically optimal but practically difficult tax-subsidy schemes to more realistic measures aimed at reducing firm entry barriers, encouraging private and public investment, and subsidizing labour costs. Our findings underscore the critical role of policies that can most directly influence firm creation, investment, and competition in addressing the structural challenges Brexit has introduced."

The empirical specification of the model provides an overall excellent fit to the data of the euro area. To assess the effects of quantitative easing, we employ stock measures of this variable derived from the liabilities side of the Eurosystem balance sheet. We provide estimates for both short-run and long-run effects, the latter resulting from sustained increases in central bank liabilities. Our empirical results suggest that stronger effects on long-term rates arise from broader measures of quantitative easing, although these effects seem to have weakened during the negative interest rate period."

 """,2025.,Decoding climate-related risks in sovereign bond pricing: a global perspective,"347, Bank of Greece.","Climate change poses a significant risk to financial stability by impacting sovereign credit risk. Quantifying the exact impact is difficult as climate risk encompasses different components - transition risk and physical risk - with some of these, as well as the policies to address them, playing out over a long-time horizon. In this paper, we use a large panel of 52 developed and developing economies over two decades to empirically investigate the extent to which climate risks influence sovereign yields. The results of a panel regression analysis show that transition risk is associated with higher sovereign yields, with the effect more pronounced for developing economies and for high-emitting countries after the Paris agreement. In contrast, high-temperature anomalies do not appear to be priced-in sovereign borrowing costs. At the same time, countries with high levels of debt tend to record higher sovereign yields as acute physical risk increases. In the medium term, using local projections, we find that sovereign yields respond significantly but also differently to different types of disaster caused by climate change. We also explore the nonlinear effects of weather-related natural disasters on sovereign yields and find a striking contrast in the impact of climate shocks on sovereign borrowing costs according to income level and fiscal space when the shock hits."

 """,2025.,Exploring the role of technological innovation and fertility on energy intensity: Is a fresh narrative unfolding?,"346, Bank of Greece.","Amid the transition to sustainable energy systems, understanding the drivers of energy intensity is essential for informed policymaking. This paper investigates the influence of technological innovation and demographic dynamics on energy intensity across 27 OECD countries from 1990 to 2022, offering novel policy insights. Employing a multifaceted empirical strategy, we utilize dynamic common correlated effects (DCCE) estimators to address cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity, both salient features of our dataset characterized by interdependent units. The empirical findings indicate that technological innovation significantly reduces energy intensity through improvements in efficiency and the adoption of cleaner technologies. Economic openness and GDP per capita are linked to lower energy intensity, underscoring the role of trade and wealth in driving energy efficiency. Conversely, higher fertility rates are linked to increased energy intensity, reflecting population growth and greater demand for energy-intensive services. Quantile regressions uncover heterogeneity across the distribution, with stronger effects of technological innovation and credit access at specific quantiles. We find that fertility positively influences energy intensity across most of the distribution, with the effect diminishing at the upper quantilesâ€”highlighting that higher fertility is associated with increased energy consumption primarily at lower and middle levels of energy intensity. Promoting technological innovation and financial access, while accounting for demographic pressures, is essential for achieving sustainable energy transitions in developed economies."

 """,2025.,Details matter: loan pricing and transmission of monetary policy in the euro area,"345, Bank of Greece.","Does the maturity of the relevant risk-free rate influence the strength of monetary policy pass-through to interest rates on new loans? To address this question, we present novel empirical evidence on lending practices across all euro area countries, using AnaCredit data covering nearly seven million new loans issued to non-financial corporations in 2022â€“2023. We document substantial variation in (a) the prevalence of fixed- vs floating-rate loans, (b) rate fixation periods, and (c) reference rates. This variation results in lending rates being exposed to different segments of the risk-free rate yield curve which, in turn, influence their sensitivity to monetary policy changes. We show that loans linked to shorter-maturity risk-free rates experience more pronounced monetary pass-through. Importantly, this effect is not purely mechanical, as part of the effect is offset by adjustments in the premium, revealing previously less-explored heterogeneity in the pass-through to lending rates."

 """,2025.,The effectiveness of macroprudential policies in curbing operational risk exposures,"344, Bank of Greece.","Banksâ€™ focus nowadays shifts to non-financial risks, since credit and market risks are now well understood and under better control. We study whether macroprudential policy, designed to enhance financial system resilience, can mitigate or magnify losses stemming from such risks. To do so, we use a panel dataset on Eurozone countries between 2009-2018 and examine the dynamic path of operational risk exposures in response to tightening and loosening events of various macroprudential policies. Our results show that the tightening of specific measures, i.e., loan loss provisions, liquidity and loan to value, increases operational losses, whereas the loosening of measures, such as conservation buffers, loan loss provisions and debt service to income leads to a reduction in operational losses. Our results remain robust when we employ the inverse probability weighted estimator."

 """,2025.,"Formation, heterogeneity and theory consistency of inflation expectations in the euro area","343, Bank of Greece.","Using microdata from the European Consumer Survey (CES) for 11 European countries and 53 months, we investigate the formation and heterogeneity of inflation expectations as well as their theory consistency with the Phillips curve in the euro area, and across countries and demographic groups. We examine how individuals in the euro area form their inflation expectations. Our findings show that people place significant weight on their current perception of inflation. Past experiences with prices also play a role, though to a lesser extent. Importantly, the formation of expectations tends to be forward-looking rather than backward-looking. A similar pattern emerges when we analyze the consistency of these expectations and perceptions with the Phillips Curve theory. Individuals in the euro area generally do not hold theory-consistent expectations regarding inflation. We find notable variations across gender, age, income, education level, household size regarding the formation of inflation expectation."

 """,2025.,Navigating crude oil volatility forecasts: assessing the contribution of geopolitical risk,"342, Bank of Greece.","Media evidence and previous research have established that geopolitical risk is an important driver of crude oil price volatility. In this paper, we assess whether the importance of geopolitical uncertainty is also ""translated"" into valuable predictive information for oil price volatility forecasts. To do so, we construct a ""beauty contest"" where we assess the incremental predictive content of geopolitical risk against several other highly important uncertainty indicators, for forecasting horizon up to 22-days ahead. Initially, we use a HAR model which is augmented by each of the uncertainty indicators. Subsequently, we develop a Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) methodology, where we assess whether the combination of all uncertainty indices (DMA-all), vis-a-vis a DMA model without the geopolitical uncertainty index, exhibits superior predictive performance. Our findings show that geopolitical uncertainty offers superior predictive information when combined with other uncertainty indicators. More importantly, we show that the inclusion of geopolitical uncertainty in a DMA framework generates superior trading profits and risk management measuresâ€™ predictions, in comparison with benchmark models, especially in longer-run horizons. Several implications are drawn from these results."

 """,2025.,Does primary and secondary education contribute to environmental degradation? evidence from the EKC framework,"341, Bank of Greece.","This paper investigates the impact of education on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis using a balanced panel dataset of 167 countries over 21 years. By employing three econometric models with COâ‚‚ emissions, NOx emissions, and total greenhouse gas emissions as dependent variables, we analyze the role of primary and secondary education in shaping environmental outcomes. Our results confirm the presence of an N-shaped EKC, suggesting that economic growth initially worsens environmental degradation, followed by an improvement, and later a potential rebound in emissions. More importantly, we find that education plays a significant role in environmental dynamics: higher enrolment in both primary and secondary education is associated with increased emissions, particularly in developing economies, possibly due to the expansion of industrial activity and energy consumption linked to a more skilled workforce. However, at higher levels of economic development, education may contribute to environmental awareness, innovation, and policy implementation that foster sustainable practices. These findings highlight the need for targeted educational policies that integrate environmental sustainability to ensure long-term ecological benefits."

The credibility measure is derived by using the Kalman filter to extract an unobserved component from data, the movements of which are affected by central-bank credibility. We extend previous work using the Kalman filter in that we standardize the variables thought to affect credibility so that they have zero mean and unit variance. Consequently, there is no need to estimate parameters in the Kalman filter measurement equations. The credibility index is used to identify seven historical episodes during which the degree of credibility differed."

 """,2025.,The great dollar shortage debate: a modern perspective,"339, Bank of Greece.","The dollar shortage debate -- Paul Samuelson called it â€œthe big open question of our timeâ€ -- dominated international macroeconomics in the fifteen years following the end of World War II. We revisit it through the lenses of modern theory, namely, the intertemporal approach to the current account with financial frictions. We argue that its key elements, exemplified by the views of its main protagonist, Charles Kindleberger, have a remarkably modern flavor. Kindleberger identified the dollar shortage with the balance of payments deficit, a theoretically deficient but practically relevant and useful measure. He made early use of the permanent income/intertemporal approach to the current account and linked the persistence of trade imbalances to the income elasticities of savings and investment as well as to the persistence of U.S. technological superiority. The main shortcoming of the debate was the focus on the behavior of the current account rather than on the capital account as the chief reason of the dollar shortage. We also argue that currency shortages in general, whether past or present, arise from financial frictions and can occur under different international monetary systems and financial systems."

Caution is advised in the way that stochastic methods are made operational, as they are far from exact and rely on assumptions of various degrees of plausibility, which are often not stated explicitly. A Monte Carlo exercise reveals that under the approach taken by the European Commission, the measurement of dispersion can be subject to significant bias, ranging from an over-estimation by 45% to an under-estimation in excess of 80%, depending on the time-series properties of the data."

 """,2025.,Climate stress test of the global supply chain network: the case of river floods,"337, Bank of Greece.","This study investigates how extreme flood events can indirectly impact the global supply chain through production disruptions. Using a data-driven, agent-based network model that combines company-level data with flood hazard maps, the research simulates the transmission and amplification of shocks. The findings emphasize that the size of inventories is crucial; a lean-inventory system leads to faster shock propagation, higher losses, and fewer recoveries compared to an abundant-inventory system. Additionally, the study identifies that the number and criticality of flooded companies' trade links, along with the magnitude of the flood, correlate with the speed and severity of contagion. Interestingly, a key metric -the average criticality of affected firms' outgoing links- consistently peaks before the onset of the shock's fast-propagation regime. This could serve as an early warning indicator, giving businesses and policymakers precious time to react. By identifying these critical vulnerabilities, this research provides a framework for enhancing the resilience of global supply chains in the face of increasing climate-related and other risks."

 """,2025.,Trading VIX on volatility forecasts: another volatility puzzle?,"336, Bank of Greece.","This study evaluates the economic usefulness of stock market implied volatility forecasts, based on their ability to improve the short-run trading decision-making process. The current literature aligns the forecast horizon with the frequency of the trading decision in order to evaluate different forecasting frameworks. By contrast, the premise of our paper is that these should not be necessarily related, but rather the evaluation should be based on the actual needs of the end-user. Thus, we evaluate whether the multiple days ahead stock market volatility forecasts vis-Ã -vis the 1-day ahead forecasts can improve the 1-day ahead trading profits from VIX and the S&P500 futures. Our results suggest that indeed the 1-day ahead trading profits are significantly improved when the trading decisions are based on longer-term volatility forecasts. More specifically, the highest trading gains are obtained when using the 22-days-ahead forecasts. The results hold true for both VIX and S&P500 futures day-ahead trading. Although there is no theoretical background regarding the fact that forecasting and trading horizons should not be aligned, we strongly motivate this potential issue, both from the statistical and financial point of views."

We incorporate six decomposition techniques, namely, the EMD, the EEMD, the SSA, the HVD, the EWT and the VMD and four different model frameworks that of AR, HAR, HW and LSTM, which are tested against a trading strategy. We diverge from quantifying forecast accuracy solely on statistical loss functions and report the cumulative returns of short or long exposure on roll adjusted VIX futures. The findings show that decomposing a time series into its intrinsic modes prior to modelling and forecasting, can result in generating forecast gains that are translated into improved profits for trading horizons of 1 to 22 days ahead. Important trading implications are drawn from these results."

 """,2024.,Unpacking commodity price fluctuations: reading the news to understand inflation,"334, Bank of Greece.","We show that text-based indicators of supply and demand disturbances in commodity markets provide distinct information about future inflation movements relative to existing predictors, inflation expectations and survey forecasts. Specifically, we document that demand-side disturbances play a significantly larger role in prediction because they typically lead to uniform increases in quantities and prices of goods across the consumer basket, resulting in a clear and positive relationship between commodity prices and overall inflation. Supply-side disturbances matter in particular circumstances, for instance during the recent period of the pandemic and geopolitical shocks. In terms of magnitudes, the commodity-specific indicators reduce out-of-sample inflation forecast errors by up to 30 percent. We finally apply our indexes to the inflation decomposition framework of Blanchard and Bernanke (2023) and corroborate their finding that the bulk of pandemic-era inflation can be attributed to commodity supply disruptions, resulting in price increases in goods markets."

Employing confidential firm-level survey data for the Euro area countries and estimating Probit models, we find that several MAPs significantly reduce SMEs discouragement for applying for a bank loan. The marginal effects are, in most cases, highly significant, while the economic magnitude of implementing financial institutions-targeted MAPs is also significant. However, this finding is highly dependent on the degree of a firmâ€™s credit quality. Our results are driven by the demand side; a more stable and better-capitalized banking system could make SMEs less discouraged from applying for a bank loan."

In doing so, it assesses how variations in the characteristics of the banking system affect the transmission of monetary policy. The main results show that a contractionary monetary policy shock reduces both inflation and retail sales while increasing the unemployment rate. In contrast, an expansionary monetary policy shock has positive but much milder effects on the economy. Î’anking systems with higher profitability, risk exposure and lower assets-to-GDP cause a stronger effect of monetary policy on the economy. The main results hold when we consider alternative monetary policy shocks."

 """,2024.,Market power and profit margins in the Euro area countries in the post-pandemic period,"330, Bank of Greece.","The rise in unit profits has been a major factor driving price inflation in the post- pandemic period, in most euro area economies. In the present study, we attempt to analyze the factors behind this rise. One explanation provided by the literature is that the supply bottlenecks observed in the post-pandemic era, facilitated -probably temporarily- the exercise of market power of firms, who then increased their profit margins. In the paper we investigate empirically whether the degree of competition in the markets of the economies, played any role on the extent to which firms raised unit profits. We also test whether the labor market regulations had any effect on the profit margins rise, by keeping labor costs contained. We use annual panel data for the euro area economies for the post pandemic years 2021 and 2022. The econometric results confirm our theoretical hypotheses. The empirical evidence implies that structural features of the product and labor markets of the euro area economies affected price formation at the euro area, at least at the post supply shocks period, thus rendering ECBâ€™s monetary policy against inflation less effective."

The computation of the time-varying synchronization is based on the dynamic estimate of a conditional variance-covariance model and subsequently a panel regression model is used to evaluate its determinants. The findings show that island regions, industrial structure, imports, savings and disposable income are the key determinants, based on the GVA business cycle synchronization vis-Ã -vis the national reference cycle. We also assess the determinants of employment synchronization (vis-Ã -vis the national employment level) and we find that regions with higher disposable income and public spending tend to drive the level of synchronization. Turning to the inter-regional synchronization we provide evidence that investments, disposable income and employment drive the GVA business cycle synchronization, whereas the employment synchronization is determined by the level of imports, disposable income and public spending, as well as, by the status of regions as island economies. We further show that the Greek economic crisis during the period 2010-2018 has dimished or eliminated the effects of the aforementioned drivers, suggesting that during the said period, sychronisation was mainly driven by the wider economic conditions. These findings lead to important policy implications, which are thoroughly discussed."

By applying the local projection method and addressing reform endogeneity with the Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted estimator, we find that structural reforms have a positive medium-term effect on both direct and portfolio investment. In particular, reforms boost investment, especially in environments of high quality financial institutions and amid low public debt. Furthermore, building on a new indicator of cabinet policy orientation, we find that newly elected market-oriented cabinets have a positive effect on direct investment inflows. Product market reforms are more conducive to the inflow of direct investment under cabinets that prefer a state-oriented economy. Labor market reforms significantly boost direct investment and portfolio investment under governments favoring a market-oriented economy."

Tax revenues increased on the heels of major spikes in defense expenditures, even in cases where mobilizations did not escalate to war. But even in normal times, changes in mili-tary expenditures had a stronger effect on taxes, compared to similar changes in civil-ian outlays. The paper thus provides both data and evidence in support of bellicist theories of state formation for Greece, while also proposing a new approach to testing for the effects of war on fiscal capacity."

We account for uncertainty by employing composite, economic and financial risk indices and utilize alternative panel estimators with heterogeneous coefficients and an error term to consider cross-country heterogeneity. Further, we explore the effect of uncertainty on household consumption over its conditional distribution. In addition, considering the differences in economic and financial systems across the countries examined, we gauge the heterogeneous effects of uncertainty on household consumption spending. The empirical evidence substantiates the impact of uncertainty on consumption expenditures and uncovers a significant effect between uncertainty and consumption expenditure along the conditional consumption distribution. Notably, this finding appears to be stronger for the lower quantiles of the consumption distribution, reckoning the presence of asymmetries in the relationship. Our analysis has documented the importance of uncertainty in understanding and explaining consumption behavior."

We examine various types of rules (expenditure, revenue, debt, and budget balance rules) and various strict and flexible characteristics of fiscal rules. We find that the adoption of fiscal rules leads to a fiscal easing in the medium term, with the effects being more pronounced in emerging market versus advanced economies. We find an asymmetry in the workings of the fiscal rule over the business cycle. In times of expansion, the adoption of a rule leads to an a-cyclical or even procyclical response of the primary balance, while in times of recession fiscal rules induce a countercyclical impact response. Contrary to the baseline evidence, fiscal rules lead to a prudent fiscal policy response over the medium term when the debt ratio is high, the primary balance does not put the debt ratio on a declining path and the interest-growth rate differential is positive, as well as when the tax revenues generated by the tax system and tax administration are quite low relative to the stock of debt."

In particular, we explore whether the CB's bond purchases in the secondary market can restore stability and determinacy in an otherwise unstable economy. This is investigated in a dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated to the Euro Area (EA) and where monetary policy is conducted subject to the numerical rules of the Eurosystem (ES). We show that given the recent situation in the ES, and to the extent that a relatively big shock hits the economy, there is no room left for further quasi-fiscal actions by the ECB; there will be room only if the ES' rules are violated. We then search for policy mixes that can respect the ES's rules and show that debt-contingent fiscal and quantitative monetary policies can reinforce each other; this confirms the importance of policy complementarities."

Advances in technology and infrastructure are the main drivers for the reduction of emissions and are, in turn, intrinsically linked to overall country characteristics. Sound institutions can act as enablers and accelerators for firms and industries in the green transition process, hence we find an attenuating effect on emissions conditional on firm attributes."

 """,2023.,implications of market and political power interactions for growth and the business cycle II: politico-economic equilibrium,"320, Bank of Greece.","Motivated by the politico-economic systems encountered in many countries all over the globe, including those of several Southern European countries. In this paper we follow a Ramsey type optimal policy approach to endogenize government policy in the two sector DSGE model with market and political power interactions developed in a companion paper. We thus obtain what we call the politico-economic equilibrium. That is, a contingency plan for the economyâ€™s resource allocation and government policy variables that optimize the governmentâ€™s objective function, subject to the private sector equilibrium. The governmentâ€™s objective function seeks a balance between pursuing the interests of insiders and the interests of the representative household. The latter are in line with what Jean Tirole calls government pursuing policies for the â€œthe common good.â€ We take the interests of insiders to be represented by the expected value of their income. The combination of these two defines what we call the â€œHybridâ€ government. We then investigate the growth implications of the politico-economic equilibrium, focusing, first, on the steady state comparison of the hybrid government politico-economic equilibrium relative to the Second Best allocation implied by the Canonical Real Business Cycle economy; and second, on the asymptotic steady states of the politico-economic equilibrium of a Hybrid government in a detailed economy, for different degrees of insidersâ€™ influence in government. We find that increasing influence of insiders in government decision making is quite bad for the economy. The degree of influence of insiders is a deep parameter of the model that can be estimated in the data and thereby rank countries accordingly. The extent of this influence may explain the different macroeconomic performance observed among countries that, ceteris paribus, enjoy a similar state of development."

We consider two elements of market structure: producer market competition structure and the less explored structure of retail market competition. Regarding consumer behaviour we focus primarily on consumer habits. To this effect we utilise an extensive data set on retail prices and quantities for 41 product categories of fast-moving consumer goods across 58 regions in 10 euro area countries. Our results indicate that observed price differences reflect effects from diverse sources. The competition structure of the goodsâ€™ producers is found to be an important determinant of price differences. However, we also find that retail market structure and consumer habits also matter, explaining a significant and economically meaningful share of observed price differences. This points to possible new and important determinants of price differences across countries that go beyond the traditional goods market structure."

Using the case of the Greek capital controls in 2015, the events around which led to a massive loss of confidence in the domestic banking system, we show that firms whose operations were more dependent on domestic banks suffered a steep decline in imports and, subsequently, exports. This operated through letters of credit, which during the capital controls period had to be backed by firmsâ€™ own cash collateral rather than the bank guarantee. As a result, cash-poor firms imported relatively less. Public intervention to guarantee transactions is shown to help mitigate some of the decline in imports."

Our analysis is based on loan level monthly data, spanning a 42-month period, collected through the ECB AnaCredit database. Our dataset contains more than three million records, including both the pre- and post-pandemic periods. We develop a series of credit rating models implementing state of the art machine learning algorithms. Through an extensive validation process, we explore the best machine learning technique to build a behavioral credit scoring model and subsequently we investigate the estimated sensitivities of various features on predicting default risk. To select the best candidate model, we perform comparisons of the classification accuracy of the proposed methods, in 2-months out-of-time period. Our empirical results indicate that the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have a superior predictive performance, signalling better generalization capacity against Random Forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. The proposed DNN model can accurately simulate the non-linearities caused by the pandemic outbreak on the evolution of default rates for Greek corporate customers. Under this multivariate setup we apply interpretability algorithms to isolate the impact of COVID-19 on the probability of default, controlling for the rest of the features of the DNN. Our results indicate that the impact of the pandemic peaks in the first year, and then it slowly decreases, though without reaching yet the pre COVID-19 levels. Furthermore, our empirical results also suggest different behavioral patterns between Stage 1 and Stage 2 loans, and that default rate sensitivities vary significantly across sectors. The current empirical work can facilitate a more in-depth analysis of AnaCredit database, by providing robust statistical tools for a more effective and responsive micro and macro supervision of credit risk."

Responses to the survey questions to assess the level of financial literacy show that in 2021 less than 4 out of 10 respondents had a good financial knowledge proficiency level. The results also show that more than 1 out of 3 Cypriots are financial fragile, i.e., would not have been able to cover an unexpected financial need within a month without borrowing or asking for financial help. Moreover, about 6 out of 10 did not have a rainy-day fund to cover three months living expenses in case of losing their main source of income. The proportions are higher for young, not employed, low-income and larger households, indicating that these subgroups were the least resilient. These findings suggest that many Cypriot households were ill-prepared to face the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most importantly, the findings indicate that financial knowledge proficiency appears as a strong antecedent of oneâ€™s proclivity of being financially resilient.

This leads to an intertemporal inflation dynamic linking current inflation to future price behavior and inflation. Utilizing the empirical estimates from the data, we combine a Taylor rule and Euler equation with the inflation dynamic resulting from the asymmetric impact of inflation on the frequency of price increases and the frequency of price decreases. The results of the simulations capture the Greek inflation developments well.

Balance sheet policies of these central banks reduced the net supply of safe assets in the global economy, triggering a decline in global yields as investors rebalanced their portfolios towards more risky assets. We find that central banksâ€™ large-scale asset purchases have contributed to significant and permanent declines in long-term yields globally, ranging from around 330 bps for AAA-rated sovereigns to 800 bps for non-investment grade sovereigns. The stronger decline in yields of high-risk sovereigns can be partly attributed to the decline in the foreign exchange risk premium as their currencies appreciated. Global central bank asset purchases during the Covid-19 crisis have more than counterbalanced the effects of expanding fiscal deficits on global bond yields, driving them to even lower levels. Our findings have important policy implications: normalizing monetary policy by scaling down central bank balance sheets to pre-crisis levels may lead to sharp increases in sovereign bond yields globally, widening spreads and currency depreciations of vulnerable sovereigns with severe consequences for financial stability and the global economy."

By contrast, in terms of their economic significance we show that none of the oil price forecasts are capable of providing predictive gains for the eurozone core inflation rate and the Greek industrial production index, whereas some gains are evident for the eurozone industrial production index and the Greek core inflation rate. However, in all cases the oil price forecasting models, including the random-walk, generate equal macroeconomic predictive accuracy.

The issue is of particular interest for Greece, now that the economy is trying to return to a sustainable growth path following the pandemic episode, since private consumption constitutes the main component of Greek GDP. The study analyses the determinants of private consumption, paying particular attention to the significance of income and wealth. The major novelty of the paper with respect to the Greek literature on consumption is that it assumes that different types of income play a different role in consumersâ€™ behavior: so, disposable income is decomposed into its labour and non-labour components. To this end, four alternative measures of labour income are computed based on quarterly non-financial accounts data of the householdsâ€™ sector. The results indicate that decomposing disposable income is essential for analyzing private consumption. Labour income turns out to be the most important determinant of private consumption in Greece in the long and the short run.

 """,2021.,Nobody’s child: the Bank of Greece in the interwar years,"290, Bank of Greece.","Neither history nor economic historians have been kind to Greece’s central bank in the interwar years. Born at the behest of the League of Nations to help the country secure a new international loan, the Bank of Greece was treated with a mixture of suspicion and hostility. The onset of the Great Depression pitted its statutory objective to defend the exchange rate against the incentive to reflate the domestic economy. Its policy response has generally been criticized as either ineffectual or detrimental: the Bank is accused of having pursued an unduly orthodox and restrictive policy, both during but also after the country’s exit from the gold exchange standard, some going as far as to argue that the 1932 devaluation failed to produce genuine recovery. Relying primarily on archival material, this paper combines qualitative and quantitative sources to revisit the Bank of Greece’s birth and operation during the Great Depression. In doing so, it hopes to put Greece on the map of international comparisons of the Great Depression and debates on the role of the League of Nations, the effectiveness of money doctoring and foreign policy interventions more generally. What is more, the paper seeks to revise several aspects of the conventional narrative surrounding the Bank’s role. First, it argues that monetary policy was neither as ineffective nor as restrictive as critics suggest; this was largely thanks to a continued trickle of foreign lending, but also to the Bank’s own decision to sterilize foreign exchange outflows, thus breaking the ‘rules of the game’. Second, it revisits Greece’s attempt to cling to gold after sterling’s devaluation, a decision routinely denounced as a critical policy mistake.

We find that the long-run relationship between tourism and output is positive and is characterized by a substantially faster convergence of output after a negative shock than after a positive one. Using asymmetric error-correction model analysis the results show that the short-term adjustment path occurs through the level of output for negative deviations from the long-run equilibrium, thus supporting the tourism-led growth hypothesis. Linear quantile regression analysis indicates that while the impact of tourism remains positive and significant across the output distribution it is stronger at lower quantiles of output than at higher ones. Our results have important policy implications, since the tourism-led growth hypothesis is a useful policy recommendation, but it should not be considered a cure-all policy."

These interactions are motivated by the politico-economic systems of several South European countries, over the last half century. In these countries the state permits the existence of industries, typically related to the extended public sector, where firms and workers employed therein have market power (insiders), unlike other firms and workers in the economy (outsiders), as insiders, that dominate the major political parties, cooperate to influence government decisions, including those that pertain to the very existence of such a politico-economic system. Consistently with stylized facts of growth and the business cycle of these countries, the model predicts: (i) large negative deviations of per capita GDP from what these countries would have been capable of, if their politico-economic system was not characterized by the above mentioned frictions; and (ii) deeper and longer recessions in response to negative shocks, as their politico-economic system reacts so as to amplify these shocks."

In this work, we apply an autoregressive model with distributed lags (ADL) to quantify the pass through rates, that is, the degree and speed of incorporation of the changes of money market rates by banks into their customers deposit and loan rates. In doing so, for the liabilities’ side, we differentiate between open and term deposits, as well as between households and non-financial corporates. Our results indicate that for term deposits the long-term pass through rate is very high, exceeding 91% for non-financial corporate customers and 81% for households. For open deposits, the pass through rate dynamics appear less prevalent, amounting to 21% for non-financial corporate customers and 16% for households. When exploring the pass through rate dynamics in the assets’ side of the banks, we observe full long-term pass-through of money market rates, for mortgage and consumer loans. By contrast, the non-financial corporate loans rate is stickier and less reactive to money market rates changes, with long-term pass-through adjustment being approximately equal to 40%. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that the Greek sovereign spread movement has practically negligible pass through rate both for loan and deposit products. In particular, it hardly affects the pricing of new term deposits, with a pass through rate of around 5%. This finding can be attributed, among others factors, to the fact that the Greek sovereign credit spread has approached several times non-tradable territories, which makes it an insignificant variable in determining customer rates."

Moreover, the contemporaneous pandemic-induced financial shock has financial, but also real effects, including high and protracted firm bankruptcies as well as a more fragile banking sector, thus hindering the financing of the real economy. The duration of the pandemic matters for its impact on the macroeconomy, as both business investment and bank balance sheets take disproportionately longer to recover. Our findings underline the need for well-targeted policy measures to support the real economy and, secondarily, the financial sector during the pandemic and provide justification for several of the policy initiatives recently taken by governments, central banks and regulatory institutions around the world."

One explanation of this circumstance is that the ECB was unable to perform the role of lender of last resort in the sovereign bond markets during the crisis. We provide a spatial framework that allows us to distinguish among European countries whose central banks were permitted to function as lender of last resort in those markets and countries whose central banks were not permitted to do so. Our results are consistent with the view that the absence of a central bank backstop in the sovereign bond markets exacerbated feedback loops.

Fiscal tenuousness also exacerbates the effects of other risk shocks. Nonetheless, the economy’s response can be mitigated if macroprudential policy is adjusted optimally. Our analysis implies that, on the basis of fiscal strength, fiscally weak countries would favor and fiscally strong countries would object to banking union."

Inefficient pricing could imply oligopolistic practices in the market and losses to consumers’ welfare in a period characterised by a dramatic fall in consumers’ income and standard of living. A way to test whether pricing is efficient in the market is by testing for asymmetries in the adjustment of domestic gasoline prices to world oil price changes. The present paper has two aims: (a) the first is to investigate the existence of asymmetric adjustment of gasoline prices to oil price variations in the Greek market, thus contributing to the relevant literature; (b) the second is to examine whether the structural reforms that took place in the gasoline market and the large fall in income, which characterise consumers’ behaviour in the recent period, had any impact on the pricing dynamics in the market. To this end, the analysis: (i) applies the TAR-ECM threshold cointegration technique, which assumes asymmetric adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium; (ii) makes use of observations at the highest frequency available; and (iii) uses the most recent data. The results provide evidence in favour of symmetric behaviour just for the crisis period. This may reflect competitive behaviour by suppliers who had to interact in a low demand environment and under a new institutional framework following the reforms, along with a change in consumers’ search behaviour who had to deal with a severe fall in their income."

Fisher’s framework involved substantial discretion in the setting of the policy instruments; for the Chicagoans the objective of a policy rule was to tie the hands of the authorities in order to reduce discretion and, thus, monetary-policy uncertainty. In contrast to Fisher, the Chicagoans provided assessments of the workings of alternative rules, assessed various criteria -- including simplicity and reduction of political pressures -- in the specification of rules, and concluded that rules would provide superior performance compared with discretion. Each of these characteristics provided a direct link to the rules-based framework of Milton Friedman. Like Friedman’s framework, Simons’s preferred rule targeted a policy instrument."

It considers various definitions of stranded assets and its expanding scope while focusing more narrowly on climate-related risks and how these affect the financial system. Two main channels of climate-related risks are discussed in depth: risks of physical impacts from climate change and risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. Reasons why the financial system may inadequately account for these risks are presented along with corrective policies on the part of investors and central banks. The paper also considers the special challenges and threats to financial stability associated with the historically unique sustainability transition needed to achieve the targets set by the Paris Agreement.

In this study we investigate empirically the impact of market power as evidenced by concentration (CR5 and HHI) and (lack of) competition (Lerner indices) on the change in NPL ratios (ÄNPL). We use an unbalanced panel dataset of 646 euro area banks over the period 2005-2017. Since the distribution of ÄNPL is found not to be normal but positively skewed, we employ a penalized quantile regression model for dynamic panel data. We find conflicting results which are in line with the argument that more concentration does not always imply less competition. The results suggest that competition supports stability when NPLs increase but concentration enhances faster NPL reduction. In addition, we find that the effect of bank concentration is stronger in periphery euro area countries while the effect of competition is enhanced in banking sectors with higher foreign bank presence. Finally, bank competition is more beneficial for commercial banks in reducing NPLs than for savings and mortgage banks, while commercial banks are more prone to creating NPLs than the other two bank types. A tentative conclusion of our study could be that post-crisis consolidation facilitates the faster reduction of NPLs, while as the situation normalizes competition discourages the growth of new NPLs. Policy makers should take such findings into account by encouraging consolidation especially in periphery countries but also inserting competition in the banking sector through either regulating anti-competitive behavior or inviting new and/or foreign entrants."

The unprecedented growth of cross-country FDI flows has been attributed to a rich set of economic, geographical and institutional factors. In this paper we examine the role of financial system heterogeneity as a potential detrimental factor to FDI flows across OECD economies. To do so, we use a panel dataset of the most recently updated bilateral FDI data at the country level according to OECD BMD4 definition and construct measures of financial distance using a broad set of financial indicators. The econometric approach consists of a gravity-style model, estimated according to the latest advancements in econometric techniques in order to avoid omitted variable bias. The results indicate that financial system similarityis associated with increased bilateral FDI flows, a conclusion that is robust across different estimation strategies and financial distance measures. This insightful policy implication for advanced economies is that the restructuring of the financial system and harmonization to best practices can contribute to economic recovery through the FDI channel as well.

Even more, unlike the bulk of the existing literature, we take into consideration the whole supply chain, i.e. both the refineries and the retail fuel sector. Hence, we first assess whether the refineries’ mark-up responds asymmetrically to the global oil prices and subsequently whether the retailers’ mark-up shows an asymmetric behaviour relatively to changes in the refineries’ fuel prices. Our findings show that the Greek fuel retailers do not change their mark-up behaviour based on changes of the refined fuel price. By contrast, the asymmetric behaviour is evident in the refineries mark-up relatively to changes in the global oil prices, which is then passed through to the retailers and consumers. Finally, we convincingly show that weekly and monthly data mask any such asymmetric relationship. Thus, we maintain that unless the appropriate data frequency, fuel price transformations and the whole supply chain are considered, misleading findings could be revealed."

The authors point that despite the regulatory framework remaining unchanged - since Greece was the first traditional maritime country to introduce this regime in the 1970s - total taxes paid by Greek shipping companies increased by almost tenfold since the start of the Greek economic crisis. Next, they investigate the sources and mechanisms for this rise pointing a. at the impact of voluntary commitments undertaken by the Greek ship-owning community in the period of the economic adjustment programs and b. at the extension of the tax base. Next, they analyze the comparative tax burden on specified vessel types under the Greek, EU and non-EU tonnage tax regimes. The analysis reaffirms that, while shipping tax regimes have converged internationally, there are still differences in the tonnage tax bill according to alternative principles. The paper concludes that while the Greek system is considered traditionally as favorable for companies, it has become less so in terms of international comparisons in recent years, favoring, however, state revenues through the shipping crisis since 2008. The authors suggest that tax incentives to ship-owning companies can vary according to whether maritime clusters, fleet competitiveness, short-term tax receipts or long-term tax receipts are selected as optimization target and point to areas of further research."

Our evidence suggests that both features matter for mitigating inflationary pressures, in line with the relevant theoretical studies. Central bank independence alone seems not to be a sufficient condition to curtail inflation; the expected inverse relationship between central bank independence and inflation appears to hold when we account for the (inflation) conservatism of the central bank. At the same time, higher central bank conservatism seems to result in lower inflationary pressures in the economy. Our results do not support the hypothesis of an interaction (either as substitutes of complements) between the degree of independence and conservatism of the central bank."

Also, we find that there is a role for market financing of the economy but this cannot substitute for the predominantly bank-based financing. Therefore, as the Greek economy starts bouncing back Greek banks have an important role to play, first by solving the high NPLs problem and providing the necessary credit and second by improving the efficiency of capital allocation towards a sustainable growth model."

In this manuscript, we present alternative methodological approaches and specifications considered to estimate this threshold and we report updated estimates for the year 2017. The ALE threshold is defined through expenditure for the purchase of goods and services and interpreted as the income level that the household should possess in order to cover the level of acceptable living expenses, following the median expenditure pattern of Greek households. By taking into consideration the main categories of the Greek Household Budget Survey, we examined different expenditure specifications, based on the necessity of the needs covered by gradually excluding items that could be considered as “luxury” items (four scenarios were developed). Quantile regression and linear robust regression accounting for the presence of outliers was applied and various model specifications were tested. Our results control for household structure, degree of urbanization and mortgage holding, and interactions among them. In 2017, for a family with two children ALE threshold ranged from 1,196€ to 1,497€ per month, reduced by approximately 11.5% compared to 2012, depending on the expenditure specification.

This is obtained by modelling certain market conditions under which new information is released and reflected in asset prices on the one hand, and, on the other hand, by recording what established econometric testing approaches conclude, about the hypothesis of market efficiency. Amongst others it is argued that, contrary to the general belief, theoretically a random walk in asset prices, under certain conditions, could be associated with profoundly inefficient markets. Furthermore, an enhancement of the battery of statistical tests for market efficiency is proposed by the potential application of specific forms of the suggested linear dynamic model and the possible advantages over the existing techniques are discussed."

 """,2019.,The role of financial constraints on labour share developments: macro- and micro-level evidence,"257, Bank of Greece.","Technological advancements have been affecting labour shares through a steep decline in the relative price of investment goods. This has lowered the cost of capital allowing firms to replace labour with capital. Nonetheless, financing obstacles could obstruct investment in both labour and capital. This paper assesses the role of financial constraints in hampering the effect of relative investment prices change on labour shares, using data for up to 26 OECD countries over the period 1995-2014. We find statistically significant, economically large and robust effects of financial constraints acting as a channel to hinder the effect of relative investment prices changes on labour shares. In particular, our results reveal that: (i) there has been a global decline in the labour share that coincides with declines in the relative price of investment goods and this decline has been heterogeneous across countries with different levels of financial constraints; (ii) industries highly dependent on external finance face a lower decline in the labour share following a drop in the relative investment price than industries that are less dependent on external finance, possibly because they are more constrained in accessing funds to finance investment; (iii) industry-level investment prices affect the labour share partly through changes within-firms rather than through composition effects, with smaller effects for firms that are more dependent on external finance and larger effects in less financially constrained and highly productive firms. These results are corroborated by an estimated aggregate elasticity of substitution between capital and labour greater than one, and higher for countries that are less financially constrained."

 """,2019.,Solidarity in the Eurozone,"256, Bank of Greece.","Proposals for Eurozone reform aim to complete its institutional architecture by securing stability without creating moral hazard. Such policy arguments inevitably rely, however, on implicit assumptions about justice, or on what is owed to whom. A common assumption is that member states are solely responsible for what happens to them. This paper, written from the point of view of public law and legal theory, asks if this assumption is correct. The relevant idea is often considered to be that of solidarity. Yet, solidarity is a puzzling concept. Although it is mentioned in the EU treaties, it does not appear to create any clear duties of mutual assistance. Many prominent legal theorists argue that solidarity will only become relevant in the future, when new European institutions bring citizens together under a single Europe-wide political community. This paper argues, however, that these arguments are misleading. They are at least incomplete in that they miss the key role played by corrective justice. Unlike distributive justice, which applies within states but not among states, corrective justice applies to cooperative arrangements creating interdependence. Corrective justice creates a principle of redress, which requires that those who are unfairly burdened by an agreement should be compensated by those who caused the unfairness. Any state that was unfairly burdened by the Eurozone’s flawed architecture, may thus have a claim of redress for the losses it incurred as a result of the unfairness. It follows that the programmes of financial assistance were not merely actions of self-preservation or prudence by the Eurozone. They were also manifestations of an existing European principle of solidarity based on corrective justice."

The short-run impact is disproportionately more damaging for the TFP of low debt countries, while, contrary to the expansionary austerity thesis, our empirical results would advise against spending-driven fiscal consolidation, since such consolidation undermines capacity due to the importance of government spending in shaping productive capital.

 """,2018.,Financial development and FDI flows: evidence from advanced economies,"254, Bank of Greece.","Foreign direct investment (FDI) has grown dramatically as a major form of international capital transfer over the past decades. This rapid growth in cross border investment has to a large part been due to the reduction in trade and investment barriers, the harmonization and mutual recognition of regulation and the removal of domestic impediments through reform and privatization (see OECD, 2001). Amongst the numerous FDI determinants studied in the literature, the development and depth of the financial sector has gained importance during the last decade. According to the Paradox of Finance hypothesis, despite the fact that Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are not locally financially constrained their affiliates interact significantly with the domestic financial system. Hence, a deep and efficient financial system should act as a pull factor for FDI flows. Using up-to-date FDI data for advanced and emerging economies, this research explores the role of previously unavailable financial variables in attracting FDI flows. The results show that fostering an efficient financial sector with diversified funding sources for enterprises contributes to increased participation by Multinational Corporations in the host economy. This insightful policy implication for advanced economies is that the restructuring of the financial system can contribute to economic recovery through the FDI channel as well. Finally, the results highlight the importance for the full implementation of the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union in the EU."

Our estimates suggest that large-scale asset purchases and liquidity provision of major central banks following the Global Financial Crisis have contributed to a significant and permanent decline in long-term yields globally, ranging from 250 basis points for AAA rated sovereigns to 330 basis points for B rated sovereigns. Fiscally weaker Eurozone countries benefited most from Quantitative Easing, with their sovereign yields declining by 600-750 basis points, depending on the rating of their sovereigns. Our findings have important policy implications: normalizing monetary policy by scaling down the expanded balance sheets of major central banks to pre-crisis levels may lead to sharp increases in sovereign bond yields globally with severe consequences for financial stability, vulnerable sovereigns and the global economy"

(2009) and we employ a dynamic general equilibrium model in order to examine the interrelated role of rent seeking activities, institutions and government policy variables, like tax rates and public spending, on Greece’s economic performance during the last fourty years. We focus on the period 1979-2001. According to Kehoe and Prescott (2002, 2007) this period can be characterized as a great depression. The model is the standard neoclassical growth model augmented with a government sector and an institutional structure which creates incentives for optimizing agents to engage in rent seeking contests in order to extract rents from the government. This behavior creates a cost to the economy in the form of an unproductive use of resources. Our main findings are as follows: First, in terms of the path of key macroeconomic variables, our model fits the data quite well. Second, by conducting a growth accounting exercise we find that during the period 1979-1995 a non negligible proportion of the decline of total factor productivity (TFP) can be accounted for rent seeking activities. Third, our model produces an index which can be interpreted as a measure of the quality of institutions in the Greek economy. Our model based index exhibits a resemblance with the internal country risk guide (ICRG) index which is widely used in the literature as a proxy for the quality of a country’s institutions."

For identification, we study an episode of capital controls on outflows that exogenously restricted firms’ ability to pay for imports and the large-scale credit crunch that followed the imposition of controls in Greece in June 2015. Exploiting within-firm variation across sectors, we find that lack of imported inputs explains the drop in exports at the intensive margin, while lack of long-term credit is associated with adjustments at the extensive margin. Multinationals overcome liquidity constraints because of access to parents’ internal funds, but not import constraints because of stronger linkages for specialized inputs abroad. Our findings point to a novel result: the importance of both channels – real and finance – in jointly determining trade adjustment, and the different implications for the margins of trade"

Low-risk spreads are found to be more sensitive to the prospects of higher growth rates and inflation; high-risk spreads are found to be more sensitive to idiosyncratic volatility and global volatility. Also, our results indicate that primary surpluses indeed lower spreads, but this reduction is not strong enough to ‘shield’ the sovereign against volatility; thus, policy makers should avoid ‘noise’ that may undermine investor confidence by increasing idiosyncratic volatility."

The effect of card payments on VAT revenue is investigated using quarterly panel data for the 19 euro area economies covering the period 2003q1-2016q4. Time-varying coefficient methods are employed in order to estimate the country-specific contribution of compliance to revenue growth as a function of card payments. In line with the micro-data literature, the analysis indicates that increasing the share of card payments in private consumption expenditure improves VAT tax compliance. The gains are found to increase: (i) the lower the initial level of card use; (ii) the higher the share of self-employment and (iii) the lower the level of revenue efficiency.

We find that a binding LTV ratio limit in the mortgage market leads to lower credit and default rates in that market as well as lower levels of investment and output, while leaving other sectors and agents largely unaffected. Interestingly, when the level of capital requirements is in the neighborhood of its optimal value, implementing an LTV ratio cap has a negative impact on welfare, even if it leads to greater macroeconomic stability. Furthermore, the availability of the LTV ratio instrument does not impact on the optimal level of capital requirements. It seems that once capital requirements have been optimally deployed to tame banks’ appetite for excessive risk, the use of the LTV ratio could prove counterproductive from a welfare point of view."

Following this, we turn to testing debt sustainability in the long run in an interest rate sensitive environment. This is done based on a set of several varying assumptions regarding growth, fiscal performance and debt reprofiling. Analysis of the resulting scenarios points out the risks surrounding debt sustainability and draws the broad lines of future fiscal policies."

This results in increasing performance accuracy and minimizing model risk. Our main goal is twofold: First we attempt to investigate the determinants and the sensitivities of default rates in the Greek banking system where Non Performing Loans (NPLs) have risen sharply due to the sovereign debt crisis which led to a decrease in GDP from 2007 to 2016 of 25%. Secondly, the suggested statistical models can serve as the basis of projecting Greek portfolio dynamics under various macro scenarios. We find that dynamic forecasting combinations exhibit higher predictive accuracy than individual methods.

European banks have been the main source of global systemic risk with strong interconnections to US banks. For the global system, we identify periods of increased interconnections among banks, during which systemic and idiosyncratic shocks are propagated more intensely via the network.

This question is addressed by analysing international co-movements of value added growth in a multi-sector dynamic factor model. The model contains a world factor, region factors, sector factors, country factors, and idiosyncratic components. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods for 9 disaggregated sectors in 5 developed economies (G5) and 19 emerging economies for the 1972-2009 period. The results suggest that, while there exists a common ‘regional business cycle’ in the G5, fluctuations in sectoral value added growth are dominated by country-specific factors in the emerging markets. Despite that, the international factor (the sum of world and sector factors) is more important than the region factor, suggesting that the emerging markets are more synchronized with the G5. A simple regression shows that (i) the world factor would be more important the larger the share of agriculture in output; (ii) in more open economies the sector factor is more important in explaining sectoral VA growth fluctuations; (iii) the region factors is more important the richer and the less volatile the economy. Finally, a comparison of the variance of sectoral value added growth accounted for by each factor from the pre- to the post-globalization period shows convergence of the business cycles within the G5 and EM, respectively. The changes in the contribution of the world, sector and region factor are due to changes in the importance of those factors within sectors. However, for the emerging markets, the fall in the importance of the country factors is dominated by changes in the structural composition of the economies. Therefore, the evolution of the structural composition in the emerging markets could be an important driver for more synchronised business cycles at the regional and international level."

Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that banks evaluate positively the group membership and that they collect private information about the delinquent affiliated firms from other firms that belong to the group. Finally, we find that banks are more likely to show forbearance against affiliated firms with non-performing loans, in order to delay additional loan charge-offs and to preserve their relationship with the rest of the group."

In the data, official Greek GDP declined by about 26%, budget deficits proved larger and more persistent and tax rates increased by much more and tax revenue by much less than predicted. The model replicates the official output decline but implies a true output decline that is less than two thirds of that in recorded output. The discrepancy is even more pronounced for employment. The model also implies that the size of fiscal adjustment and the drop in economic activity could have been considerably milder had the informal sector been curtailed (it instead increased by about 50%).

To this end, we employ the recent foreign bank ownership dataset of Claessens and Van Horen (2014) and measure performance as profit efficiency using the alternative profit function. Results from the Battese and Coelli (1995) stochastic frontier analysis model show that creditor rights exert a positive effect on efficiency that strengthens for foreign banks. On the other hand, information sharing exerts a negative effect on profit efficiency which strengthens for foreign banks. The results for information sharing show some variability across different levels of development of the host economy. Moreover, the transparency of the host economy moderates the effect of creditor rights and information sharing on foreign bank efficiency. We also examine the effect of “institutional distance” in creditor rights and information sharing between the home and host economy on foreign bank efficiency. The effect of creditor rights “institutional distance” on foreign bank efficiency is negative, while it turns positive for information sharing. These findings highlight the importance of strong creditor rights for foreign bank performance and are useful for both regulators in host economies and foreign bank managers."

With only a few exceptions, exporters have characteristics which suggest “better” performance than non-exporters, controlling for observed and unobserved heterogeneity. This paper aims to provide evidence on the differences between exporters and non-exporters in terms of labour productivity and profitability across time, different sectors of economic activity and different size groups, using data from exporting and non-exporting firms incorporated in Greece for the period 2006-2014. The results suggest that the exporter productivity premium is around 14% for the whole sample, pointing to a significant productivity advantage for exporting firms which is even stronger in certain sectors of economic activity. There is also evidence in favour of higher productivity growth for always-exporting firms and starters, while there is a negative, though insignificant, effect for stoppers."

 """,2017.,Labour market adjustments and reforms in Greece during the crisis: microeconomic evidence from the third wave of the wage dynamics,"227, Bank of Greece.","The recession that followed the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis resulted in large falls in output and rises in unemployment across Europe. In this context, many countries implemented significant reforms of their labour market. In order to analyse the impact of labour market reforms and, in particular, to investigate, how firms adjusted to the shocks affecting them, the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) conducted a third wave of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN3) survey in 2014-15. This paper describes the main findings of the Greek WDN3 survey. The results show that the decline in economic activity, during the period 2010-2013, had a significant negative impact on Greek firms’ activity. Greek firms reacted to the shocks affecting them by adjusting both labour input and wages and reforms seem to have made it easier for this adjustment to take place."

In this paper, we focus on the impact of quantitative easing on bank level risk, while controlling for bank competition. We opt for a measure of bank specific risk-taking based on a new data set of bankrupt and restructured loans. Given issues related to endogeneity among the main variables, we adopt dynamic panel threshold and panel vector autoregression analyses that address such criticism. Results demonstrate that quantitative easing reduces bankrupt and restructured loan ratios, though we do not observe a similar impact on bank stability. Given the adoption of negative rates in January 2016 by the Bank of Japan, our study comes is timely and provides insightful implications for future research."

Time-varying-coefficient methods are employed, in order to study the role of increasing card payments after the imposition of cash restrictions in July 2015. We find that (i) a 1pp increase in the share of card payments in private consumption results in approximately 1% higher revenue through increased compliance; (ii) lowering the VAT rate can generate revenue gains; (iii) card transactions may facilitate tax buoyancy. It is argued that stronger incentives for using card payments in tax evading industries can help lock-in the recent strong revenue performance when cash restrictions are lifted."

 """,2017.,Fiscal policy effects on non-performing loan formation,"224, Bank of Greece.","The fiscal situation in an economy may have a significant impact on the evolution of Non-Performing loans (NPLs). Austerity measures limit the loan servicing capacity of households and businesses (Perotti, 1996) whereas public borrowing accelerates markedly ahead of sovereign debt and banking crisis (Reinhart and Rogof, 2010). We empirically approach the effects of fiscal policy on NPLs employing a global data set for 31 countries covering a fifteen year period. We control also for other macroeconomic factors so as to quantify effects stemming from fiscal policy measures. We employ panel data methodologies since they provide us the means to deal with unobserved country heterogeneity when examining the determinants of asset quality. We also examine the one period ahead forecasting performance of our models in line with the cross sample panel data validating suggestions of Granger and Huang (1997). Our findings imply that, on a global level, when accounting for variables linked to macroeconomic performance such as GDP growth and the unemployment rate, fiscal pressure imposed on the economy, as measured by changes in the cyclically adjusted primary surplus, constitute important determinants of Non-Performing loan formation. Also our specifications provide efficient out-of-sample one-step ahead forecasts combining effectively unobserved country heterogeneity with observed macro and fiscal determinants. Our analysis could be of great interest to policymakers since the assessment of credit risk in the banking sector is a crucial element of macro-prudential policy. In this framework, besides strict macroeconomic performance metrics one should also take into account the fiscal framework when trying to explain the key drivers behind NPL evolution."

Most importantly, the EU-SILC 2011 wave is the latest one to include an ad hoc module on the intergenerational transmission of disadvantages. Results show that a wife’s labour force participation decision is related to her husband’s mother’s and mother’s participation, and even more strongly related to her own level of educational achievement along with the number of children in the household. The labour force participation of the mother of the husband is more important than that of the woman’s own mother, indicating a strong transmission of the husband’s cultural model. Concerning educational attainment, parental educational background, and especially maternal, is identified as a key determinant of women’s high level of educational achievement."

We contribute to the literature on crisis prediction in several important ways. First, we develop an early warning system (EWS) that provides 7-12 quarters advance warning with high accuracy in out-of-sample testing. Second, the EWS applies region-wide to the leading economies in the European Union. Third, the methodology is transparent – utilizing only publicly available macro-level data and standard statistical classification methodology (multinomial logistic regression, discriminant analysis, and neural networks). Fourth, we employ two relatively novel methodological innovations in EWS modeling: ternary state classification to guarantee a minimum advance warning period, and a fitting and evaluation criterion (the total harmonic mean) that prioritizes avoiding classification errors for the relatively infrequent events of most interest. As a consequence, a policymaker who uses these methods will enjoy a high probability that future crises will be signaled well in advance and that warnings of crisis will not be false alarms."

Using a panel of ten European Union member countries for the period 1988-2005 we obtain the statistical results that support the existence of a non trivial relationship between price cost margin and fiscal policy, as it is expressed by the fiscal balance of a country. There are differences, however, between countries as well as industries reflecting different production and labor market conditions."

This is done based on aggregate portfolio loans in the Greek economy. Greece constitutes an interesting case to study the factors determining NPLs, given the pervasive recessionary conditions that have characterized it since the outbreak of its sovereign debt crisis in 2010. We suggest a new econometric framework to study the above relationship which extends the SUR (seemingly unrelated regressions) framework to allow for a common break in its slope coefficient of unknown date. We show that the deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions (captured by very high rates of unemployment) and political uncertainty constitute key factors explaining the sharp rise of NPLs of the Greek banking sector after the first quarter of 2012. With the exception of bank profitability, we find that bank specific variables associated with bank capitalization and liquidity risk seem to determine NPLs only under normal economic conditions."

The increase in NPLs post crisis has put into question the robustness of many European banks and the stability of the whole sector. It still remains a serious challenge, especially in peripheral countries which are hardest hit by the financial crisis. By employing both Fully Modified OLS and Panel Cointegrated VAR we estimate that NPLs are affected by the same macroeconomic and bank-specific conditions but the responses are stronger in the periphery. Following the FMOLS estimations NPLs in the euro area have performed an upward (much higher in the periphery) shift after 2008 and are mostly related to worsening macroeconomic conditions especially with respect to unemployment, growth and taxes. Fiscal consolidation and interest rate margins are significant for the periphery while credit to GDP is significant only for the core. Quality of management and loans to deposits play an important role, while size is negatively significant only in the periphery. Most of these findings were confirmed by the panel Cointegrated VAR results. A chi-square test comparing the estimated coefficients for the core and periphery NPLs rejects the hypothesis of equality revealing another aspect of banking fragmentation in the euro area. Such findings can be helpful when designing macro-prudential as well as NPL resolution policies, which should be adjusted appropriately to the different responses between core and periphery banks."

 """,2016.,Insights on the Greek economy from the 3D macro model,"218, Bank of Greece."," This paper examines the macroeconomic and welfare implications of banking capital requirement policies and their interactions with real and financial shocks for the Greek economy. The model employed is that of Clerc et al. (2015), a DSGE model featuring a detailed financial sector, banking capital regulations and bank default in equilibrium. The key model implication is that capital requirements reduce bank leverage and the default risk of banks but their relationship with social welfare is hump-shaped, reflecting a trade-off. The model is calibrated to data on the Greek economy and the dynamic responses to a number of financial and real shocks which may have played a material role in the unfolding of the Greek crisis are explored. The results indicate inter alia that an increase in the depositors’ cost of bank default leads to a substantial increase in the deposit rate, a decline in deposits and bank equity and an increase in bank fragility, while on the real side of the economy the decline in total credit prompts a deterioration of key macro variables. Additionally, the results imply that while recapitalizations increase bank net worth and credit supply and boost economic activity, this potential benefit is severely compromised in a high financial distress scenario, as the positive real and financial implications of a recapitalization become both smaller and more short-lived."

 """,2016.,"Alternatives to large VAR, VARMA and multivariate stochastic volatility models","217, Bank of Greece."," In this paper, our proposal is to combine univariate ARMA models to produce a variant of the VARMA model that is much more easily implementable and does not involve certain complications. The original model is reduced to a series of univariate problems and a copula – like term (a mixture-of-normals densities) is introduced to handle dependence. Since the univariate problems are easy to handle by MCMC or other techniques, computations can be parallelized easily, and only univariate distribution functions are needed, which are quite often available in closed form. The results from parallel MCMC or other posterior simulators can then be taken together and use simple sampling - resampling to obtain a draw from the exact posterior which includes the copula - like term. We avoid optimization of the parameters entering the copula mixture form as its parameters are optimized only once before MCMC begins. We apply the new techniques in three types of challenging problems. Large time-varying parameter vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR) with nearly 100 macroeconomic variables, multivariate ARMA models with 25 macroeconomic variables and multivariate stochastic volatility models with 100 stock returns. Finally, we perform impulse response analysis in the data of Giannone, Lenza, and Primiceri (2015) and compare, as they proposed with results from a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model."

At the same time, productivity growth has consistently disappointed in the aftermath of the last recession. This has raised doubts about the long-term growth prospects of the US economy and led to worries about secular stagnation. This paper contributes to the debate by empirically revising the main determinants of labour productivity growth over the period 1999-2013 for a panel of US states, focusing on capital deepening, R&D spending, the sectoral composition, financial factors and business dynamism. We find that more than half of the slowdown in productivity growth in the period 2011-13 relative to its sample average is due to a decline in the rate of capital deepening. The other major factor explaining the recent weakness in productivity growth - more closely related to TFP - is the slowdown in business dynamism experienced by the US economy. By contrast, financial factors appear to have become supportive of productivity growth in that period."

Data refer to 2010 when the first elements of the economic adjustment programme to deal with the chronic deficiencies of the Greek economy and restore sustainable public finances, competitiveness and set the foundation for long-term growth were beginning to be implemented. Results point to high wage dispersion across industries at the mean of the conditional wage distribution, even after controlling for personal and workplace characteristics. However, evidence for the unobserved heterogeneity hypothesis is rather scant. Therefore, there is room for efficiency wage or rent-sharing theories in accounting for a large part of inter-industry wage differentials tentatively implying that firm heterogeneity in the ability-to-pay matters more than employee unobservable attributes in the wage determination process."

Eric Rauchway’s The Money Makers: How Roosevelt and Keynes Ended the Depression, Defeated Fascism, and Secured a Prosperous Peace (Basic Books, 2015) tells the story of the ways Franklin D.

Furthermore, we investigate potential determinants of firms’ behavior by relating the probability of strategic default to a number of firm characteristics such as size, age, liquidity, profitability and collateral value. We provide evidence of a positive relationship of strategic default with outstanding debt and economic uncertainty and a negative relationship with the value of collateral. Also, profitability and collateral can be used to distinguish the strategic defaulters from the financially distressed defaulters. Finally, we find evidence that the relationship of strategic default risk with firm size and age has an inverse U-shape, i.e. strategic default is more likely among medium-sized firms compared to small and large firms and it is also more likely among middle-aged firms compared to new-founded and established firms."

 """,2016.,The re-pricing of sovereign risks following the global financial crisis,"210, Bank of Greece.","How strong has been the effect of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on systemic risk in sovereign bond markets? Was the increase in credit spreads relative to triple-A benchmarks which followed the GFC the result of higher sovereign credit risk or the result of a re-pricing that reflected changes in broader market conditions and risk aversion? In this paper we examine these issues by specifying a sovereign credit yield curve which relates sovereign yield spreads to credit ratings and global variables. The model allows for time-variation in both the price of credit risk and the average spread across all rating categories, which proxies the effect of global risk factors on yield spreads. We use daily data of ten-year bond yields and ratings from a large database of 64 countries, covering both emerging markets and developed economies, for the period from 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2015. Our estimates suggest that sovereign risk premia increased significantly after the GFC with most of the increase due to a re-pricing of broader market risks rather than an increase in the quantity or price of sovereign risk per se. This increase in global risk could be the result of a flight-to-quality from lower-rated sovereign bonds to AAA benchmark bonds. Interestingly, we find that global risk in the sovereign bond market is driven by global variables that relate to investor confidence, volatility risk, central bank liquidity and the slope of the yield curve in the US."

This finding appears to be robust to a number of control variables and robustness tests. Moreover, the impact of credit conditions is not uniform across firms, but rather it varies depending on firm size and leverage, with constrained firms being substantially more likely to condition their investment decisions on overall credit conditions.

He believed that the economy is inherently unstable because of endogenous movements in money supply under a fractional-reserve banking system. In her work, Anna Schwartz downplayed the role of monetary factors in business cycles and the role of monetary policy as a stabilization tool. We show how the joint work of Friedman and Schwartz from 1948 to 1958 led Friedman to view money as the “primary mover” of the business cycle and underpinned his shift to a rule based on money growth so that discretionary monetary policy would not act as a source of destabilizing shocks. The decisive factor in the evolution of Friedman’s thinking was the empirical confirmation that the Great Depression had been both initiated and deepened by the Fed. The largely neglected influence of Clark Warburton on the evolution of Friedman’s thinking provides a missing -- but crucial -- link in explaining Friedman’s recognition of the role of monetary factors in the Great Depression and of the Fed’s ability to offset the destabilizing effects produced by shifts from deposits into currency under a fractional-reserve banking system."

 """,2016.,Credit risk stress testing for EU15 banks: a model combination approach,"203, Bank of Greece."," In bank stress tests, the role of a satellite model is to tie bank-specific risk variables to macroeconomic variables that can generate stress. For valid stress tests it is important to develop a comprehensive satellite model that both preserves the sense of known economic relationships and also exhibits high predictive ability. However, it is often difficult to achieve these desiderata in a single satellite model. Multicollinearity of key macro variables and limited data may militate against inclusion of all important stress variables, thus limiting the range of stress scenarios. In order to address this problem we depart from the custom of using a single model as the ""true"" satellite. Instead, we generate a full space of candidate models that we then screen for reasonable candidates that remain sufficiently rich to cover a wide range of stress scenarios. We then develop composite models by combining the surviving candidate models through weighting. The result is a composite satellite model that includes all the desired macroeconomic variables, reflects the expected relationships with the dependent variable (NPL growth) and exhibits more than 20% lower RMSE compared to a commonly used benchmark model. An illustrative stress testing application shows that this approach can provide policy makers with prudent estimates of credit risk."

Export quality in agriculture displays a slightly upward trend with the average annual rise over the period 1998-2012 amounting to 1.6%. Linking the quality estimates at the product level with exporting firms in the manufacturing sector shows that higher product quality is associated with firms that have a higher share of their wage bill paid to skilled workers. This positive relationship stems from firms with higher skilled to unskilled employment ratios, rather than higher wage skill premia, and is more pronounced in large and rich destinations."

Using a broad dataset covering 96 countries and 272 recovery episodes, we provide empirical evidence that credit-less recoveries are indeed associated with both low and declining financing needs of the private sector, as proxied by the investment-savings gap at the trough of the recession and its adjustment during the downturn. We show that this reflects a rebalancing of wealth towards financial assets during the downturn which can subsequently be used to finance real investment during the recovery stage, even in the absence of positive bank credit flows. Lastly, we provide empirical evidence that, controlling for the change in investment-savings imbalances, economies whose economic downturn was preceded by a credit boom are more likely to experience a credit-less recovery."

We find that significant heterogeneities existed even before the global financial crisis and remained in its aftermath, although the magnitude and the direction of the effects exercised by the explanatory variables have changed. Furthermore, apart from finding that market concentration and the prudence of banks’ management increase the lending margins NFCs pay for their loans, there is evidence of substitution effects between financing obtained from banks and corporate bond markets. The provision of ample liquidity from the ECB, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis was found to be effective only for the core countries, suggesting that further policy actions are needed in order to reduce the fragmentation of bank lending and promote financial integration to the benefit of the euro-area real economy."

The set-up is a DSGE model calibrated for the Greek economy. The results show that structural reforms produce important long-run GDP gains that materialize earlier, the faster the reforms are implemented. When implemented jointly with fiscal consolidations, structural reforms may amplify the short-run costs of fiscal tightening. The GDP dynamics depend on the fiscal instrument used for public debt consolidation. In the long run, however, there are complementarity gains irrespective of the fiscal instrument used."

To this end a static computable general equilibrium model is presented, that is capable of simulating the main macroeconomic and especially distributional aspects of the Greek crisis that has afflicted the country since 2008. The model is designed to explore in a comparative static manner the outcomes of different policies, and has considerable sectoral and distributional detail. The model is fitted to a 2004 social accounting matrix that includes much detail about the relevant economic actors. Policy simulations are made under a closure rule that seems to fit the Greek economy during the crisis. Simulations of the large shocks that have affected Greece between 2008-2013 indicate that the model reproduces the main outcomes of the economy during the implementation of the policy package adopted during the crisis, and indicates that the package adopted has been very regressive. The policy simulations suggest that the mixture of policies adopted during the stabilization programme by the Greek government has resulted in a large GDP decrease, a large employment decline, and as a painful consequence, a substantial decrease in the public sector deficit, but at the cost of very large decreases in private real incomes and an even larger increase in income inequality. It remains to be seen whether there can be other policy packages that can achieve similar public sector deficit reductions without the adverse income and distributional implications"

Was the priority given to preserving financial stability justified? Are stability and growth objectives possible in EMU? What is the scope for national economic policy in the new policy framework? It emerges from the analysis that, after some initial weaknesses in policy action, decisive initiatives by EU authorities, supported by significant progress to strengthen further economic and financial governance and reduce macroeconomic imbalances succeeded in preserving the stability and integrity of the euro area. While the priority given by the EU policy action to financial stability was fully justified, it is also clear that robust economic growth is essential for durable financial stability and overall welfare. Policies enhancing both stability and growth are possible in EMU and some of them have started being implemented while others are at an advanced stage of development. There is ample scope for national economic policies which, if well-designed and properly implemented, will enhance the growth potential of member countries. However, legacy problems such as the excessive government debt burden in some countries must be resolved"

Using dynamic panel data techniques and a unique data set, including supervisory data, covering the whole Greek commercial banking system from 2004 to 2011, we find that net interest income is primarily affected by the banks’ market power, their operating costs and their strategic choice to diversify their income sources by enhancing non-interest income. On the other hand, non-interest income is more persistent than net interest income, with the more efficient banks, possessing a strong deposit base, having greater leverage in boosting their non-interest income. Aggregate demand conditions and inflation can also affect both income components. Moreover, interest- and non-interest income are found to be substitutes rather than complements, with non-interest income used as an indirect competition instrument by efficient banks, instead of competing directly with their peers through prices in loans and deposits."

Evidence from a Time Varying FAVAR,"190, Bank of Greece.","In this paper, we examine the international transmission of US monetary policy shocks across euro area and Asian countries by using a FAVAR model. We first examine all possible channels through which a policy shock is transmitted to each country. In general the transmission of the shock hides considerable heterogeneity across the countries. We find that the trade balance is important in explaining GDP spillover effects in the case of Singapore. Wealth effects along with the world interest rate channel explain the negative propagation of the US shock to the GDP of Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore. The exchange rate channel can explain the positive spillover effects on GDP in Korea and Japan. For the euro area, an endogenous response of the euro area monetary authority is observed. The wealth effect through the role of effective exchange rates seems adequate to describe the transmission of the shock to European countries. For Germany and Italy the decline in lending and spending reveal the importance of the balance sheet channel in the shock transmission. Second, we investigate to what extent the transmission mechanism has changed over time. For the 2007 financial crisis, our results indicate that the majority of the countries in both regions witness an increase in the size of the shock to real activity, inflation and credit variables in the post crisis period."

That holds for both the pre- and post-2007 periods and especially for banks that tend to operate with above median leverage among their peer group. As a result, RoE targeting could affect leverage dynamics and amplify cyclical fluctuations as banks take on more leverage to achieve high returns when risk premia are low, while ‘rush for the exit’ and delever to contain losses when the cycle turns. Therefore, recent proposals that aim to align executive pay with long-term performance by restricting the use of profitability metrics such as RoE from remuneration schemes seem to be in the right direction."

Aggregate fiscal multipliers are estimated in the region of 0.5, although we find considerable variation depending on the fiscal mix, the degree of openness and the state of the economy. During episodes of recession, tax hikes become significantly more costly in terms of output than expenditure cuts. This appears to be related to increases in the share of hand-to-mouth consumers, proxied by the unemployment rate. Fiscal effects are generally more muted in open economies and during periods of positive growth. Country-specific features in Greece lead to significantly higher estimates, possibly in excess of unity in 2011, reflecting predominantly sizeable revenue effects."

The values of the estimated unconditional elasticities are similar in size and range, and the same holds true for country-specific wage-elasticities of labour demand.

This question has never been empirically addressed despite its profound importance especially since many developed countries have embarked on fiscal consolidation programmes, which in many cases have led to sizeable increases in unemployment and poverty, and are met with public dissatisfaction. Using a data set for 29 OECD countries over the period 1971-2009, we argue that fairness matters, namely that improving the targeting of social transfers and their effectiveness in terms of poverty alleviation, higher public expenditure on training and active labor market policies and programmes like social housing directed to the poor, even decreasing the VAT rate on necessities, improve the success probabilities of consolidation attempts. Introducing such concerns sheds new light on the prevailing view that the successful fiscal adjustments are those that rely on spending-cuts rather than on tax increases. The results of this paper provide empirical evidence that ameliorating the effects of adjustment, by supporting the weaker parts of society, is crucial for the success of fiscal consolidations and argues that ""fair fiscal adjustments"" may provide the double dividend of enhancing the probability of success of the adjustment and of promoting social cohesion."

Robustness is established by estimating alternative specifications producing comparable results using absolute or relative prices and allowing for cyclical effects. More specifically, we show that during an economic crisis (given that for large part of the sample period credit has been declining) a 10 percent drop in firm financing leads to a decline in export growth by 6 to 9 percent in the short-run and by 2 to 4 percent in the long-run. Additionally, a similar increase in bank financing during an economic recovery is expected to produce a 6 to 9 percent increase in exports a result which will lead to an approximate increase of 1 to 2 percent to current GDP and economic growth."

The main objective of the present study is to advocate this shift and shed light on various policy options for achieving this goal. Specifically, the paper makes a first tentative attempt to delineate the scope of the cultural and creative economy, to map its various components and aspects and to provide a quantitative view of how Greece fares in this new sector of activity. It goes on to outline the specific features of the sector of culture and creativity in Greece and concludes with ten practical recommendations that would foster the emergence of a virtuous circle linking culture, creativity and economic growth."

Our estimates indicate that intra-EMU integration effect improved in both equity and bond markets during the period close to the formation of EMU i.e. 1997, 2001 and 2002. In the case of the EMU equity market, this effect is mostly centered on 2001 (18% increase of EMU holdings) reflecting the beneficial impact of EMU and the introduction of the euro, while in the case of bond market this EMU effect is centered on 1997 (50%), reflecting the existence of pre-EMU integration effects. These integration effects have been also accompanied by increased demand from the side of non-EMU investors in both markets. Lastly, these integration effects weaken significantly after 2007, mainly reflecting a post-crisis disintegration of EMU capital markets both internally and globally.

However, post-2008, the credit crunch seems to seriously affect only slow-growth firms and especially those operating in domestic bank-dominated economies. Furthermore, the classification of firms in groups by size yields interesting results: the credit crunch exhibits a strong impact on small firms only. Separate estimates for more and less financially developed economies show that the credit crunch matters mainly in countries with a lower degree of financial development. Moreover, our findings reveal that the degree of banking concentration affects firm growth in a negative way in most estimates. Finally, risk and financial stability matter for firm growth for the total sample and for domestic bank-dominated economies, while in general they do not matter when markets are dominated by foreign banks."

The findings show that a hazard model that incorporates three accounting ratio components of Z-score and three market-driven variables is the most appropriate model for the prediction of corporate financial distress in Greece. This model outperforms a univariate model that uses the expected default frequency (EDF) derived from the Merton distance to default model, a multivariate model that is exclusively based on accounting variables, a model that combines EDF and accounting variables and a multivariate model that uses only market-driven variables. In-sample forecast accuracy tests confirm the main results. The out-of-sample evidence also suggests that the model yields the highest predictive ability during financial crisis when using data prior to the financial crisis."

The important policy implication of this asymmetry is that a consecutively positive growth would lead imports to continuously increase causing the current account deficit to persistently widen.

Thus, we test, rather than assume, stationarity of near-unit-root processes. In addition, we set out an empirical framework for assessing relationships between locally non-stationary series. In this context, we test the rational expectations hypothesis by allowing the co-existence of a long-run relationship obtained under the rational expectations restrictions with short-run ""learning"" effects. Our empirical results indicate that the rational expectations hypothesis holds in the long run, while forecasters adjust their expectations slowly in the short run.

The key factor that abetted those imbalances was the absence of a short-to-medium term adjustment mechanism -- due to perceptions of sovereign bailouts -- in the euro-area that would have reduced members’ external imbalances. This situation contrasts sharply with the adjustment mechanism under the classical gold standard. Under the gold standard, countries with external deficits would experience losses of gold reserves, higher interest rates, lower money and credit growth, and reductions in wages and prices, which helped restore trade competitiveness. We draw two main conclusions. First, the durability of a monetary union is crucially dependent on the existence of a well-functioning adjustment mechanism. Second, adherence to a hard peg is no panacea and cannot be sustained without the support of credible fiscal institutions."

We use multivariate cointegration techniques to estimate a vector error correction model (VECM) and identify separate demand and supply relationships for consumer loans. We introduce demand and supply-related shifts in parameters through the inclusion of appropriate dummy variables and trends in the long-run relationships. We partly deviate from the typical Johansen procedure and estimate the model in two steps. We find that the theoretical exclusion and coefficient-size restrictions on the demand and supply cointegrating vectors are valid. Our results are consistent with the operation of a bank lending channel in Greece. We also find that the supply side was mostly responsible for the acceleration of consumer loan growth following credit liberalisation."

Due to procyclicality, banks are transformed from mitigation mechanisms to amplifiers of changes in economic activity potentially affecting financial stability. The causes of procyclicality can be attributed to market imperfections and deviations from the efficient market hypothesis, while other factors -including Basel II and accounting standards- may have exacerbated it. To attenuate procyclicality, a number of suggestions have been made in the form of rules and discretion and are presented according to the factors they aim to alleviate. Some of the suggestions have been adopted under the Basel III framework, including the countercyclical capital buffer. Although these Basel III proposals seem able to address the procyclicality issue, they will lead to higher minimum capital adequacy ratios, which are expected to increase lending costs and the provision of loans by banks, and reduce economic activity. However, the cost of the new proposals is expected to be lower than the estimated cost of financial crisis."

The inconsistency is remedied by replacing the Taylor rule with a standard money demand equation. The modified system is seen to possess the key properties of monetarist theory for the long run, i.e. monetary neutrality with respect to real output and the real interest rate and proportionality between money and prices. Both the modified and the original New-Keynesian models are estimated on US data and their dynamic properties are examined by impulse response analysis.

A divide seems to separate two groups in the euro area, one with the northern countries achieving external surpluses and the other including the southern countries with large external deficits. We argue that a crucial factor in shaping productivity, and consequently affecting competitiveness and the external position of the economy, is the size and composition of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and find that the northern countries received more total FDI than the southern group. Moreover, the southern countries attracted more investment in real estate rather than the productive sector. Focusing on ten euro area economies over the period 1980-2009, we establish a positive relationship between FDI flows and trade balances in the northern countries, in contrast to a negative one for the southern group. Using industry-level data, we also establish a positive (negative) long-run relationship between FDI in the manufacturing (non-manufacturing) sector and the trade balance for the northern (southern) countries."

To this end daily closing price of stocks traded at the Athens Stock Exchange are used. Empirical evidence is provided for the existence of: (a) conditional heteroscedasticity in MM residuals; (b) a pronounced intervalling effect on ARCH in MM residuals; (c) GARCH in mean type of conditional heteroscedasticity for the majority of cases where ARCH was present in MM residuals. These findings in terms of theory are conducive to a conditional CAPM, which takes into account the effect of conditional variance on expected returns, rather than the standard CAPM. Furthermore, in terms of practical implications these findings may lead to better estimates of systematic risk."

 """,2011.,Unveiling the monetary policy rule in euro area,"130, Bank of Greece.","This paper provides evidence that, since the sign of Maastricht Treaty, euro-area monetary authorities mainly follow a strong anti-inflationary policy. This policy can be described by a threshold monetary policy rule model which allows for distinct inflation policy regimes: a low and high. The paper finds that these authorities react more strongly to positive deviations of inflation and/or output from their target levels rather than to the negative. They do not seem to react at all to negative deviations of output from its target level in the low-inflation regime. We argue that this behaviour can be attributed to the attitude of the monetary authorities to build up credibility on stabilizing inflationary expectations. To evaluate the policy implications of the above euro-area monetary policy rule behaviour, the paper simulates a small New Keynesian model. This exercise clearly indicates that the absence of reaction of the euro-area monetary authorities to negative output gap when inflation is very low reduces their efficiency on dampening the effects of negative demand shocks on the economy."

The evidence suggests that external labour market conditions are less important than internal pay structures in determining hiring pay, with internal pay structures binding even more often when there is labour market slack. When explaining their choice ﬁrms allude to fairness considerations and the need to prevent a potential negative impact on effort. Cross-country differences, that do exist, are found to depend on institutional factors (bargaining structures); countries in which collective agreements are more prevalent and collective agreement coverage is higher report to a greater extent internal pay structures as the main determinant of hiring pay. Within-country differences are found to depend on ﬁrm and workforce characteristics; strong association between the use of external factors in hiring pay, on the one hand, and skills (positive) and tenure (negative) on the other."

In this context, the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has been recently proposed in order to obtain a globally flexible functional form which is capable of approximating any existing output distance function while enabling the a priori imposition of the theoretical properties dictated by production theory, globally. Previous work has proposed and estimated the so-called Neural Distance Function (NDF) which has numerous advantages when compared to widely adopted specifications. In this paper, we carefully refine some of the most critical characteristics of the NDF. First, we relax the simplistic assumption that each equation has the same number of nodes because it is not expected to approximate reality with any reasonable accuracy and different numbers of nodes are allowed for each equation of the system. Second, we use an activation function which is known to achieve faster convergence compared to the conventional NDF model. Third, we use a relevant approach for technical efficiency estimation based on the widely adopted literature. Fitting the model to a large panel data we illustrate our proposed approach and estimate the Returns to Scale, the Total Factor Productivity and the Technical Efficiency in US commercial banking (1989-2000). Our approach provides very satisfactory results compared to the conventional model, a fact which implies that the refined NDF model successfully expands and improves the conventional NDF approach."

Among its determinants, distance has been found to be critical. But does distance only have a simple negative direct effect? Or is the role of geography more intricate? Applying spatial analysis techniques on BIS data of bank foreign claims in 178 countries in 2006, evidence of positive spatial autocorrelation under alternative spatial weights schemes is brought to light. The geographical aspects of international banking are further explored by a spatial autoregressive gravity model. The results obtained support that the operation of a spatial lag leads to important indirect or third-country effects. Evidence of such financial spillovers is further corroborated by results of a spatial autoregressive Tobit model. Geography is more important than the effect of distance on its own would suggest. Third-country effects operate in a manner that subsequently connects countries through links beyond those immediately involved in borrowing (destination) and lending (origin) relationships. Confirming earlier results, the economic size of sending and recipient countries, cultural similarity and in-phase business cycles enhance international banking, while distance and exchange rate volatility hinder it. Also, while lower political risk has a positive role, so do higher financial and economic risks, reflecting-to some extent-some of the reasons behind the current financial crisis."

To compare different policy regimes, we compute the welfare-maximizing value of the second-best policy instrument in each regime. In all cases studied, pollution permits are the worst recipe, even when their revenues are used to finance public abatement. When the main source of uncertainty is economic, the best recipe is to levy taxes (on pollution or output) and use the collected tax revenues to finance public abatement. However, when environmental uncertainty is the dominant source of extrinsic uncertainty, Kyoto-like rules for emissions, being combined with tax-financed public abatement, are better than taxes.

Concerns over Greece’s external sustainability have emerged since 1999 when the current account deficit widened substantially and exhibited high persistence. The empirical model used, which theoretically rests on the intertemporal approach, treats the current account as the gap between domestic saving and investment. We examine the behaviour of the current account in the long run and the short run using co-integration analysis and a variety of econometric tests to account for the effect of significant structural changes in the period under review. We find that a stable equilibrium current account model can be derived if the ratio of private sector financing to GDP, as a proxy for financial liberalization, is included in the specification. Policy options to restore the country’s external sustainability are explored by performing a simulation exercise based on the estimated equilibrium model."

Thus we formulate sovereign bond yield spreads, for eleven EMU countries against the Bund for the period 1992:1-2009:12, as AR(1) processes, while allowing for regime switching effects, along the lines of a Markovian probabilistic specification. Specifically, by taking into account regime switching effects we examine, rather than assume, that monetary unification affected sovereign bond yield spreads, allowing for states of higher and lower interactions to be revealed. Next, we examine the effects of several exogenous explanatory variables. Our results indicate that European sovereign bonds achieved only partial integration even before the recent financial crisis, while financial integration and financial stability are found to be interconnected. Specifically, we find evidence of different effects exercised by the same deterministic factors on sovereign bond yield spreads even before the recent crisis. Additionally, it appears that a negative relation exists between low-volatility conditions and the magnitude of effects exercised by idiosyncratic risk factors on bond yield spreads."

As a result we illustrate different short-run relations referring to the periods before and after monetary union. Overall, our empirical results indicate that stronger interactions between the markets of the system exist in the period after the EMU.

Those authors identified characteristics that potential members of a monetary union should ideally possess in order to make it feasible to surrender a nationally- tailored monetary policy and the adjustment of an exchange rate of a national currency. We trace the development of optimum currency- area theory, which, after a flurry of research into the subject in the 1960s, was relegated to intellectual purgatory for about 20 years. We then discuss factors that led to a renewed interest into the subject, beginning in the early 1990s. Milton Friedman plays a pivotal role in our narrative; Friedman’s work on monetary integration in the early 1950s presaged subsequent optimum-currency-area contributions; Mundell’s classic formulation of an optimal currency area was aimed, in part, at refuting Friedman’s ‘‘strong’’ case for floating exchange rates; and Friedman’s work on the role of monetary policy had the effect of helping to revive interest in optimum-currency-area analysis. The paper concludes with a discussion of recent analytical work, using New Keynesian models, which has the promise of fulfilling the unfinished agenda set-out by the original contributors to the optimum-currency-area literature, that is, providing a consistent framework in which a country’s characteristics can be used to determine its optimal exchange-rate regime"

The findings provide evidence of value creation in European banks as the shareholders of the targets have benefited from positive and (statistically) significant abnormal returns while those of the acquirers earn small negative but non-significant abnormal returns. In the case of the shareholders of the acquirers, domestic M&As and especially those between banks with shares listed on the stock market, seem to be more beneficial compared to cross-border ones or those when the target is unlisted. Shareholders of the targets earn in all cases positive abnormal returns. Finally, although the link between abnormal returns and fundamental characteristics of the banks is rather weak, it appears that the acquisition of smaller, less efficient banks generating more diversified income are more value creating, while acquisition of less efficient, liquid and characterised by higher credit risk banks is not a value creating option."

We employ panel co-integration to estimate fertility as function of demographic and economic variables. We show that low fertility in most industrialized countries in Europe is due to low infant mortality rates, high female employment, low nuptiality rate and high opportunity cost of having children. Using two measures of economic uncertainty, which are associated with labor market decisions - a production (an output) volatility measure and the unemployment rate - we examine to what extent economic insecurities affect fertility decisions. The empirical results show that both measures of economic uncertainty have a significant negative impact on fertility implying that labor market insecurities might be a significant factor affecting fertility decisions."

Its objective is to spread knowledge on the economic history of the region in the context of European experience with a specific focus on financial, monetary and banking history. The SEEMHN Data Collection Task Force aims at establishing a historical database with 19th and 20th century financial and monetary data for the countries in the region. A set of data has already been published as an annex to the 2007 conference proceedings, released by the OeNB (2008, Workshops, no 13). The second stage of the SEEMHN Data Collection Task force includes reports from all participating central banks. For each country, historical aggregates are preceded by a description of the country’s monetary events and explanatory remarks. The data set refers to banknotes in circulation, reserves, discount rates and exchange rates. The frequency is monthly and the time span covers the period from 1870 and beyond to 1914. A foreword on the paramount importance of historical data series is supplemented by Prof. Michael Bordo (Rutgers University). An introduction on crosscountry historical comparison is written by Dr. Matthias Morys (University of York). Here we present data displays for each country written by Kliti Ceca, Kelmend Rexha and Elsida Orhan for Albania (Banka e Shqiperise); Thomas Scheiber for Austria-Hungary (Oesterreichische Nationalbank); Kalina Dimitrova (Balgarska Narodna Banka) and Martin ivanov (Bulgarian Academy of Science) for Bulgaria; Sopfia Lazaretou for Greece (Bank of Greece); George Virgil Stoenescu, Elisabeta Blejan, Brindusa Costache and Adriana Iarovici Aloman for Romania (Banca Nationala a Romaniei); Milan Sojic, Ljiljana Durdevic, Sanja Borkovic and Olivera Jovanovic for Serbia (Narodna Banka Srbije).

The new method employs the well-known model of Panzar and Rosse (1987) and proposes its estimation using the local regression technique. Thus, a number of restrictive assumptions regarding the properties of the production function of banks are relaxed, while the method proves successful in providing reasonable estimates of bank-level market power when applied to a large panel of banks of transition countries. The empirical results suggest that many banks in the sample deviate significantly from competitive practices and that market power varies substantially across banks in each country. Country averages of the bank-level results exhibit a very close relationship with standard, industry-level Panzar-Rosse estimates."

The results show that bank output and labor productivity increased considerably during the period under examination, outpacing the respective GDP growth and labor productivity of the Greek economy. Capital productivity and TFP of the Greek banking industry have also improved remarkably mainly since 1999, as a result of the structural changes that took place within the industry, capital investments (mainly in IT equipment) as well as improvement in the quality of human capital."

The policymaker who decides to maintain or reform the supervisory architecture is influenced by the existing institutional setting in a systematic way: the more the central bank is actually involved in supervision, the less likely a more concentrated supervisory regime will emerge, and vice versa (path dependence effect). We test the path dependence effect describing and evaluating the evolution and the present state of the architecture of six national supervisory regimes in South Eastern Europe (SEE): Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Serbia and Turkey. The study of the SEE countries confirms the postulated role of the central bank in the institutional setting. In five cases the high involvement of the central bank in supervision is correlated with a multi–authority regime, while in one case a high degree of financial supervision unification is related with low central bank involvement."

To this end, we first study the country’s financial structure and its process of financial development. Several indices of financial development have been assessed and their evolvement has been studied. The country’s financial development had passed through different stages. Financial depth had increased in the turn of the 19th century and expanded further in the 1920s. However, on the basis of behavioural indices, banks were shown to be poorly asset-liability managed. They were also suffered by capital adequacy and were highly leveraged. The analysis of the composition of money supply and its long run behaviour suggests that monetary base variations were the proximate determinants of money supply movements, whereas money multiplier had a minimum impact. Central banking in pre-WWII Greece is viewed with regard to the monetary policy strategy, the monetary policy implementation framework and state interventions. The balance sheet of the Bank of Greece reveals an excessive focus on the chosen monetary policy strategy of a currency peg. Domestic credit was controlled via liquidity-providing standing facilities, either discounts or advances. Moreover, Bank’s considerable involvement in government re-financing might indicate that state interventions were considerable."

One of the common features of the banks in region is certainly the prevailing role of short-term resources and a huge imbalance in interest incomes and incomes from other bank transactions.

In the second part, we discuss different explanations for the widespread collapse of commercial banks after the onset of the Great Depression. Relying on a new data set for over 100 Bulgarian commercial banks, we show that traditional explanations for the collapse of European commercial banks in the 1930s (based on the default of risky loans and falling asset prices due to deflation) need to be complemented by the pernicious effects of widespread insider lending in the Bulgarian case. We conclude that insider lending was the single most important factor behind the demise of the private banking system after the onset of the Depression."

In some cases however, bondholders may legitimately expect to be repaid by more than one agent. For example, when a country breaks-up, successor states may agree to recognize their responsibility for part of the debt. Other extreme events, such as repudiations, may lead (and have led) bondholders to consider several bailout candidates at the same point in time. This paper first discusses the theoretical financial implications stemming from an infrequent and challenging situation, namely the existence of multiple potential payers. Then, through a historical precedent, the 1918 Russian repudiation, the paper confirms that the existence of multiple potential payers has a diversification effect which lowers the volatility of the bond price and increases its value. These results are strengthened by a comparison with a closely related standard case of default."

One of the main implications of the above mentioned Ricardian assumption is that the fiscal policy does not have any distortionary effect for the economy, i.e. it does not affect the behaviour of the households, supporting that way the fiscal policy’s neutrality. The argument for this view comes if one assumes that fiscal policy has a distortionary effect on the behaviour of the agents. We relax the above non distortionary assumption by assuming that the imposition of the taxes is consistent with a transaction cost of the tax system that underlies the state - tax payer interaction. In this way we develop a channel through which the stability of prices carried out by the independent central bank is, within optimality, also a function of the fiscal policy determinants (the transaction cost, the tax rates and the debt level). The analysis is carried out in a framework of a monetary union, with two different countries. Within this framework, the effectiveness of a numerical fiscal rule is also examined."

The literature review suggests that a relative-small group of countries, typically including South Africa, satisfies the criteria necessary for monetary unification. The literature also suggests that, in a monetary union comprised of all SADC countries and a regional central bank that sets monetary policy to reflect the average economic conditions (e.g., fiscal balances) in the region, the potential losses (i.e., higher inflation) from giving up an existing credible national central bank, a relevant consideration for South Africa, could outweigh any potential benefits of trade creation resulting from a common currency."

The sample covers a rather long period of four decades with exports aggregated based on industrial rather than on trade classification. The study contributes to a better understanding of the effects of export prices, domestic and competitors’, as well as of non-price competitiveness approximated with capital stock, on export performance. The empirical estimation uses the Johansen maximum likelihood approach in the long run and a dynamic errorcorrection equation in the short run. The estimated long-run and short-run relationships follow the economic theory and are remarkably stable. It is shown that non-price competitiveness plays a vital role in explaining export performance in the long run as well as in the short run and that failure to include it in the export equation may lead to mis-specification error. As opposed to conventional models of export demand where income effects are very high, in the present study foreign income has a moderately high effect on exports in the long run and no effect in the short run. Exports are also sensitive to domestic and competitors’ prices in the long run, but cost and price competitiveness elasticities are close to one, indicating that Greek exporters have some ability to compete on the basis of prices."

Several methods for modelling such data have been suggested in the literature to cope with these problems. This paper compares the performance of several alternative estimators, including two-part models and generalized linear models. The dependent variable is household, not individual, expenditure on health care in Greece, a country where out-of-pocket health expenditure is higher than anywhere else in the European Union, whether as a proportion of GDP, as a share of all health spending, or in per capita terms. To facilitate comparison of model performance, household health expenditure is examined in two different specifications; expenditure on all health care (where zero values are rare) and expenditure on hospital services alone (where zero values are common). Three of the estimators performed almost equally well in terms of mean square error and mean absolute prediction error; a modified two-part model with non-linear least squares in the second part, a constant-variance generalized linear model, and a varianceproportional- to-mean generalized linear model.

We calculate the effect directly, using sectoral national accounts data, which permits estimation of total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the tradeables and nontradeables sectors. Our results suggest that it is difficult to produce one estimate of the BS effect. Any particular estimate is contingent on the definition of the tradeables sector and the assumptions made about labour shares. Moreover, there is also evidence that the effect has been declining through time as Greek standards of living have caught up on those in the rest of the world and as the non-tradeables sector within Greece catches up with the tradeables."

 """,2007.,Optimal Monetary Policy in the Euro Area in the Presence of Heterogeneity,"62, Bank of Greece.","This paper examines the optimal design of monetary policy in the European monetary union in the presence of structural asymmetries across union member countries. It derives analytically an optimal interest rate rule under commitment and studies the dependence of its coefficients on the parameters of the structural model of each economy, the central bank's preferences for inflation and output stabilization as shown in its loss function, and the relative size of each country. Based on a twocountry, forward-looking, general equilibrium model, which is estimated for two euro area countries (Germany and France), we show that there are gains to be achieved by the ECB taking into account the heterogeneity of economic structures. This finding appears to be robust under alternative weights given by the central bank to the stabilization of the target variables. Although the implementation of the proposed rule involves difficulties relating to data and estimation constraints as well as risks of accommodating structural divergences, it is important that the ECB takes into consideration national characteristics in formulating its monetary policy, especially in view of more countries joining the European monetary union in the future. However, as monetary and financial integration advances, the welfare benefits of monetary policy responding to individual countries' variables may become less significant."

 """,2007.,A Portofolio Balance Approach to Euro-Area Money Demand in a Time-Varying Environment,"61, Bank of Greece.","As part of its monetary policy strategy, the European Central Bank has formulated a reference value for M3 growth. A pre-requisite for the use of a reference value for M3 growth is the existence of a stable demand function for that aggregate. However, a large empirical literature has emerged showing that, beginning in 2001, essentially all euro area M3 demand functions have exhibited instability. This paper considers euroarea money demand in the context of the portfolio-balance framework. Our basic premise is that there is a stable demand-for-money function but that the models that have been used until now to estimate euro area money-demand are not well-specified because they do not include a measure of wealth. Using two empirical methodologies - - a co-integrated vector equilibrium correction (VEC) approach and a time-varying coefficient (TVC) approach - - we find that a demand-for-money function that includes wealth is stable. The upshot of our findings is that M3 behaviour continues to provide useful information about medium-term developments on inflation."

Most empirical estimates of the NKPC, typically based on Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation, have found a significant role for lagged inflation, producing a “hybrid” NKPC. Using U.S. quarterly data, this paper examines whether the role of lagged inflation in the NKPC might be due to the spurious outcome of specification biases. Like previous investigators, we employ GMM estimation and, like those investigators, we find a significant effect for lagged inflation. We also use time varying coefficient (TVC) estimation, a procedure that allows us to directly confront specification biases and spurious relationships. Using three separate measures of expected inflation, we find strong support for the view that, under TVC estimation, the coefficient on expected inflation is near unity and that the role of lagged inflation in the NKPC is spurious."

These include: (a) the synchronization of the business cycle; (b) the degree of factor mobility; and (c) the extent of trade and financial integration. In this paper I analyze the desirability of a monetary union from a Latin American perspective. First, I review the existing literature on the subject. Second, I use a large data set to analyze the evidence on economic performance in currency union countries. I investigate these countries’ performance on four dimensions: (a) whether countries without a national currency have a lower occurrence of “sudden stop” episodes; (b) whether they have a lower occurrence of “current account reversal” episodes; (c) what is their ability to absorb international terms of trade shocks; and (d) what is their ability to absorb “sudden stops” and “current account reversals” shocks. I find that belonging to a currency union does not lower the probability of facing a sudden stop or a current account reversal. I also find that external shocks are amplified in currency union countries. The degree of amplification is particularly large when compared to flexible exchange rate countries."

Outside factors such as systemic shocks and globalization seem to speed up the pooling of sovereignty in the economic domain. A firm commitment to stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policies is a precondition for gaining credibility and trust within and outside a monetary union. Last, but not least, convergence criteria, fiscal rules and strong institutions are necessary to help ensure and monitor the participants’ compliance.

This paper argues that this is a dangerous path in the context of highly integrated financial markets. An alternative approach is proposed where independent central banks coordinate their monetary policies through the adoption of common objectives and by building an appropriate institutional framework. When this coordination process has progressed to the point where interest rate developments are similar across the region, and if in the meantime the required institutional infrastructure has been build, the next step towards monetary unification can be taken among those central banks that so desire. The claim is that this transition path is likely to be robust and will limit the risk of currency crises."

 """,2005.,Measuring Liquidity in the Greek Government Securities Market,"23, Bank of Greece.","Liquidity in government securities markets, despite their importance to both private and public agents, has received much attention in the literature only recently due to the fact that high-frequency data from trading in those markets were previously unavailable. This paper attempts to measure liquidity in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, where Greek government securities are traded, by estimating six different liquidity measures from high-frequency data. The most appropriate measures for this specific market are derived from the analysis and comparison of the obtained estimates. By any of the measures examined, the ten-year benchmark bond is the most liquid security. The bid-ask spread emerges as a good measure of liquidity for the pre euro area entry period, but looses part of its importance in the post euro area entry period of our sample. An interesting finding is that, in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, liquidity is only weakly related to price volatility, probably due to the specific structure of the government securities market in Greece. Therefore, trading activity is also found to be a good proxy of liquidity in this specific market."

 """,2005.,"Market Power, Innovative Activity and Exchange Rate Pass-Through","22, Bank of Greece.","This paper considers an international oligopoly where firms simultaneously choose both the amount of output produced and the proportion of R&D investment to output. The model captures the links between the exchange rate, market power, innovative activity and price, which are important for the determination of the optimal degree of exchange rate pass-through. It is found that in the long run the pass-through elasticity can be less than, equal to or greater than one depending on R&D effectiveness but in any case it is higher than in models that do not endogenise innovation decisions. The empirical implications of the model are tested using data for Japanese firms exporting to the US market and applying the Johansen multivariate cointegration technique. Particular attention is given to the estimation and identification of the equilibrium price and R&D-intensity equations. The empirical results indicate that price-setting and R&D-intensity decisions of firms are jointly determined in the long run. This interdependence must be taken into account if an accurate estimate of the exchange rate pass-through is to be obtained."

A Cross-Country Analysis,"21, Bank of Greece.","The role of corporations in allocating resources has been of great importance in the debate about the manner in which enterprises should be governed to enhance economic growth. Corporate governance features seem to be central to the dynamics by which successful firms and economies improve their performance over time as well as relative to each other. In this paper we try to clarify the relationship between corporate ownership structure and output growth by using the data of La Porta et al. (1999) on ownership structure of large- and medium-sized corporations in 27 wealthy economies. To search for empirical linkages, we use cross-country growth regressions. The evidence provided in the paper suggests that an environment with a higher percentage of directly and indirectly widely-held companies and a lower degree of state than private ownership is associated with a higher growth rate of per capita income. We also conclude that a higher degree of institutional investment does not seem to enhance the growth performance of an economy."

The model has been developed as part of a larger project within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), the Multi-Country Model (MCM). The model combines short-run Keynesian dynamics determined by demand with a neoclassical steady state driven by supply factors. A well-specified long-run supply side is fully and simultaneously estimated. As far as the econometric methodology is concerned, the equilibrium relationships are estimated using cointegration analysis, whereas the dynamic equations are specified as error correction models. Standard simulations result in plausible short to long-run responses to exogenous shocks, thus indicating that the model can be useful for policy analysis experiments."

The novelty of the paper is that the validity of the PPP conditions relating the economies of the US, Germany and Japan is tested in a system framework, which allows for possible interactions in the determination of the exchange rates and the prices of the three economies. Some form of causality among the variables of the system is also assessed empirically with the aid of weak exogeneity tests. The results illustrate the importance of the multilateral testing. Positive evidence for PPP is found: long-run PPP is supported for the US and Germany but also for the US and Japan, in contrast to evidence of earlier empirical studies. In addition, causality is found running from the US prices to the exchange rates and German and Japanese prices."

The concept of the optimum currency area turns out to play an important role. The formation of a regional regime tends to decrease global volatility when countries are symmetric. The effects tend to be ambiguous in the case of asymmetries. The reduction in global volatility is larger when the rest of the world has more rigid labor markets than the peggers. When the exchange rate management is done mostly by countries with relatively more flexible labor markets. And in the presence of a negative correlation in productivity shocks across countries."

Furthermore, the contribution of stock market finance to economic growth appears to be substantially smaller compared to bank finance."

Seen from this perspective, adherence to the specie convertibility rule enables peripheral countries to establish credibility of the nation’s economic policy and, thus, to obtain access to the core countries’ capital markets. The evidence assembled in the paper, both historical and empirical, supports the conclusion that Greece seems to have tried very hard to adhere to “good housekeeping rules”."

This tends to bias tests of long-run PPP against its acceptance. The validity of the theoretical arguments is assessed by drawing on the experience of two European Union countries, Greece and France for the post-Bretton Woods period. Estimation biases due to the omission of policy effects are found to be significant only in the case of Greece. For France, our test results provide evidence bearing on the effectiveness of the competitive disinflation strategy pursued by the French authorities."

Three empirical methodologies, univariate autoregressive (AR) modelling, second-generation random coefficient (RC) modelling, and vector autoregressive (VAR) modelling, are employed to estimate inflation persistence. The empirical results from all the procedures suggest that inflation persistence was high during the inflationary period and the first six years of the disinflationary period, while it started to decline after 1997, when inflationary expectations seem to have been stabilised, and thus, monetary policy was effective at reducing inflation. Empirical findings also detect a sluggish response of inflation to changes in monetary policy. This observed delay seems to have changed little over time."

Unlike the traditional OCA literature, we find that countries with a high degree of nominal wage rigidity benefit from monetary union, specially when they join other, similarly rigid countries. Countries with relatively more flexible wages tend to be worse off in unions with countries that have more rigid wages. We examine France, Germany and the UK and find that the welfare implications of alternative monetary arrangements depend more on the degree of wage asymmetry than on other types of asymmetries (in shocks, monetary policy etc.). And that, higher degree of wage flexibility in the UK relative to France and Germany would make its participation in EMU costly."

We show that augmenting a standard VAR with a small number of variables that have forward-looking informational content is capable of producing theory-consistent responses to monetary policy shocks. The VAR is estimated for the US with data covering the period 1989-2001, which is characterized by a relatively homogeneous monetary policy regime and a pronounced price puzzle in standard VAR specifications. Most important among these forward-looking variables are the federal funds rate future reflecting expectations of future monetary policy and a leading composite indicator providing information about near-term developments in economic activity. In view of the increasing ability of financial markets to better predict monetary policy movements, financial asset prices, such as the federal funds rate futures, are ideal candidates for incorporating parsimoniously a large amount of information into a lowdimension VAR."

These reforms were supposed to provide an opportunity to Greek banks to improve their efficiency and to enhance their competitiveness in view of ongoing financial integration in Europe and the introduction of the euro. The results obtained indicate that important cost X-inefficiencies are in place. Some evidence is provided that bank characteristics such as bank size, type of ownership and risk behaviour do play a role in explaining differences in measured inefficiencies. Scale economies are also examined and the findings indicate that the Greek banking industry experiences economies of scale, though they have declined throughout the observed period. This suggests that competitive viability may be an important factor for further consolidation in the Greek banking industry."

The net result of this trading activity, which is unrelated to economic fundamentals, can be to push interest rates further in the direction they were moving. Such “feedback” effects interfere with the short-term dynamics of interest rate movements and can alter the shape of the yield curve, especially when changes in interest rates are large. Our empirical results confirm the existence of a positive feedback from the activity in the euro-denominated interest rate options market to the european yield curve. This finding can be useful for risk management purposes but also for analysts and policy makers when interpreting short-run movements in the yield curve as signals of future economic activity."

In this work, the consequences of neglecting variance non-stationarity in economic time series, and the conceptual difference between variance non-stationarity and conditional variance are discussed. An ad hoc method for testing and correcting for variance non-stationarity is suggested. It is shown that the presence of variance non-stationarity leads to misspecified univariate ARIMA models and correcting for it, the number of model parameters is vastly reduced. The implications of the tests for the hypothesis of weak form market efficiency (WFME) are discussed. More specifically it is argued that the usual autocorrelation tests are inappropriate when based on the differences of asset prices. Finally, it is shown how the analysis of outliers is affected by the presence of variance non-stationarity."

We show that they have been experiencing fairly sizeable capital flows since the early 1990s. We explain these flows using two separate models. The first explains the level of capital flows using panel data from the prospective EU members. The second concentrates specifically on estimating the probability of a country experiencing downward speculative pressure. In both cases, the contribution of domestic factors and contagion is explored. The results suggest that while domestic factors have some role to play, it is rather limited. Moreover there is clear evidence of contagion effects, suggesting that macroeconomic policy in the prospective EU members will be complicated by capital flows in the run up to euro area membership."

The other three European countries examined – Germany, France, Italy – are in between, with the lending channel losing its potency in the last decade."

For Greece and for the drachma, the lessons from the past are very important. Since the formation of the modern Greek State, government officials have striven – sometimes making hard efforts – to keep abreast of international monetary developments. This was because they understood that the participation of a peripheral, poor and inflation-prone country with a weak currency and an underdeveloped money market, like Greece of the time, in a monetary club of powerful economies could dramatically improve her international credit standing and imply important benefits in terms of exchange rate and monetary stability, and long-term foreign borrowing."

Two empirical methodologies, vector error correction (VEC) modelling and second-generation random coefficient (RC) modelling, are used to estimate the demand for money. The coefficients of both the VEC and RC procedures support the hypothesis that the demand for money becomes more responsive to both the own rate of return on money balances and the opportunity cost of holding money because of financial deregulation. In general, both procedures also support the hypothesis that the income elasticity of money demand declines over time as a result of technological improvements in the payments system and the development of money substitutes, which lead to economies of scale in holding money."
