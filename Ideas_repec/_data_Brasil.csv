 """,2025.,The Not So Quiet Revolution: signal and noise in central bank communication,"635, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper quantifies the “prediction value” of different forms of central bank communication. Combining traditional econometrics and natural language processing, we test how much forecast-improving information can be extracted from the different layers of the Federal Reserve communication. We find that committee-wise communication (statements and minutes) and speeches by the Chair and the Vice Chair improve interest rate forecasts, suggesting that they provide additional information to understand the policy reaction function. However, individual communication beyond the Vice Chair, such as speeches by board members, other FOMC members, and Federal Reserve Bank presidents not sitting in FOMC, is not forecast improving and sometimes even worsens interest-rate forecasts. Based on our theoretical model, we interpret these results as suggesting that the Fed may have overcommunicated, providing excessive noise-inducing communication for forecasting purposes."

 """,2025.,"Liquidity or Wealth? Consumption, Debt, and Financial Fragility After a Windfall","634, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper examines how individual consumers adjust consumption and debt in response to a large, exogenous financial windfall, using Brazil’s 2017 FGTS reform, which allowed early access to previously illiquid severance fund balances. Leveraging rich administrative data linking credit registry and labor records, we use a difference-in-differences design exploiting quasi-exogenous eligibility timing based on birth month. We decompose the shock into liquidity and wealth components: the liquidity channel reflects early access to illiquid savings, while the wealth component arises from the present-value gain due to FGTS yields being persistently below market interest rates. Credit-constrained individuals primarily used the funds to reduce debt and lower default risk, while unconstrained consumers increased credit-financed spending, raising financial fragility. Liquidity components drove deleveraging and stability, whereas wealth components led to durable consumption and greater credit exposure. These results provide rare empirical validation of key Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) mechanisms and offer policy-relevant insights into how the composition of financial transfers influences consumer behavior and financial stability."

 """,2025.,The Impact of Climate Transition Risks on the Brazilian Financial Sector,"633, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","In this paper, we propose a methodology for computing the impact of climate transition risks on the financial system. The novelty of our analytical approach is that it accounts for indirect impacts stemming from inter-sectoral linkages (on the real sector side) and interbank loans (on the financial sector side). Our proposed methodology is carried out in three sequential steps: physical capital stranding due to a shock on a carbon-intensive economic sector (the mining fossil sector), potential direct losses experienced by the financial sector caused by its loan exposures to the real sector, and indirect potential losses due to interbank exposures. Applying this methodology to a rich Brazilian financial dataset alongside with reputable international input-output databases, we show that (i) the sectors with the highest rates of stranding physical capital vary with the model used to compute such stranding, (ii) the distribution of the individual direct and indirect losses are well-fitted by a power law, and (iii) the aggregate potential loss, both direct and indirect, declined during the period assessed in this study (2015-2022)."

 """,2025.,Competing for Loan Informal Seniority: Theory and Evidence,"632, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","Using data on the universe of retail loans in Brazil, we show that universal de[1]fault is rare: when borrowers are in distress, they often repay one of their credit cards. Using a novel identification strategy, we estimate the causal impact of getting a new credit card on default. We also document that borrowers prioritize repaying the cards with higher limits, originated by fintech companies, or by lenders that also sold them other financial products. Motivated by these facts, we introduce the concept of informal seniority and develop a model of non-exclusive lending in which lenders compete for repayment priority using contract terms. Competition for loan seniority creates a debt-dilution problem; as a result, bankruptcy laws mandating equal recovery rates across all unsecured loans can reduce welfare."

 """,2025.,R&D Subsidy and Import Substitution: growing in the shadow of protection,"631, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","We study the effect of an innovation subsidy on the long-run growth of firms in a developing country. Using administrative microdata from Brazil and a quasi-experimental design that compares near-winners to near-losers of R&D subsidy applications, we find that the program had a persistent effect on firm size: fourteen years after receiving the subsidy, subsidized firms were 59% larger. The effect is strongest among small and young firms facing high borrowing costs, which is consistent with the subsidy alleviating financial constraints. This growth, however, did not come from firms developing frontier innovations. Instead, firms used the subsidy to expand their product lines into high-tariff markets, producing local versions of foreign goods."

 """,2025.,When Low Rates Speak Loud: exchange rate dynamics under different interest rate regimes,"630, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper examines the relationship between interest rate differentials and exchange rate returns across different monetary regimes, with a particular focus on distinguishing between high- and low-interest-rate setups. Relying on a rich panel dataset comprising 46 countries and over two decades of monthly observations, we estimate panel models that allow for country-specific heterogeneity and regime-dependent dynamics. Thresholds separating regimes are constructed in a fully data-driven manner, including conditional and time-varying specifications. Our findings show that exchange rate elasticity with respect to interest rate differentials indeed depends on the regime and it is usually higher under low interest rates, a result consistent across several model specifications and robustness checks. A clustering analysis is also conducted to uncover groups of countries with similar FX dynamics, further highlighting the heterogeneous nature of currency responses across the international landscape."

 """,2025.,Macroeconomic Drivers of Brazil's Yield Curve,"629, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper investigates how the Brazilian yield curve has responded to macroeconomic fundamentals over the past two decades. Using a set of OLS regressions applied to short- and long-term interest rates, as well as the yield curve slope, we examine the roles of domestic inflation, fiscal stance, economic activity, and external interest rates. Our findings show that domestic inflation and economic activity, together with U.S. yields, exhibit consistent significance across maturities. Fiscal indicators based on primary surplus, rather than public debt, exert a clear effect on short-term rates and the slope, underscoring the relevance of fiscal flows over fiscal levels. Robustness exercises incorporating financial conditions, credit indicators, and the monetary policy stance confirm that short-term rates are especially responsive to financial signals and regime changes, whereas long-term rates are more strongly influenced by external conditions, credit dynamics, and a persistent monetary stance. The analysis is further extended to real interest rates, confirming the robustness of the main results and highlighting the enduring influence of fiscal flows and credit dynamics on the slope and long-term rates. These findings show the importance of credible fiscal and monetary frameworks and provide new evidence on how emerging market yield curves reflect domestic and external fundamentals."

 """,2025.,Volatility and Under-Insurance in Economies with Limited Pledgeability: evidence from a frost shock,"628, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","We use transaction-level data on payments, credit, and insurance to examine how Brazilian farmers responded to the severe frost of July 2021, a shock that affected coffee, a perennial crop whose plants are a major component of farm value. The frost shock reduced both output and the pledgeable value of farmers’ collateral. We find that insured farmers increased investment in the years following the shock, while uninsured farmers reduced investment and borrowing. We show how this pattern is consistent with models of imperfect pledgeability of a firm’s collateral, where constrained firms neither insure (ex-ante) nor fully recover from a shock (ex-post). Limited commitment endogenously generates under-insurance through the combination of upfront payment of the insurance premium with the tightening of borrowing constraints post-shock due to the decrease in total collateral. We discuss two equilibrium implications of this mechanism: the inefficacy of emergency credit lines in targeting liquidity-constrained firms and the amplification of output volatility from the rising risk of extreme weather shocks."

 """,2025.,Gender Gap among Microentrepreneurs in Brazil,"627, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper estimates the gender revenue gap among Brazilian microentrepreneurs, sheds a light on the factors behind these disparities, and compares it with the formal job market. We collect payment data from all individual microentrepreneur businesses that remained open throughout the entire year of 2023, and from the owners of the businesses. The empirical approach consists of cross-section regressions comparing this revenue estimate for men and women, controlling for a set of variables, like geographic location and economic activity. Our results indicate that women microentrepreneurs have revenues 31% lower than those of men without any control. When controlling for economic activity, this gap decreases to 23%, so occupation choices account for a quarter of the original gender gap. Other controls like microentrepreneur’s age, firm’s age, and geographical location do not materially change this estimate. Prior formal job experience decreases the gender gap by 7 percentage points. We also estimate a 10% wage gender gap for the formal job market in 2023, which is 1/3 of the microentrepreneurs’ revenue gender gap."

 """,2025.,"Labor Turnover, Information Production, and Bank Risk","626, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","We investigate the theoretical mechanisms through which labor turnover adversely affects bank risk and performance. Using monthly matched employer-employee data from Brazil during 2003-2019, we find banks with higher labor turnover show lower risk buffers, higher loan growth, and lower profitability. These adverse effects align with the firm-specific human capital theory. Consistent with our identifying assumptions, the effects are stronger when turnover reduces experience and expertise, among loan officers, as well as across cities and banks. Placebo tests and further analyses confirm our results. The evidence suggests that high labor turnover impairs bank information production, increasing risk and lowering performance."

 """,2025.,Do Inflation-Linked Bonds Predict Future Inflation? a reassessment using novel methodologies and instruments,"625, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This study revisits the question ""Do inflation-linked bonds contain information about future inflation?"" posed by Vicente and Guillen (2013), by addressing two critical issues related to the breakeven inflation rate (BEIR) that were not considered by the authors: the inflation lag embedded in inflation-indexed securities and the seasonality inherent in inflation indices. The analysis evaluates three methods for calculating the BEIR for the purpose of forecasting inflation: the one used by Vicente and Guillen (2013), which we refer to as Naïve BEIR; an alternative measure derived from government bonds but incorporating corrections for inflation lag and seasonality (Bond Market BEIR, BM-BEIR); and a BEIR based on the Futures Market (Futures Market BEIR, FM-BEIR), which also includes these adjustments. The results show that BM-BEIR significantly outperforms Naive BEIR for short-term horizons (3 and 6 months), closely tracking actual inflation. Moreover, both BM-BEIR and FM-BEIR match the predictive accuracy of survey expectations, while offering the advantage of frequent updates - highlighting their utility for short-term inflation forecasting and decision-making."

 """,2025.,Private Credit Bureaus and Positive Information Sharing: Effects on credit cost?,"624, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This study exploits a legal change in Brazil to identify the extent to which new information generated by credit bureaus translates into different loan interest rates. The legal change enabled private credit bureaus (PCBs) to build new credit scores for approximately 100 million individuals, based on a broader scope of positive information, such as loan flow and repayment patterns. We find an average reduction of 3.7% in the interest rates of personal loans to borrowers whose new scores became available for sale by the PCBs. The effects are stronger in the cases where the new score is much higher than the old score, reaching an average reduction of 8.7%. We find stronger results for new clients and for private banks. The mechanisms behind our results include both the reassessment of borrower credit risk and higher competition among lenders coming from the dissemination of new positive information. We also provide empirical evidence consistent with information sharing reducing the ability of lenders to informationally lock-in their borrowers."

 """,2025.,Optimal Inflation Targeting,"623, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper examines optimal inflation targeting, determining the best inflation target and policy response using a DSGE model with adaptive price-setting firms, in the form of a hybrid Phillips Curve. The results indicate a zero inflation target maximizes household welfare, as higher inflation increases volatility and economic inefficiency. As inflation targets rise, monetary policy must respond more aggressively to shocks and deviations from the target. Notably, the optimal policy does not react to output gaps. These findings highlight the importance of credible and well-structured monetary policies in ensuring macroeconomic stability and the growing costs of inflation (in terms of households’ welfare)."

 """,2025.,Enforcing Compliance with Labor Regulations and Firm Outcomes: evidence from Brazil,"622, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","We study the impacts of enforcing compliance with labor regulations on firm dynamics by combining firm-level administrative records and labor inspection data on formal Brazilian establishments committing “unregistered employee” infractions. We first provide suggestive evidence that inspected firms employing informal workers are more likely to exit following a labor inspection, compared to firms never penalized for such infractions. Next, we apply a difference-in-differences framework using firms not yet penalized for “unregistered employee” infractions as the control group to estimate the effect of labor inspections on firm-level outcomes. We find that formal employment and formal labor hiring experience a positive spike in the year of the inspection, indicating the formalization of unregistered employees. However, formal employment declines steadily over time, dropping nearly 60% by the fourth year after inspection. Among firms with active bank relationships, revenue falls sharply by about 24% over the same period. We also observe a persistent reduction in the outstanding loan amount and significant rise in the non-performing loan ratio. The average formal wage drops by about 1% in the year of inspection, but returns to pre-inspection levels in later years. Our findings are consistent with firms reducing their overall labor usage due to higher labor costs, which arise from increased compliance with labor regulations following a labor inspection."

 """,2025.,Escaping Death: individual mobility and female mortality,"621, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","We document that access to individual mobility reduces female mortality using random variation from motorcycle credit lotteries involving about one million individuals. The strongest determinant of reduced female mortality is fewer fatal assaults in public spaces, suggesting mobility enables women to avoid dangerous environments. Access to individual mobility also reduces fatal domestic violence exposure and facilitates transitions from high-mortality risk occupations. For men, motorcycle access yields no net mortality effect; health improvements are offset by increased motorcycle accident fatalities. Back-ofthe-envelope calculations suggest that the benefits of reduced mortality offset the cost of investing in a motorcycle for women."

 """,2025.,The Determinant Factors of Hedging and Speculation with Foreign Exchange Derivatives of Brazilian Private Firms,"620, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper examines the determinant factors of hedging and speculation with foreign exchange derivatives of Brazilian private firms. I build an original database of 211,746 contracts of plain vanilla derivatives of foreign exchange from 2010 to 2020 of these firms. From these contracts, I identify that the most relevant factor that affects positively hedging is foreign exchange exposure, while profitability and growth opportunities are the most relevant factors that negatively affect speculation. I also observe that more private firms speculated than hedged in our sample period. The results are statistically significant and robust to different specifications and econometric techniques, such as those that deal with endogeneity of regressors and measurement errors of binary dependent variables."

 """,2025.,The Effect of Instant Payments on the Banking System,"619, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","Instant payment systems have received considerable attention because of their integration with the banking system and their shared functionalities with CBDCs. We show that instant payments may have the unintended consequences of increasing the banking sector’s demand for liquidity. Using administrative banking data and transaction-level payment data from Brazil’s Pix, one of the most widely adopted instant payment systems, we find that banks increased their liquid asset holdings after the adoption of instant payments. We establish the causal relationship by constructing a novel instrument based on passive payment timeouts. These findings arise because the convenience of instant payments to consumers comes at the expense of banks’ ability to delay and net payment flows. The inability to delay payments increases banks’ demand for holding liquid assets over transforming illiquid ones. Our findings bear important financial stability implications in light of the global surge in adopting instant payment systems, e.g., FedNow in the US."

Leveraging the random assignment of judges to cases brought against financial institutions, we demonstrate banks restrict credit after observing unfavorable decisions issued by pro-debtor judges in disputes involving them. This informational shock is transmitted to firms within banks’ relationships through credit rationing for small businesses, adversely affecting their performance. Our research highlights the significant role of judges in shaping economic activity beyond the immediate parties involved in a legal conflict."

 """,2025.,The Disciplining Effect of Bank Supervision: evidence from SupTech,"617, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","Regulators increasingly rely on supervisory technologies (SupTech) to enhance bank supervision, but their potential role in disciplining bank behavior remains unclear. We address this knowledge gap using unique data from the SupTech application of the Central Bank of Brazil. We show that, after a SupTech event, banks reveal inconsistencies in their risk reporting and tighten credit to less creditworthy firms, effectively reducing risk-taking. This credit tightening in turn has small spillovers on less creditworthy firms borrowing from affected banks. Our results can be explained by a moral suasion channel, offering novel insights into the role of SupTech in bank supervision."

This paper investigates the impact of household debt levels and composition at the time of mass layoffs on job search duration and post-reemploymentwage growth. Using a comprehensive dataset that links personal debt to the employment histories of all formal workers in Brazil, we find that both the level and type of debt significantly shape job search behavior. In line with the theory of debt overhang, workers with high levels of non-collateralized, wage-linked debt are less likely to find new employment but secure higher wages upon reemployment. In contrast, the negative effects areweaker forworkers with collateralized mortgage debt. Overall, our findings underscore the critical role of personal debt structure in shaping labor market dynamics."

 """,2025.,"How Does Central Bank Independence Influence the Relationship Between Inflation, Income Inequality and Poverty?","615, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This study employs panel data analysis for 46 countries from 1980 to 2022 to investigate the impact of inflation on income inequality and poverty, highlighting the mitigating role of central bank independence. Using a comprehensive index of de jure central bank independence, the study assesses its influence on five measures of income inequality, four measures of poverty, and income deciles. The findings suggest structural factors are the main drivers of income inequality and poverty, rather than central bank independence. However, while inflation worsens these issues, central bank independence can counteract the adverse effects of inflation. Moreover, the evidence indicates greater central bank independence disproportionately benefits low-income households at the expense of high-income households, with these redistributive effects being more pronounced at higher levels of independence. In conclusion, central bank independence is pivotal in alleviating the negative impacts of inflationary shocks on income inequality and poverty, thereby promoting social and economic justice."

 """,2025.,"Consumer Loans, Heterogeneous Interest Rates, and Inequality","614, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","Consumer loans are key for consumption smoothing. But what if individuals who need them the most find it harder to access these loans? We examine this question empirically and quantitatively, using Brazilian credit registry and matched employer-employee data. Low-income individuals face higher interest rates, even after controlling for several risk factors and characteristics. Our model includes life-cycle dynamics, different credit types, occupations, and income shocks with endogenous default. According to the calibrated model, reforms reducing loan interest rate spreads could significantly benefit individuals, especially young and poor informal workers. The pro-competition 2013 Loan Portability reform increased welfare by 0.2% of annual consumption."

 """,2025.,Weathering the Storm: how supply chains adapt to extreme climate events,"613, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper examines the causal impact of extreme climate events—intense rains, floods, and flash floods—on the supply chain. We map the Brazilian supply network in a unique and comprehensive way using proprietary granular data on over 1.7 billion inter-firm payments composed of fast payments (Pix), boletos (invoices), and wire transfers (TEDs). Our analysis reveals that supply shocks follow extreme climate events, with outside-the-affected-area customers reducing payments to affected suppliers by up to 8% in the immediate aftermath, compared to unaffected ones within the same industry. We document significant heterogeneities across sectors, with some affected suppliers in agriculture experiencing reductions in payments nearing 20%, five times greater than the average. Leveraging granular data on borrower-lender credit relationships from banking institutions in Brazil, we find affected firms experience increased indebtedness post-disaster, especially in credit types related to immediate liquidity needs. We observe a remarkable ability of the supply chain to adapt to these shocks: outsidethe- affected-area firms are often able to replace affected partners with low friction. However, some sectors, such as construction, face substantial difficulties. In this industry, consumers exhibit a substitution friction of approximately 10 p.p. This demonstrates how indirect effects can amplify the direct impacts of extreme climate events on the supply chain. While overall resilience is crucial for maintaining operability, directly affected firms are likely to experience a permanent loss of market share as unaffected firm counterparts shift their economic transactions away from them, leading to harmful consequences in areas affected by extreme climate events. Our research may support policymakers in designing strategies to aid affected firms in restoring market share and mitigating frictions in sectors less prone to partner replacement."

 """,2024.,Housing and Fertility,"612, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper examines the impact of access to housing on fertility rates using random variation from housing credit lotteries in Brazil. We find that obtaining housing increases the average probability of having a child by 3.8% and the number of children by 3.2%. For 20-25-year-olds, the corresponding effects are 32% and 33%, with no increase in fertility for people above age 40. The lifetime fertility increase for a 20-year old is twice as large from obtaining housing immediately relative to obtaining it at age 30. The increase in fertility is stronger for households in areas with lower quality housing, greater rental expenses relative to income, and those with lower household income and lower female income share. These results suggest that alleviating housing credit and physical space constraints can significantly increase fertility."

 """,2024.,Firm-Level and Aggregate Effects of Cheaper Liquidity: evidence from factoring,"611, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","We show firms experience large contemporaneous increases in sales and purchases after receiving cheaper liquidity. We focus on factoring, defined as the supplier-initiated sale of receivables. In Brazil, receivables funds (FIDCs) securitize receivables for institutional investors. By assembling a novel transaction-level dataset of factoring with other credit operations for all registered firms and FIDCs, we construct a shift-share instrument for the supply of factoring financing based on FIDC flows. We then use a novel combination of electronic payments, trade credit, and employer-employee matched data to estimate the impacts. A flow-induced increase in receivables demand reduces firms’ factoring interest rate. In response, firms demand more permanent labor and less temporary labor. In our model, these effects arise from factoring’s purpose of reducing cash inflow volatility, helping firms match inflows to outflows, which firms otherwise achieve at an efficiency cost through substitution across labor types. Using our model, we estimate an aggregate decrease in the economy-wide factoring spread of 1 percentage point leads to 0.3 to 0.5 percentage point increases in aggregate output and wages."

We demonstrate that SCCs mitigate adverse selection and can outperform traditional loan contracts amidst information frictions, thereby expanding access to credit. Empirical evidence from a financial product incorporating an SCC design supports our theory. While appearing riskier on observables, we observe lower realized default rates for product participants than for bank borrowers. Further consistent with the theory, a reform that reduces the default penalty during the savings period induces worse selection and higher realized default rates."

The model primarily relies on macroeconomic data for calibration, allowing us to decompose Brazil's national TFP into technology and allocative efficiency components from 2000 to 2019. Over these two decades, we observe an upward trend in allocative efficiency, reflecting an increase in the labor income share and a corresponding decrease in the average markup, in sharp contrast with most developed countries. Our results further indicate that the cycles in Brazilian TFP are largely driven by allocative efficiency, with the mid-2000s economic boom mainly attributed to efficiency gains. In contrast, the technology component grows more steadily, around 0.9% per year, suggesting it reflects structural characteristics of the economy. Since allocative efficiency is bounded, this 0.9% annual growth rate can be interpreted as the current long-run growth level of TFP in Brazil."

Our consumption inequality measure is correlated with income inequality calculated using census data, and it exhibits similar regional behavior, although it indicates higher inequality on average, given the nature of the data used. As an application, we assess the relationship between our inequality measure and the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) at the municipal level. We find a negative relationship, indicating that higher economic complexity is associated with lower consumption inequality. Additionally, the relationship is non-linear: with increasing ECI, the influence on consumption inequality becomes more significant."

We explore differential bank exposure to RRs in matched bank-firm loan-level data from Brazil, where RRs have been used extensively to pursue financial stability. We find that, after tightening RRs, more exposed banks reduce credit to firms; after loosening, they expand credit supply. During booms, private domestic banks with lower capital adequacy are more responsive to a tightening of RRs and to a simultaneous tightening of the short-term policy rate. We also find that higher levels of economic policy uncertainty weaken this channel, and real effects in employment are modest"

 """,2024.,Smoothing the New-Keynesian Capital Puzzle,"606, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","Rupert and Šustek (2019) showed that introducing endogenous capital into the canonical New-Keynesian model allows real interest rates to move in any direction after a positive monetary shock. According to them, this would prove that the real interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission is only observational — not structural — in that class of models, and therefore subject to the Lucas (1976) critique. In this paper, I show that such an identification problem for dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and vector autoregression (VAR) models can be circumvented by incorporating interest-rate smoothing — a feature as prevalent in medium-scale New-Keynesian models as capital itself — into the Taylor rule. I find that the negative association between changes in inflation and changes in the real interest rate is actually more robust than that between the former and changes in the nominal interest rate."

 """,2024.,Network Analysis of Exchange Rate Shocks: implications for financial stability in Brazil,"605, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper uses a network-based framework to examine the propagation of exchange rate shocks through the economy. We use a comprehensive set of supervisory, granular, and unique datasets from Brazil to construct an economy-wide network of exposures from 2015 to 2022, which includes a representative set of financial institutions, both banking and nonbanking, the corporate sector, and bilateral exposure linkages encompassing credit and funding risks. Our findings reveal significant disparities in how exchange rate shocks impact different sectors. Financial institutions generally benefit from positive exchange rate shocks due to their net foreign-denominated assets, whereas nonfinancial firms incur losses, particularly those with substantial foreign debt. However, contagion effects indicate that even sectors that are initially better off can experience substantial indirect losses, highlighting the complexity of risks in the financial network. Despite vulnerabilities in segments such as development banks and non-bank financial institutions, adequate regulatory capital maintains and supports overall financial stability. These insights underscore the importance of incorporating network structures in regulatory frameworks and stress-testing methodologies, offering crucial implications for policymakers seeking to improve financial stability and mitigate systemic risks."

The following expectations from the Focus Report (a bulletin released by the Central Bank of Brazil) were analyzed: GDP, policy interest rate, exchange rate and CPI. The interest rates considered are those negotiated in interest rate futures market. The change in interest rate is calculated by comparing the rates before and after the publication of the Focus Report. However, the expectations published in this document are generated in the period prior to the calculation of these interest rate changes. Therefore, if expectations generated earlier (but not disclosed) impact interest rate variations, it indicates that these expectations were not yet embedded in the rates. The results indicate that changes in expectations for GDP, policy interest rate, and CPI (all except the exchange rate) affect the interest rates. This finding underscores the importance of survey expectations in determining financial market prices."

Utilizing this decomposition, we revisit key facts of economic growth. On the one hand, we evaluate the world income frontier as proxied by the US,finding that changes in misallocation can significantly impact short-run growth. On the other hand, we examine the economic performance around the world. We conclude misallocation enhances our understanding of cross-country income differences, eventhough a substantial unexplained portion persists. We also find a lack of convergence in allocative efficiency, suggesting market-power-driven misallocation is linked, in the long run, to long-lasting country-specific factors such as institutions."

Using the different timing and severity of COVID-19 across Brazilian municipalities and identified bank branch credit operations, we construct a branch-specific measure of COVID-19 exposure. Our findings reveal a notable credit reallocation in Brazil during the first year of the pandemic: inland branches more affected by COVID-19 significantly reduced credit to capital-based borrowers while increasing lending to inland clients, driven by heightened risk perceptions of capital-based borrowers. This shift was particularly evident among less liquid and public banks and in regions with more diversified local credit markets. The reallocation was primarily driven by personal loans, indicating that government stimulus measures effectively sustained credit flow to firms despite higher borrowing costs. Our study provides critical insights into the heterogeneous effects of the pandemic on credit markets, highlighting the importance of bank characteristics and regulatory interventions in ensuring financial stability during crises."

Using a local difference-in-differences approach, we find strikingly different results depending on firms’ size. For mid-large firms, despite an increase in subsidy intake of almost 90%, there were no relevant effects on employment or debt, suggesting they mostly used new loans to replace older (more expensive) debt. For smaller firms, we observed a similar increase in the dosage of subsidies, but we also saw an increase in earmarked debt (roughly 75%) and employment (around 6% in the number of employees and 10% in the payroll). However, all labor-related effects were short-lived and vanished after two years. A cost-effectiveness analysis for a two-year window shows that monthly credit subsidies were higher than the increase in the affected firm’s monthly payroll by BRL 393 for micro and small firms and by BRL 165,685 for mid-large firms."

As firms redirected their connections away from heavily impacted urban centers toward inland cities, a more intricate and geographically dispersed network emerged, characterized by less negative assortativity, increased density, and reduced inequality among municipalities. The diversification allowed firms to mitigate the pandemic's effects, underscoring the adaptability and potential soundness of a more decentralized supply chain structure.

In our data set, banks and firms are connected through two financial networks: the interbank network and the bank-firm loan network. We found at least 18% of the edges are critical, in the sense they have a significant impact on the systemic risk of the network. We then employed machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the critical status and – for a large level of the initial shock – the sign of the impact of bank-firm edges on the systemic risk. The level of accuracy obtained in these prediction exercises was very high (above 90%).

This paper develops a DSGE model that features renewable energy production, stochastic growth, and external habit formation to tackle this issue. The model is estimated by Bayesian techniques for Brazil, a large country highly dependent on renewable sources with an energy matrix that may soon reflect other countries' matrices. We assess historical decompositions of energy supply and demand shocks, address measurement errors due to regulated energy prices, account for the sharp increase in volatility during the pandemic period, compute structural impulse response functions, and calculate price-elasticities of energy demand. Energy supply shocks are the major driving force of energy prices. Output growth variations are mostly explained by non-energy shocks. Nevertheless, energy shocks account for 4.6% of its fluctuations, decomposed in 2% to energy-price (supply) shocks and 1.3% to each residential and industrial consumption (demand) shocks. Price-elasticities for residential energy usage are -0.150%, -0.364%, and -0.459% after one, ve, and ten years, respectively. Accordingly, price increases would have a limited impact to refrain energy consumption in times of climate change and adverse shocks in renewable sources."

 """,2024.,Mitigating Policies for Pollutant Emissions in a DSGE for the Brazilian Economy,"591, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper examines the dynamic behavior of the Brazilian economy under policy regimes aimed at controlling pollutant emissions and limiting environmental damage. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are assumed to be of two types: carbon from fossil resources burning for energy generation (i.e., thermoelectric) or carbon and non-carbon outputs from production processes (i.e., methane from cattle). Firms optimally decide on the demand for fossil and green energy, as the level of effort dedicated to abating emissions coming from production processes. Two alternative policies for emissions, which include emissions taxation (fixed cost) and emission permits trade (quantity caps), are introduced into an open-economy DSGE model for the Brazilian economy. Departing from the estimated parameters of the original version of the model, ratios in the new block of equations for the energy and emissions are calibrated using sectoral data, and some elasticities are set to reproduce the sensibility to some shocks implicit in the NGFS scenarios (Net Zero 2050). Simulations indicate neither of the emissions policies can induce transition in the energy matrix without a green investment policy. The approach adopted here is a first step in building a macroeconomic model capable of challenging scenarios from more specialized models dedicated to energy and emissions by better assessing possible effects and feedback related to the iterations with macroeconomic dynamics. Despite the difficulties concerning the limited availability of data in higher frequency, results indicate those modeling approaches are sufficiently flexible to incorporate the main aspects of energy and emission, serving as valuable tools for policy analysis."

We study this growth mecha- nism using a large-scale program to expand the supply of credit to small and medium enterprises in Brazil. Local credit supply shocks generate greater firm entry but also greater exit with no effect on short-run employment growth in the formal sector. However, credit expansions increase average capability among entering firms, which enter at larger size, survive longer, and grow faster. These firm dynamics are more pronounced in areas with ex ante weaker credit markets and consistent with local bank branches using cheap targeted credit lines to expand lending more broadly. Our findings provide new evidence on the general equilibrium effects of credit supply expansions."

We apply double filtering estimators on a comprehensive cross-country panel over a sample period that includes two events of extreme global distress and find evidence that not only does the level of uncertainty rise in crisis; but its passthrough to economic activity becomes greater, accentuating the drag of crisis on economic activity. At the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, our estimations show that uncertainty alone contributed to 20% of the drop in global GDP.

Moreover, we demonstrate that the amplification of initial shocks is more pronounced through this channel compared to the traditional firms’ loans channel.

A mud avalanche ran out for 600 km (373 miles) until it reached the Atlantic Ocean, leaving behind extreme ecological and economic damage in the Doce River basin. This is the largest environmental disaster in Brazil to date. We quantify the negative externalities using rich, identified, and comprehensive data from firm-to-firm electronic payments and individual-level consumer credit usage. We find that agricultural producers in affected municipalities received cumulatively 41% to 60% fewer inflows (income) from customer firms outside the affected zone three years after the disaster. Effects are driven by municipalities where the river shore is larger relative to the farming area. In these municipalities, individuals also faced an 8% fall in their credit card and consumer finance expenditures. This result is stronger for non-formal and high-risk workers. Thus, water contamination led to (first) production and (later) consumption decline with real effects on municipality-level agriculture and services’ output, causing a 7% decline in local GDP."

First, the number of Pix transactions and users increases when either the payer or the payee is in a municipality that was not affected by the robbery. Second, we show that the population affected by such robberies start to perform Pix transactions and use other financial services at digital financial institutions, indicating that cash dependence can be an impediment to their expansion.

The main reason is that the method incorporates relevant transformations observed in the Brazilian economy in recent years, such as monetary policy credibility gains and lower inflation targets. In turn, the results based on the full sample, up to August 2022, show larger forecast errors after the pandemic, which caused huge outliers in macroeconomic variables world-wide.

P2P clients get lower interest rates compared to traditional banks. Once they borrow from P2Ps, they find a lower rate on subsequent bank loans, indicating that banks try to recapture runaway borrowers. In response to P2P entry, incumbent banks in oligopolistic markets decrease their lending rates by 2.5 percentage points and expand credit to older firms with difficulty accessing credit. We rationalize these findings in a structural IO model of the banking sector, where banks and P2Ps have different profit functions and compete for clients with risk heterogeneity. We use the estimated model to calculate welfare gains. P2Ps significantly increase social welfare in oligopolistic markets by offering lower interest rates to riskier borrowers and forcing the banks to do the same. Welfare gains range from 10% of the local output in municipalities with only one incumbent bank to 1% in those with five banks."

By decreasing the expected loss given default of creditors, policies aimed at improving creditor protection may also change the banking market structure. We study a Brazilian bankruptcy reform in 2005 that improved the recoverability of secured creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. We find that local banking concentration decreases in Brazilian municipalities that were more affected by the reform. This result is explained by non-leader banks gaining market share over local leader banks due to the reform. These results are robust to controlling for financial constraints variables. Furthermore, consistent with stronger collateral value reducing information asymmetry, more opaque firms benefit the most from the reform. Overall, our results highlight the role of creditor rights reforms in breaking the information monopoly of incumbent banks."

The decision variable to be chosen by the financial regulator is the net worth-to-IB assets ratio assigned to each bank – the capital requirement (CR) – , aiming at minimizing both the fraction of IB assets lost as a consequence of an exogenous initial shock and the total net worth as a fraction of total IB assets. This framework is applied to a Brazilian data set considering two CR regimes: the homogeneous (same CR for all banks) and the heterogeneous regime (different CRs for each bank). The optimization in the heterogeneous regime is performed through a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), solved through a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). We have found that the heterogeneous regime brings a Pareto gain over the homogeneous one: a smaller level of losses is achieved for the same aggregate CR. In the heterogeneous case, for each level of the initial shock, there is a critical value of aggregate CR below which financial crises become more frequent and more severe. Moreover, the decision variable assigned by different critical Pareto optimal points – i.e., those which generate values of CR close to its critical value – varies significantly. Finally, this variable is smaller and less dispersed for banks with a higher degree (i.e., those with more connections in the IB market, as well as a higher volume of IB assets and liabilities)."

This measure can be obtained from fixed-rate and inflation-indexed government bonds. However, this task has two difficulties: a) inflation-indexed securities have an indexation lag in respect to inflation; and b) the seasonality of inflation implies seasonality of the real rate. The objective of this paper is to propose an alternative method for BEIR estimation using only government bonds, as well as to determine if this measure contains information on future short-term inflation. A good measure of BEIR estimated directly from bonds is relevant since these are the inflation-linked instruments with the highest liquidity. The empirical results show that the proposed BEIR is superior to the BEIR that do not take into account the problems of lag-indexation and seasonality and is statistically equal to or better than survey-based inflation expectations and the BEIR extracted from the future market when forecasting short-term inflation. Furthermore, the results show the lag and seasonal adjustments are more important for the estimation of the BEIR in the short term. An advantage of the proposed BEIR in relation to survey-based inflation expectations is that it allows for real-time monitoring, since it is continually updated."

For the calculation of the useful life, the sample banknotes were classified according to wear levels and those classified as level 4 to 6 should be withdrawn from circulation. The time in circulation was calculated based on the dates of issue and withdrawal from circulation. Survival analysis allowed the comparison between banknotes with and without application of varnish, considering both banknotes that had already reached this level of wear, as well as those that were in better situations.

We first propose a novel methodology to estimate bank market power at the local level. We design a data-intensive method for computing a local Lerner index by developing heuristics to allocate national-level bank inputs, products, and costs to each branch locality using data from many sources. We then explore the exogenous variation in COVID-19 prevalence across Brazilian localities to analyze how the pandemic influenced local market power through the effective price and marginal cost channels. Despite reducing the economic activity substantially in more affected localities, COVID-19 did not significantly impact the effective price channel: bank branches offset the decrease in credit income by reducing credit concessions. However, bank branches more affected by COVID-19 experienced increased marginal costs as they could not rapidly adjust their cost factors in response to the decrease in credit concessions. Consequently, COVID-19 reduced banks’ local market power via the marginal cost channel. However, banks that spent more in IT before the COVID-19 outbreak suffered less replacing more easily local borrowers with remote ones. We then design a bank-specific measure of exposure to COVID-19 to examine how the pandemic affected different banks within the same locality. Banks more exposed to COVID-19 increased their local market power mainly via the effective price channel, which operated through a negative supply shock and not increased credit income. The paper provides new insights as to how crises can affect local market power in non-trivial ways."

Evidence from Brazilian data,"557, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","In network models of systemic risk, the loss distribution of a distressed debtor among its creditors follows a pro-rata fashion. It is proportional to the loan granted to the debtor. Despite its simplicity, this assumption is unrealistic. In this study, we create a framework for the computation of the systemic risk assuming a heterogeneous pattern of loss distribution, the default pecking order. Distressed debtors employ some criterion (equity, out-degree, or loan extended) to rank the creditors they are willing to default on first. Applying this framework to an extensive Brazilian data set, we found out the adoption of the default pecking order increases significantly the systemic risk. The rise in the systemic risk brought by the heterogeneous distribution over the homogeneous case decreases with the level of the initial shock and is higher for small-sized agents. This result can be interpreted in the light of the dual role of the financial network, which can be a channel for both risk-sharing and shock propagation. We test this hypothesis by assessing the role of interconnectedness (as measured by the network density) in driving the systemic risk. The results corroborate this hypothesis. When the homogeneous loss distribution (which maximizes risk-sharing) is abandoned, the density has a positive impact on the systemic risk. It suggests in this case the financial network acts mainly as a channel for shock propagation rather than for risk-sharing."

Systemic impact is mainly driven by topological features for both types of FIs. However, while the importance of topological features to the prediction of systemic impact of banks increases with the level of the initial shock, it decreases for credit unions. Concerning systemic vulnerability, this is mainly determined by financial features, whose importance increases with the initial shock level for both types of FIs."

Using the estimated model, I performed counterfactual exercises, finding the higher lending rates in Brazil vis-à-vis other South American countries between 2012 and 2016 can be explained by (i) IOF tax, (ii) high level of the risk-free interest rate, (iii) higher probability of default, (iv) lower recovery rate, and (v) more concentrated financial system. This result is mainly driven by the cost components, as the changes in IOF tax, risk-free interest rate, recovery rate, and probability of default account for 89% of the optimal lending rate reduction in the counterfactual scenario. Or, in terms of optimal bank interest spread, costs explain 78% of the decrease.

This paper examines why and when delinquent bank loans are forborne, using a novel dataset with over 13 million delinquent loans to non-financial firms in Brazil, from which 1.1 million are forborne. Our evidence shows that larger loans are more likely to be forborne, and that the greater the difficulty to seize collateral, the larger the probability of forbearance. Previous forbearances to a borrower are also positively associated with the probability of forbearance, which may be an indicative of loan evergreening. We also show that more than 80% of forbearance events occur in less than four months after a loan becomes more than 60 days past due (after which the bank may no longer accrue interest). Finally, we find that a regulatory rule that forces banks to increase provisions of non-delinquent loans when the same borrower also has a delinquent loan creates incentives for banks to forbear delinquent loans. Because loan evergreening may pose macroeconomic resource allocation problems and forbearance may be used to conceal loan losses, decrease provisions and manage earnings and capital, our findings have implications for the design of regulation and supervisory processes."

The focus is on important traded commodities, whose supply function is very price inelastic in the short run, such as oil and major metal commodities. The paper contributions are as follows. First, the synchronicity of oil-price and global activity cycles is presented using the tools of the common-feature literature. Second, it is shown how to improve forecasts of global activity using commodity prices, noting that one observes the latter at an almost continuous-time basis, but the former at a much lower frequency and with considerable delay. Third, the usefulness of optimal forecast combinations for oil prices is discussed employing a wide array of macroeconomic and financial variables. The out-of-sample R2 statistic for model combinations can reach up to about 14%, a major improvement over the previous literature."

Using a novel individual-level data set including matched credit registry and employer-employee information, we show that individuals with higher debt-to-income growth during the boom experienced lower subsequent credit card expenditure during the recession. To identify the credit-supply effect, we exploit individuals borrowing from both government-controlled and private banks. We show that, during the late stages of the boom period, government banks increased their lending more than private banks to the same individual. To study the effect of this credit supply shock on individual consumption, we exploit variation in the sector of employment of each borrower. Individuals employed by the public sector were disproportionately targeted by payroll loans offered by government banks and experienced larger decline in credit card spending during the subsequent recession."

We find that firms with more bank relationships employ significantly more workers and pay significantly higher wages. Moreover, increases (decreases) in the number of bank relationships result in positive (negative) effects on employment and wages. These results are robust for strictly exogenous changes in the number of bank relationships due to nationwide bank M&A activity, when using instrumental variable regressions, and are independent of firm size. The effects are due (but not limited) to higher credit availability, lower cost of credit and higher heterogeneity in firms’ bank relationships. Importantly, the firm-level results consistently translate into positive macroeconomic effects at the municipality and state levels. The evidence is novel and suggests positive effects of multiple bank relationships on labor market outcomes in an emerging economy."

We use detailed administrative data and an empirical strategy that compares changes in outcomes for financially constrained firms, which were affected by the bankruptcy reform, with unconstrained firms, which were largely unaffected by the reform. Following the bankruptcy reform and subsequent expansion in credit, constrained firms increased employment, especially of high-skilled workers. We also observe an increase in wages, with gains concentrated on skilled workers and on workers who were employed at constrained firms prior to the reform. To rationalize these findings, we design a model in which heterogeneous producers face constraints in their ability to borrow and have production functions featuring capital-skill complementarity. Using this framework, we estimate that the reallocation of resources induced by the bankruptcy reform accounts for 36 percent of the observed increase in aggregate productivity in Brazil during the 2000s."

In this paper we seek to evaluate whether this is a result of a compressed ex-ante equity risk premium, using two different approaches. First, we investigate the effects of government-controlled shareholders, which could lower the risk premium if the government is also interested in nonpecuniary benefits. To verify this, we estimate the Brazilian equity risk premium from 2002 to 2017 using cross-section regressions based on the CAPM and the Gordon model, but supposing stocks are priced differently by government and private investors. An important feature of this approach is that we control for the possible impact of the government as firm’s manager on the perceived risk of the firm. Our results suggest the government does not compress the equity risk premium, although the government as a manager seems to influence the firms’ risk. Second, we decompose the Brazilian equity risk premium using a global CAPM estimated with quarterly data from 47 countries and find it is consistent with international risk premia. Therefore, the findings from the two approaches indicate the low ex-post risk premium in Brazil seems to be a consequence of a relatively short time series rather than a Brazilian idiosyncrasy."

To be useful for macroprudential policy, a DSGE needs to have financial crises along the equilibrium path. RegGae embeds financial crises in DSGEs as regime switches, events that change the structural relationships in the economy. The solu-tion concept of RegGae is regime-wise linearization, a procedure that preserves the non-linearities of models of financial crises. The transition probabilities governing the switch are endogenous, conditional on the state variables. With the toolkit, DSGEs can be used to draw the distribution of variables in order to measure the expected welfare of macroprudential policy. This allows for calibrating macropru-dential tools to trade off mean and variance optimally. The toolkit unifies DSGE modeling with early warning (crisis prediction) methods. The endogeneity of the probability of regime switches reflects the fact that the probability of financial crises depends on the state of the economy while its timing cannot be forecasted. Because financial markets do not anticipate financial crises, RegGae assumes the typical per-fect foresight of the future sequence of regimes."

Surprisingly, such numbers are compatible with investors’ risk aversions that accommodate the very different U.S. market evidence, reinforcing the belief that national investors are similar in nature. The equity premium has been higher in Brazil than in the U.S., but the much higher Brazilian volatility discourages heavier investments in stocks."

This paper shows, based on a general characterization of the steady state capital cost, it is possible to obtain natural interest rate equations for (i) the standard or single funding rate case and (ii) the dual funding rate case. These equations become economically interpretable when more theoretical structure is added, assuming, for instance, a CES production function and a price-setting rule. This allows the use of the equations not only to estimate the natural interest rate, but also to evaluate its results. As an application, I estimate the Brazilian natural rate between 2002Q2 and 2017Q4 using the dual funding rate equation for a Cobb-Douglas production function and a semistructural macroeconomic model. The results indicate the real natural interest rate in Brazil has rapidly decreased between 2009 and 2014, from 12% p.a. to 4% p.a., mainly reflecting the lowering of the steady-state output growth rate. Given a higher potential growth, Brazil’s natural rate would be still high by international standards. Comparing to Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru between 2005 and 2012, the higher Brazilian rate is justified by the impact of the subsidized lending by the BNDES and, most importantly, by both the low total savings rate and the low level of firms’ markup."

However, banks restricted credit to borrowers in low homeownership municipalities. These areas experienced a decline in entrepreneurship, local labor demand, and economic activity. The credit reallocation was greatest for credit-constrained banks, consistent with higher external financing costs. Finally, the differential effects in credit supply induced a redistribution of labor in the economy: workers migrated from low to high homeownership municipalities after the reform."

To do so, we explore the improvement in the creditor protection produced by a new bankruptcy law approved in early 2005 in Brazil. Using monthly data on bank interest rates for corporate and consumer loans, we find that market concentration hampers 27.5% of the potential reducing effect of the law in the interest rate of new corporate credit operations. If we consider the average market concentration over all credit lines (treated and control groups), then the hampering effect represents 295 basis points, or 40.1%. Similar results are obtained when using Panzar and Rosse (1987) competition measure. The results show that an institutional reform that increases creditors protection has a positive effect on credit condition, but the concentration/competition structure of the market may diminish these effects considerably."

The model is calibrated for the Brazilian economy and results indicate the exchange rate plays a central role in the transmission of foreign shocks, but not of domestic shocks. Considering the volatility of the variables and convergence to steady state, the interest rate rule should target domestic inflation and not respond directly to the exchange rate. The reserve requirement rule, in its turn, should react countercyclically to the credit-gap and not have a fixed component. There is complementarity between monetary and macroprudential policies to stabilize the small open economy."

We develop a model of heterogeneous firms and concentration in the banking sector that is consistent with the micro evidence. In our model, the semi-elasticity of credit to lending rates is a sufficient statistic for the effect of concentration on output, which we estimate to be -3.17. Among other counterfactuals, we show that if Brazilian spreads fell to world levels, output would increase by approximately 5%."

Using the counter-cyclical reaction of government-owned banks in Brazil after Lehman's failure as a policy experiment, we show that credit shocks originated in bank-firm relationships are transmitted throughout the network of suppliers and customers, with measurable consequences for firms' real outcomes and survival probability. A firm with direct and indirect access to government credit (through its customers or suppliers) observed a 12.5% greater survival probability, vis-à-vis 4% when the firm has only direct access. Critically, we uncover drawbacks of these interventions, including a persistent increased concentration in the market share of firms that benefited from government liquidity."

We use a unique dataset covering 5,555 municipalities in the Brazilian economy with granular information on credit characteristics. We find that non-earmarked credit to the corporate sector associates with municipal economic growth more strongly than earmarked credit, despite the increase in relevance of the latter after the global financial crisis. We also find that the credit modality---whether it is general purpose or purpose-specific loans---associates with economic growth in different ways. Overall, credit provided by domestic private banks to the corporate sector correlates with higher economic growth rates. In contrast, only after the crisis the relationship between credit from state-owned banks and economic growth becomes statistically significant. While we follow the finance-growth literature in our empirical exercises using internal instruments in GMM estimations, we also provide robustness tests using two additional external instruments: the number of complaints filed against each bank and the local credit accessibility. Our results with external instruments indicate the same findings with respect to the use of traditional internal instruments in GMM estimations."

In the simulations, we compare the outcomes of these initial shocks after resolution processes with and without bail-ins. The simulations show that by avoiding the liquidation of banks and the resulting interruption in their credit provision, bail-ins would be effective in preventing the amplification of losses imposed on the real sector. Analyzing the effects that the liquidation of Brazilian Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) would cause to credit provision to economic sectors, we find bailing in these banks would produce a relevant decrease in credit crunches. However, in our sample, only a few banks could benefit from bail-ins due to insufficiency of bail-inable instruments. To tackle this issue, we carry out a study based on counterfactual simulations to assess if and how setting requirements for bail-inable instruments would affect the likelihood of a successful bail-in.

The model is developed to represent Brazilian bank credit markets. It features three types of bank credit — housing, consumer and commercial — as well as loans provided by a development bank. Loans are long-term, and government regulates housing loans, influencing both interest rates and loan supply. Banks are subject to bank capital requirement, and both broad (CCyB) and sectoral (SCCyB) countercyclical buffers can be introduced by macroprudential authorities. We simulate alternative policies using SCCyBs and CCyB with implementable nonlinear rules using broad and sectoral credit gaps as indicators, and compared the resulting performances. We conclude that, compared with CCyB alone, SCCyBs provide a more flexible set of instruments that allows achieving better macroeconomic stabilization in terms of variances of credit, total capital requirement and capital adequacy ratio. However, the marginal benefit of those SCCyB policies relative to the CCyB-only policy is lower than the improvements obtained by this latter policy compared with the reference scenario with no buffer. Also, SCCyB policies imply more frequent intervention, suggesting that in practice introducing these additional instruments may require more complex implementation procedures."

The most important implication of the model’s solution is that a higher ex-ante dispersion in central bankers’ preferences, referred to as heterogeneity in policy orientation, increases the signaling cost of commitment to inflation targets. The model allows for a comparison of two distinct institutional arrangements regarding the tenure in office of the central banker and the head of government. We find that staggered terms yield superior equilibria when opportunistic political business cycles can arise from presidential elections. This is a consequence of a reduction of information asymmetry about monetary policy and gives theoretic support to the observed practice of staggered terms among independent central banks."

In this framework, when international interest rates fall, EM sovereign spreads decline despite increases in debt and default risk.

Cities more nearby (geographic closeness) and that transact more (economic closeness) with advanced centers have higher growth rates, suggesting the existence of positive spillovers. Economic spillovers are more critical than geographic spillovers for growth.

Next, we compute the expected losses due to fiscal risk using a combination of the probability of default with potential losses that the public sector would impose on the economy using a complex network model. Motivated by the crisis on Brazilian states after 2015, we use Brazil to illustrate the usefulness of our model. We estimate the probability of default of states using legal restrictions on consolidated debt and personnel expenses. While most states are struggling to comply with limits on personnel expenses, the richest states have trouble to comply with limits on the consolidated debt. Using a network model that embeds counterparty and funding risks to estimate losses, we find state-owned banks are most likely to be affected if states default on bank credit.

In order to analyze predictability from a cross-section perspective, we build portfolios based on the slope of the term structure, and thus present a new currency trading strategy. For developed (emerging) currencies, we buy (sell) the two currencies with the lowest slopes and sell (buy) those two with the highest slopes.

Using theoretical and numerical resources recently incorporated into the economic literature, we adjusted the model to the Brazilian data in order to simulate the effects of the removal of credit earmarking policies. Our simulations indicate that the extinction of earmarked credit programs would generate several positive effects, such as increased output and productivity, reduced inequality and financial inclusion. Next, we simulate variations in earmarking policies, evaluating the impacts of giving greater focus to poorer or more productive entrepreneurs. While these changes can lead to improvements, our simulations indicate smaller gains than the mere removal of earmarking programs."

Our analyses suggest that private banks significantly reduced the amount of loans granted during the most severe period of the crisis. By contrast, government owned banks expanded the volume of loans granted during the same period, both regular loans and those that are earmarked, possibly acting in a counter cyclical manner. We did not find a statistically significant increase in the percentage of earmarked loans over total loans during the most severe period of the crisis. We also did not find evidence of an association between the percentage of earmarked loans to total loans in the pre-crisis period and the average growth of loans during the crisis.

We show that when analyzing the impact of a fiscal stimulus during a zero interest rate episode, there is more than just short-run output multipliers. We extend the analysis in Eggertsson (2011) by allowing for a transitional state in which the zero lower bound is no longer binding, but policies can be expected to credibly deviate from their steady-state values. The main result of the paper is that, to have larger positive effects on output, monetary and fiscal policies should last longer than the duration of the shock and be coordinated. This coordination is required not only during the crisis but also in the commitment to future policy actions. It is fundamental to the fiscal authority to be able to respond quickly to the shock, minimizing implementation delays and correctly signaling the duration of the stimulus. We also show that a thoughtful evaluation of a fiscal stimulus in terms of the implied welfare losses should account not only for the effects of policies on short-run output and inflation, but also for the present discounted value of output and inflation in future periods as well."

To investigate this question, I develop a quantitative model of sovereign default extended to incorporate real exchange rates and inflation. I find that an economy issuing LC debt defaults less often, sustains slightly lower debt levels, and presents positive average inflation. The net effect is a modest welfare loss when compared to issuing debt in FC. However, if monetary policy is credible, the welfare change is positive, but also of limited size. In this case, the real exchange rate serves as a buffer to accommodate negative output shocks and to prevent defaults."

Yet little is known about how labor market characteristics in these countries, for example large informal labor markets, interact with the incentive effects of UI. In this paper, we show that firms and workers collude to extract rents from the UI system in the presence of large informal labor markets. Exploiting a discontinuous effect of an unemployment insurance reform in Brazil, we document layoff and rehiring patterns consistent with collusion between firms and workers to extract rents from the UI system. Firms and workers time formal unemployment spells to coincide with workers' eligibility for UI benefits. Survey evidence suggests that firms employ workers informally while they are eligible for UI benefits and rehire them when benefits end. Combined with a lower probability of hiring replacement workers when laying off workers eligible for UI benefits, this suggests that firms employ workers informally while they are on benefits. Firms and workers share the rents extracted from the UI system through lower equilibrium wages. All the observed patterns are mostly driven by industries and municipalities with large informal labor markets. Our findings thus suggest that optimal UI design in mid-income and developing countries needs to take into account adverse incentive effects generated by collusion between firms and workers in the presence of informal labor markets."

Firms experience increasing financial costs that revert to banks in the form of credit defaults, exacerbating the aftereffects of the monetary policy change. We apply the model to a unique data set from Brazil and find nonlinear and asymmetric effects on firms and banks that depend on the magnitude and direction of policy rate changes. The effects of interest rate changes are distinct in environments of expansion and recession.

We use a sample of 52 countries for the period 1980–2011, and our main finding is that, at moderate levels of financial depth, further deepening increases the ratio of average economic growth to volatility; however, as financial depth gets higher, this relation reverts, and the rise in volatility overcomes that of economic growth. This result is obtained both in the medium and long run; however, the peak of the relation seems to be lower in the medium run (domestic credit-to-GDP ratio around 40% to 55%) than in the long run (around 75% to 99%). This suggests that increasing the domestic credit-to-GDP ratio may intensify relative volatility in the medium term, but still may raise relative long-term growth before the long-run threshold is achieved."

We apply the methods proposed by Baele et al. (2015) and a basic new Keynesian model, with the addition of new elements to the AS curve and a new equation for the exchange rate dynamics. We find evidence of two distinct regimes for the exchange rate pass-through and for the volatility of shocks to inflation. Under the so-called “normal” regime, the long-run pass-through to consumer prices inflation is estimated at near zero value, only 0.00057 percentage point given a 1% exchange rate shock. Comparatively, the expected pass-through under a “crisis” regime is of 0.1035 percentage point to inflation, for the same exchange rate shock. The Markov-switching (MS) model outperforms the fixed parameters model according to several comparison criteria. The results allowed us to identify the occurrence of three distinct cycles for the exchange rate pass-through during the inflation targeting period in Brazil."

We find that, while banks from IT countries with high quality of institutions do not have their stability significantly enhanced by this policy (the ``paradox of credibility''), countries with average levels of quality of institutions seem to benefit from it. In addition, in the estimations, IT and financial stability are negatively associated in countries with low levels of institutional quality, which is consistent with the fact that governments must have at least some trust of their population in order to conduct effective economic policies.

The results indicate that the prediction of the asymmetric CAViaR model with quantile interval of (1, 99) is better than (or equal to) 66% of the models and worse than 34%. In turn, the other benchmark model, the GARCH (1,1), is worse than 71% of the models, better than 13%, and equal in forecasting precision to 16% of the models."

To estimate this credibility, we use the Kalman filter in two measures of inflation expectations (breakeven inflation and Focus survey) with a medium/long-term forecast horizon. The results indicate four shifts in the perceived credibility based on breakeven inflation: (i) decline in mid-2008, during the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis; (ii) relative stability from early 2009 to mid-2015; (iii) strong decline by the end of 2015; and (iv) recovery from mid-2016 until mid-2017 (end of the sample). The credibility measure based on the Focus survey showed a more regular behavior, reflecting the degree of anchoring of the survey-based inflation expectations for the considered horizon. By associating the estimated credibility with financial and macroeconomic variables, we have also found that credibility is relatively persistent and seems not to be influenced by short-run movements of such variables."

On the one hand, the network contagion literature tends to emphasize the influence of the network topology. On the other hand, policy works tend to discuss restrictions over the capital buffers of financial institutions. Systemic risk is usually a complex function of both risk drivers and thus isolating the contributive effects of each risk driver to systemic risk is not a trivial task. Our decomposition methodology identifies and isolates these effects. We apply our methodology to the global banking network and find that the network topology effect explains most of the systemic risk measure's volatility. Additionally, we show that the capital buffer effect explains the persistent reduction in systemic risk buildup with effects concentrated around the global financial crisis.

LTV limits and related policies entail identification challenges, since constrained individuals are no longer directly observed after the regulation. We use comprehensive credit register information of individual housing loans augmented with a detailed, granular employment register. We focus on the average treatment effect on the treated borrowers, defined as the ones that would violate the LTV limit if allowed to do so. Partially observed treatment status is overcome by the use of an adjusted difference-in-difference method. In the housing loan segment that was subject to a sudden increase in demand due to broader eligibility rules, constrained individuals borrow housing loans with higher interest rates, shortened maturities, and, as expected, reduced loan amounts and LTV. These borrowers also purchase more affordable homes and are less likely to be in arrears 12 months in the future. In the other housing loan segment, subject to more stringent eligibility criteria, constrained borrowers also meet the LTV threshold, but the resulting contract terms stay roughly the same."

For this purpose, we identify an exogenous increase in agricultural profits due to the adoption of genetically engineered soy in Brazil. We find that regions with larger increases in agricultural productivity experienced larger increases in local bank deposits. However, there was no increase in local bank lending. Instead, capital was reallocated towards other regions through bank branch networks. This increase in credit supply affected firms' credit access through the extensive and intensive margin. First, regions with more bank branches receiving funds from soy areas experienced an increase in credit market participation of small and medium sized firms. In addition, banks experiencing faster deposit growth in soy areas increased their lending to firms with whom they had preexisting relationships. In turn, these firms grew faster in terms of employment and wage bill. Our estimates imply that the elasticity of firm growth to credit is largest in the manufacturing sector.

The results show that there is evidence that the Petrobras options market is not efficient. In 371 day-trade strategies (which have average investment of R$81,000 and average duration of one hour and thirteen minutes), 85% of strategies were profitable and the average return was 0.49%, which corresponds to more than 1,600% of the 1-day risk free interest rate."

We illustrate the model using data on Brazilian bank-bank and bank-firm loans. We show that the contagion feedback effect – which accounts for second and higher-order rounds of stress propagation and is overlooked by the existing literature – is economically significant.

We also provide evidence that, during abrupt exchange rate depreciation episodes, economies that are more open to trade experience a larger change in current account and trade balance. In other words, our results indicate that improvements in current account and trade balance are accompanied by a smaller exchange rate depreciation in more open economies. These findings are robust to different measures of openness to trade and methodologies of identifying sudden stops and abrupt exchange rate depreciations."

The main determinants of the extent of inflationary pass-through of the depreciations (appreciations) are the cyclical component of output, the extent of initial overvaluation of the real exchange rate (RER), the initial rate of inflation, and the degree of openness of the economy. The paper finds that the pass-through coefficients increase the larger is the horizon measured, with its peak at 12-months. It also finds that RER misalignment is the most important determinant of inflation for emerging markets while the initial inflation is the most important variable for developed countries. Using the estimated model, the paper predicts somewhat higher inflation than actually observed in several well-known large depreciation cases, even if one takes into account existing measures of exchange rate expectations. This suggests that policy makers should use caution when using past models to predict future inflation in the aftermath of large depreciations."

Next, we apply a difference-in-differences framework using firms not yet penalized for “unregistered employee” infractions as the control group to estimate the effect of labor inspections on firm-level outcomes. We find that formal employment and formal labor hiring experience a positive spike in the year of the inspection, indicating the formalization of unregistered employees. However, formal employment declines steadily over time, dropping nearly 60% by the fourth year after inspection. Among firms with active bank relationships, revenue falls sharply by about 24% over the same period. We also observe a persistent reduction in the outstanding loan amount and significant rise in the non-performing loan ratio. The average formal wage drops by about 1% in the year of inspection, but returns to pre-inspection levels in later years. Our findings are consistent with firms reducing their overall labor usage due to higher labor costs, which arise from increased compliance with labor regulations following a labor inspection."

We employ the FGV-IBRE Economic Tendency Survey, which consists of monthly qualitative information from approximately 2,000 consumers since 2006, and the Focus Survey of the Central Bank of Brazil, with daily forecasts since 1999 from roughly 250 registered professional forecasters. Natural candidates to win a forecast competition in the literature of surveys of expectations are the (consensus) cross-sectional average forecasts (AF). In an exploratory investigation, we first show that these forecasts are a bias ridden version of the conditional expectation of inflation. The no-bias tests are conducted for the intercept and slope using the methods in Issler and Lima (2009) and Gaglianone and Issler (2015). The results reveal interesting data features: consumers systematically overpredict inflation (by 2.01 p.p., on average), whereas market agents underpredict it (by -0.68 p.p. over the same sample). Next, we employ a pseudo out-of-sample analysis to evaluate different forecasting methods: the AR(1) model, the Granger and Ramanathan (1984) forecast combination (GR), the consensus forecast (AF), the Bias-Corrected Average Forecast (BCAF), and the extended BCAF. Results reveal that: (i) the MSE of the AR(1) model is higher compared to the GR (and usually lower compared to the AF); and (ii) the extended BCAF is more accurate than the BCAF, which, in turn, dominates the AF. This validates the view that the bias corrections are a useful device for forecasting using surveys."

Thereby, historical interpretation and forecasts can hold internal consistency, which improves storytelling and calls for an in-depth forecasting.

Between 2000 and 2010, the country adopted new institutional rules that allowed an increase in credit supply. Among them, we can mention the fiduciary law and changes in non-earmarked credit regulation that expanded the volume of mortgage. Comparting the data from the 2000 census with the 2010 census, we can see that there was some improvement in the problem of housing shortage, since there was a reduction in the average number of residents per household and per bedroom. One way to verify how the credit market expansion was related to this improvement is to identify how mortgage affects household formation. This study used data from municipalities for the years 2000 and 2010 to try to answer this question empirically. The results indicate that an increase of 100% in outstanding credit increases by about 10% the number of households. This result was obtained using an instrumental variable, since it is possible that credit is an endogenous due to unobserved local characteristics, such as real estate prices. Credit for legal entities was proposed as an instrumental variable, since there are local aspects that may expand credit in general. To support the empirical analysis, it was developed a theoretical model that emphasized the importance of controlling for factors such as income and demographics. In empirical analysis, age has shown to performance a decisive role for determining housing demand. Finally, this result remained robust after controlling for other kinds of local heterogeneity."

At first, China`s accumulation strategy, based on the repression of domestic consumption demand, generated an excess supply without a compensating increase in domestic demand. The solution was found in establishing a pattern of trade deficits and surpluses between China and its partners, on the one hand, and consuming countries, especially the United States, on the other hand, resulting in an arrangement that reorganized aggregate demand and supply among countries in a mutually beneficial way. However, on the financial side, there has been a progressive mismatch of risks that eventually led to the global financial crisis of 2008. Particularly, countries with current account surpluses, through the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by their central banks, agreed to cover the exchange rate risk, but not the credit risk being generated by consumers. This ""residual"" credit risk was then accumulated within the financial system, which saw dramatic growth until the crisis of 2008. With the outbreak of the crisis, this system of commercial and financial intermediation collapsed. To take its place in an attempt to generate new sources of aggregate demand, and due to political constraints to fiscal expansion, each member of the system, in its own way, replaced the pre-crisis arrangements with unconventional monetary policy measures. This led to ""liquidity tsunamis"" of foreign capital during the post-crisis period, particularly for emerging economies. Despite restoring the global liquidity level, these policies still did not re-established the pre-crisis levels of economic growth and exchange rates."

Merging loans database with employment data from RAIS (Annual Social Information Report), we also investigate the effects of monetary policy rate on employment. Our results indicate that changes in policy rate have smaller effect on the level of employment for firms with more access to earmarked and government-owned banks loans.

The model allows recovering the changes in prices and volatility patterns observed in this sector, relating the jumps with the events observed in the period 2000-2015. We apply the model to estimate risk management measures, hedging and portfolio allocation and performing a comparison with other multivariate models of conditional volatility. Based on the results, we may conclude that the proposed model has a better performance when used to calculate portfolio VaR, since it does not reject the hypothesis of correct nominal coverage with certain specifications presented in this work.

 """,2015.,Local Unit Root and Inflationary Inertia in Brazil,"406, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","In this paper, we study the persistence of Brazilian inflation using quantile regression techniques. To characterize the inflation dynamics we employ the Quantile Autoregression model (QAR) of Koenker and Xiao (2004, 2006), where the autoregressive coefficient may assume different values in distinct quantiles, allowing testing the asymmetry hypothesis for the inflation dynamics. Furthermore, the model allows investigating the existence of a local unit root behavior, with episodes of mean reversion sufficient to ensure stationarity. In other words, the model enables one to identify locally unsustainable dynamics, but still compatible with global stationarity; and it can be reformulated in a more conventional random coefficient notation to reveal the periods of local non-stationarity. Another advantage of this technique is the estimation method, which does not require knowledge of the innovation process distribution, making the approach robust against poorly specified models. An empirical exercise with Brazilian inflation data and its components illustrates the methodology. As expected, the behavior of inflation dynamics is not uniform across different conditional quantiles. In particular, the results can be summarized as follows: (i) the dynamics is stationary for most quantiles; (ii) the process is non-stationary in the upper tail of the conditional distribution; (iii) the periods associated with local unsustainable dynamics can be related to those of increased risk aversion and higher inflation expectations; and (iv) out-of-sample forecasting exercises show that the QAR model at the median quantile level can exhibit, in some cases, lower mean squared error (MSE) compared to the random walk and AR forecasts."

Using a large dataset from the Brazilian credit registry, it was found that secured debt usage increased 13 percentage points after the reform, together with a reinforcement in the use of more liquid collateral agreements. It proved that the law had a varying effect across groups of borrowers with different amounts of collateral pledged before the reform. Firms previously pledging amounts of collateral in excess of the value of the loan could access credit with a much lower collateralization rate after the introduction of the law. However, the collateralization rate significantly increased for firms with lower-pledge levels, imposing an extra cost on them. The study showed that a multiple banking set-up may give such borrowers an option out of overcollateralization, as foreign-owned banks demanded substantially less collateral compared with domestic-owned banks after the reform.

Considering several evidences in the literature pointing to the fact that interbank markets seem to self-organize in core-periphery structures, this finding suggest that interbank systems drive themselves to a network organization that enhances the financial system liquidity. In contrast, we also argue that core-periphery structures can lead to large liquidity shortfalls in the financial network in case a core bank defaults, implying a greater systemic risk. Nonetheless, we show that the default probabilities of core banks are very low in the Brazilian interbank market."

Consistent with stylized facts, the shock triggers an expansion in domestic credit and activity, asset price pressures, and a real appreciation. A credit-based reserve requirement rule helps to mitigate both macroeconomic and financial volatility, with the latter defined both in terms of a narrow measure based on the credit-to-output ratio, the ratio of capital flows to output, and interest rate spreads, and a broader measure that includes real asset prices as well. An optimal rule, based on minimizing a composite loss function, is also derived. Sensitivity tests, related to the intensity of sterilization, the degree of exchange rate smoothing, and the rule used by the central bank to set the cost of bank borrowing, are also performed, both in terms of the transmission process and the optimal rule."

Different combinations of interest rate and capital requirement rules are evaluated regarding both macroeconomic and financial stability. Several relevant policy implications are drawn from this analysis. First, the implementation of a cyclical capital component as proposed in Basel III, while successful in reducing financial instability when applied alone, loses its efficacy when combined with some interest rate rules. Second, interest rate smoothing is more effective than the other interest rate rules assessed, as it outperforms them concerning financial stability and performs as well as them regarding macroeconomic stability. Finally, there is no long-run tradeoff between monetary and financial stability regarding the sensitiveness of the cyclical capital component to the credit-to-output ratio, as well as the smoothing interest rate parameter."

To address the perspective of market participants as sources of contagion, we propose the impact diffusion influence index, which captures the potential influence of financial institutions on propagating impacts in the network. We unveil the presence of a portion of non-large banking institutions that is consistently more influential than large banks in potentially diffusing impacts throughout the network. Regarding financial system stability, regulators should identify the entities that play these two roles, as they can render the system more risky."

In addition, we verify that the interbank network presents a high disassortative mixing pattern, suggesting that highly connected FIs are frequently connected to others with very few connections. This finding is in line with the fact that interbank networks often show a core-periphery structure. We also investigate the presence of the ``rich-club'' effect on the network and find that it is strongly present in the community comprising the large banking institutions, as they normally form near-clique structures. Since they often play the role of liquidity providers in the interbank market, this interconnectedness effectively endows the network with robustness, as participants that are with liquidity issues can easily substitute counterparties that are liquidity suppliers."

Moreover, the evidence does not confirm some previous international results. We identify that in Brazil there is no coincidence regarding the use of BRL for invoicing and its use for making payments. Yet we find that the main exports denominated in BRL are homogenous goods—sugar and tobacco—suggesting that some bargaining power might remain even if goods are traded in international markets.

We focus on how patterns of services consumption adjust to different levels of income by using the perspective of social expansion as a narrative approach for the Brazilian case in the last decade. We present evidence of nonlinearity in the relation between services consumption and income by using data of the last two versions (2002-2003 and 2008-2009) of the POF-IBGE. The main conclusion follows. Although the population rise of the middle class was remarkably larger than the increase of the richest class, total expenditure and its share on services of the richest class was sufficiently large for this class to outweigh the middle class in accounting for the growth of families’ total expenditure on services. Thus, a policy implication arises. If one assume that Brazil is able to keep in a similar developing path that was experienced in the past decade, which combines expansion of the middle class and the richest class, then unless there are systematic increases in productivity stemming especially from the tradable sector, demand for services rendered to families is likely to be a source of persistent pressures on consumer inflation. The results additionally suggest that, other things equal, demand pressures will stem in special from personal services and transportation since consumption of these IPCA clusters has the particular feature of combining both a high share of total services consumption and a high sensitivity to income rises of Brazilian households in the period."

The motivation is to increase the disclosure of the OTC operations aiming to decrease the probability of crisis. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how regulatory changes in the OTC derivatives market affect the non-financial sector. The Brazilian FX derivatives market provides a natural experiment for the issue: in 2011 the Brazilian government taxed short positions in FX derivatives to reduce the carry trade that was causing the local currency to appreciate. Although Chamon and Garcia (2013) find that this policy helped reduce the incentives to perform carry trade strategies, it could have unintended consequences on other markets. For example, if the banks pass through the extra cost to its clients, this taxation may affect the FX hedges of non-financial firms. This paper investigates whether and how much of the increase in the cost of OTC derivatives is transferred to the non-financial sector. The results indicate that this cost more than doubled for companies exposed to devaluation of the local currency (for instance, importers). Albeit a thorough welfare analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, the findings suggest that this cost increase may be a concern to the extent that it could prevent EMEs firms from hedging their FX positions, as the NDF quotation of some EMEs is high due to the interest rate differentials."

However, government credit concessions continued to expand after the economy recovered. This paper investigates some important features of this expansion using a huge repository of loan contracts between banks and firms, composing an unbalanced panel of almost 1 million firms between 2004 and 2012. We show that earmarked funds have been particularly important for sectors intensive in positive social externalities. However, those sectors were not the main beneficiaries of the strong expansion in earmarked credit observed since the crisis. Our results also show that larger, older and less risky firms have benefited most from the government sponsored credit expansion. Additionally, although a higher access to earmarked credit tends to lead to higher leverage, the effect on investment appears to be insignificant for publicly traded firms. Since interest rates on earmarked loans are lower than the market interest rates, firms with higher access to this type of loan tend to lower cost of debt."

From the viewpoint of determinacy and learnability of rational expectations equilibrium (REE), this paper suggests that a rule that responds to CPI inflation does not significantly increase the central bank's ability to promote the convergence of an economy to a determinate and learnable REE nor improves the speed of this convergence when compared with rules that react to contending inflation measures."

We perform the analysis within the context of a model that integrates data on bilateral exposures in the interbank market with information about the liquidity profile of each financial institution. Asset prices in the model are determined endogenously as a function of the total volume of fire sales, thus creating the possibility that marking to market may trigger new rounds of fire sales and downward asset price spirals. The simulation results show that the Brazilian banking system is robust, as relatively large increases in the delinquency rate lead to only modest losses in the system. We also compute the contribution of each financial institution to systemic losses under severe shocks and find that contributions from medium-sized banks can be significant. However, if shocks become more severe, only large banks will contribute significantly to systemic losses."

Following Patton and Timmermann (2007), we theoretically justify the modeling of forecasts as function of the conditional expectation, based on the optimization problem of individual forecasters. This approach allows us to relax the standard assumption of mean squared error (MSE) loss function and, thus, to obtain optimal forecasts under more general functions. However, different from these authors, we apply our results to a panel of forecasts, in order to construct an optimal (combined) forecast. In this sense, a feasible GMM estimator is proposed to aggregate the information content of each individual forecast and optimally recover the conditional expectation. Our setup can be viewed as a generalization of the three-way forecast error decomposition of Davies and Lahiri (1995); and as an extension of the bias-corrected average forecast of Issler and Lima (2009). A real-time forecasting exercise using the Brazilian Focus survey illustrates the proposed methodology."

Therefore, there is a strong overlapping in data, which is tackled with specific econometric techniques.

 """,2014.,Asymmetric Transmission of a Bank Liquidity Shock,"368, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","We investigate whether banks that receive a positive liquidity shock make up for the reduction in the loan supply by banks that suffer a negative liquidity shock. For identification, we use the exogenous shock to the Brazilian banking system caused by the international turmoil of 2008 that sparked a run on small and medium banks towards the systemically important banks. We find that a reduction in liquidity causes banks to strongly decrease their loan supply, whereas a positive liquidity shock has a small (if any) effect on the loan supply. Our findings are consistent with the theories that predict that borrowers face switching costs, and that agents tend to hold on to liquidity during periods of systemic uncertainty. In addition, we find that the shock causes small and medium companies to obtain less bank financing, compared to large firms, possibly because international and domestic capital markets dry out during the crisis. Our evidence suggests that the asymmetric effect of liquidity on loan supply derives mostly from the extensive, rather than the intensive margin. Nonetheless, because we do not identify the exact mechanism driving bank behavior, we cannot predict under which conditions we would find a similar effect should a new shock occur."

However, some of those items show high persistence, and one certainly does not want to disregard persistent price changes. The non equivalence between volatility and (the lack of) persistence implies that when one excludes volatile items relevant information is likely to be discarded.

However, inflation expectation is only one of its components. In this article we present a simple economic model in order to split the break-even inflation rate in the following fundamental factors: inflation expectation, convexity term, and liquidity and inflation risk premia. Using Brazilian data from January 2006 to September 2013 we evaluate each one of these terms. Inflation expectations are read directly from Focus, a survey conducted by Central Bank of Brazil. In our setup, the convexity term or Jensen's correction is equal to the variance of inflation rate. We report a very small convexity term which is in line with the literature on the subject. Its magnitude is around one basis point, less than the bid-ask spread of Brazilian fixed income bonds. Although there is a significant difference between the trading volume of real and nominal bonds, we find that this liquidity difference is not priced (liquidity premium is not significant). This result is apparently contradictory. However, it is due to the fact that, in Brazil, real bonds are usually held to maturity. Therefore investors do not demand a reward to exposure to liquidity uncertainty which in turn eliminates the relevance of this premium. Finally, we show that the inflation risk premium is nearly zero for short horizons. For long horizons this risk premium is time varying and close related with consumption and stock market volatility, consistent with economic theory."

The conclusions follow. The main stylized fact regarding labor supply is the aging process of the labor force. It lessened the aggregate unemployment rise during the 1990’s by about 20% both in the entire country and in the metropolitan regions and strengthened the unemployment fall by about 30% in Brazil as a whole and by around 20% in the metropolitan regions during the 2000’s. With respect to labor demand, the main stylized facts are that the relative prices have favored the non-tradable sectors, which in addition has shown the most significant rise of the marginal productivity of labor in the last two decades. We argue that it affected sectorial reallocation of employment, which in turn has a negative effect on aggregate unemployment rate conditional on GDP growth. It thus is consistent with the argument which states that employment migrated from tradable sectors towards non-tradable sectors, which are more labor intensive sectors. Besides conventional business cycle changes, which explain the bulk of the actual aggregate unemployment rate developments, the answer to why the aggregate unemployment rate has become so much lower in Brazil is that population has become older and also that the sectorial profile of employment has become increasingly non-tradable."

However, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis has had a significant adverse effect only on the markets in France, Spain and Greece. For the late members, joining EU does not have a uniform effect on stock market efficiency. Our results have important implications for policy makers, investors, risk managers and academics."

 """,2013.,Estimating Strategic Complementarity in a State-Dependent Pricing Model,"341, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","The macroeconomic effects of shocks in models of nominal rigidity depend crucially on the degree of strategic complementarity among price setters. However, the empirical evidence on its magnitude is indirect and ambiguous: the one based on macroeconomic data suggest strong strategic complementarities in price-setting, which seems to be contradicted by some recent studies based on micro data. In this paper we estimate directly the degree of strategic complementarity based on individual price data underlying the CPI-FGV from Brazil during the 1996-2006 period, benefiting from large amount of macroeconomic variation in Brazilian sample. Our identification strategy is to infer the degree of strategic complementarity from the relation between the frictionless optimal price and its macroeconomic determinants. We assume that firms follow an asymmetric Ss pricing rule, which allows us to relate the price discrepancy (and the conditional probability of adjustment) to the change in the frictionless optimal price since the last adjustment date. As a consequence, assumptions for non-observable shocks lead to a relation between the probability of adjustments and the conditional mean changes in the frictionless optimal price since the last adjustment. This relation allows us to directly estimate the degree of strategic complementarity from the occurrence of price adjustments. The results, which are based on individual price changes and not on macro effects, indicate a substantial degree of strategic complementarity, contributing to reconcile micro and macro based evidence."

We depart from the conventional method of VAR analysis to estimate unanticipated monetary shocks and instead we use a combination of other methods. We first identify the Taylor rule that best describes the reaction of both central banks and then we test both forward looking linear and nonlinear models concluding that a Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive (LSTAR) forward looking model of the Taylor rule best describes the US FED Funds rate while a linear Taylor rule with the inclusion of a dummy variable best describes the reaction of the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB). We then use in-sample forecast errors in order to derive or identify the unexpected monetary shocks for both countries. In line with Cover (1992), we use these shocks to explore any asymmetries in the conduct of monetary policy on the growth rate of real industrial production. We also find asymmetries between anticipated and unanticipated monetary shocks as well as between effects of positive and negative shocks."

Using quarterly data for the period 1999Q2 – 2012Q4, we estimate the NAIRU, NAICU and the output gap incorporating a more comprehensive economic structure in the Kalman filter. The results suggest that the labor market and industry variables have significant impacts on inflation, ie , the unemployment gap is the relevant demand variable to explain inflation in the nontradable sector, while the capacity utilization gap is important for inflation of tradable goods. There is evidence of substantial reduction in the NAIRU in recent years, reaching about 6.3 % by the end of 2012. Moreover, our results suggest that the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU since mid-2010.

Banks' decisions on risky retail loan concessions are based on borrowers' capacity to settle their debt with labor income. We also introduce frictions in banks' optimal choices of balance sheet composition to better reproduce banks' strategic reactions to changes in funding costs, in risk perception and in the regulatory environment. The model is able to reproduce not only price effects from macroprudential policies, but also quantity effects. The model is estimated with Brazilian data using Bayesian techniques. Unanticipated changes in reserve requirements have important quantitative effects, especially on banks' optimal asset allocation and on the choice of funding. This result holds true even for required reserves deposited at the central bank that are remunerated at the base rate. Changes in required core capital substantially impact the real economy and banks' balance sheet. When there is a lag between announcements and actual implementation of increased capital requirement ratios, agents immediately engage in anticipatory behavior. Banks immediately start to retain dividends so as to smooth the impact of higher required capital on their assets, more particularly on loans. The impact on the real economy also shifts to nearer horizons. Announcements that allow the new regulation on required capital to be anticipated also improve banks' risk positions, since banks achieve higher capital adequacy ratios right after the announcement and throughout the impact period. The effects of regulatory changes to risk weights on bank assets are not constrained to impact the segment whose risk was reassessed. We compare the model responses with those generated by models with collateral constraints traditionally used in the literature. The choice of collateral constraint is found to have important implications for the transmission of shocks to the economy."

 """,2013.,Time Series under Present-Value-Model Short- and Long-run Co-movement Restrictions,"330, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper has two original contributions. First, we show that PV relationships entail a weak-form SCCF restriction, as in Hecq et al. (2006) and in Athanasopoulos et al. (2011), and implies a polynomial serial correlation common feature relationship (Cubadda and Hecq, 2001). These represent short-run restrictions on the dynamic multivariate systems, something that has not been discussed before. Our second contribution relates to forecasting multivariate time series that are subject to PVM restrictions, which has a wide application in macroeconomics and finance. We benefit from previous work showing the benefits for forecasting when the short-run dynamics of the system is constrained. The reason why appropriate common-cycle restrictions improve forecasting is because it finds linear combinations of the first differences of the data that cannot be forecast by past information. This embeds natural exclusion restrictions preventing the estimation of useless parameters, which would otherwise contribute to the increase of forecast variance with no expected reduction in bias. We applied the techniques discussed in this paper to data known to be subject to PV restrictions: the online series maintained and updated by Robert J. Shiller at https://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm. We focus on three different data sets. The first includes the levels of interest rates with long and short maturities, the second includes the level of real price and dividend for the S&P composite index, and the third includes the logarithmic transformation of prices and dividends. Our exhaustive investigation of six different multivariate models reveals that better forecasts can be achieved when restrictions are applied to them. Specifically, cointegration restrictions, and cointegration and weak-form SCCF rank restrictions, as well as all the set of theoretical restrictions embedded in the PVM."

I show that the divine coincidence holds only when the inflation rate is stabilized at exactly zero. Even a small deviation of trend (steady-state) inflation from zero generates a policy trade-off. I demonstrate this result using the model's non-linear equilibrium conditions to avoid any bias arising from log-linearization. When the model is log-linearized in line with common practice, a non-zero trend inflation gives rise to what I call an endogenous trend inflation cost-push shock. This shock enters the New Keynesian Phillips curve whenever the steady state level of inflation (trend inflation) deviates from zero. To assess the impact of trend inflation, I derive the welfare-based loss function under trend inflation and characterize optimal policy rules. Optimal policy is able to reduce the volatility of inflation and the output gap but can never fully stabilize them under non-zero trend inflation."

As background for the analysis, the second part provides a review of financial systems in MICs (with a focus on the role of bank credit), the extent to which exposure to capital flows affect economic stability in these countries, and the link between excessive credit growth and financial crises. The third and fourth parts review the main features and evidence on the performance of IT regimes in MICs. The fifth part discusses a number of challenges that IT faces, including fiscal dominance, fear or floating, imperfect credibility, and with respect to an explicit financial stability objective assigned to monetary policy. The issue of complementarity between macroprudential regulation and monetary policy, in the context of an “integrated” IT (or IIT) regime, is taken up next. The nature of monetary policy rules in an IIT regime, and their practical implementation, is also discussed. Our analysis suggests that there are robust arguments to support the view that in an IIT regime monetary policy should react in a state contingent fashion to a credit gap measure – and possibly to the real exchange rate – to address the time-series dimension of systemic risk. However, monetary policy and macroprudential policy are largely complementary instruments. They must be calibrated jointly, in the context of macroeconomic models that account for the type of credit market imperfections observed in MICs and for the fact that macroprudential regimes may affect in substantial ways the monetary transmission mechanism."

In comparison to the set of untargeted loans, the increase was at least of 13%. On the other hand, evidence on increase of spreads also for loans whose risk weights have not been altered is not robust. Finally, this paper shows that the later withdrawal of the regulatory capital measure was associated, similarly, to lower spreads charged on auto loans whose risk weights have decreased. Nevertheless, when measured relatively, this reduction in spreads was smaller than the original increase."

The official supply of currency swaps to the market provides an alternative for traders that demand foreign currency for financial (speculative or hedging) rather than transactional reasons, and thus affects the demand for foreign currency and its price.

We follow the Rochet and Wright (2010) approach, but assuming a credit card system without a no-surcharge rule or any type of price differentiation disincentive. In a Hotelling competition framework at the retailers level, the competitive equilibrium prices are computed assuming that the store credit provided by the retailer is less cost efficient than the one provided by the credit card. In accordance with the literature, we obtain that the interchange fee becomes neutral if we eliminate the no-surcharge rule, when the interchange fee loses its ability to distort the individual consumer’s decisions displacing the aggregated consumers’ welfare from its maximum. We prove that the average price obtained under price differentiation is smaller than the single retail price under the no-surcharge rule, despite the retailer’s margins being the same in both scenarios. Furthermore, we show how some cross subsidies are eliminated when price differentiation is allowed. In addition, we introduce menu costs to prove that there is a threshold value for the interchange fee such that price differentiation is equilibrium if that fee is above this value. The threshold may be interpreted as an endogenous cap for the interchange fee fixed by the credit card industry. Finally we conclude that, even with menu costs associated to price differentiation, the consumers’ welfare can be greater in the price differentiated equilibrium than in the single price equilibrium under the non-surcharge rule."

We estimate that a 25% real variation in the price of these five commodities moves the fundamental long-run real exchange rate by about 10%. Changes in interest rate differentials do not explain short or long term movements in the exchange rate during this period. Furthermore, we find that deviations of the real effective exchange rate from the long run equilibrium level have an estimated half-life of approximately 8 months. The growing exports of oil & fuel and of iron ores, as well as the important oil discoveries in the pre-salt layer, suggest that commodity prices will continue to influence the value of the Real in future."

The decomposition method is novel and stems from a vector autoregressive model of the endogenous variables where the different channels are represented. Our results are consistent with the view that QE policies had a positive effect on growth but also had other significant spillover effects on the Brazilian economy. These effects were mostly transmitted through “excessive” capital inflows that led to exchange rate appreciation, stock market price increases and a credit boom. The effect on inflation was less robust, mitigated by currency appreciation and dependent on whether global activity reacts more strongly to quantitative easing."

However, factors other than credit risk, such as the time a loan remains in the NPL condition, the distribution of defaults over time within a certain vintage, the growth rate of the loan portfolio and its term to maturity, may influence its dynamics. Moreover, accounting differences related to recognition and definition of an event of default makes it difficult to compare this metric across different countries. In this paper, we propose an alternative metric to assess the dynamics of credit risk in the loan portfolio. Based on a theoretical portfolio, we develop an analytical model in order to estimate the weighted average of lifetime default ratios of all vintages where the weight is assigned based on the contribution of each vintage to the current stock of loans. We call it implied NPL ratio, which consists of a transformation that adjusts the observed NPL ratio for the effects of changes in the portfolio growth rate and in its average term to maturity, and also takes into account differences in the default distribution across time and the amount of time a past due loan remains in the balance sheet. The results of applying this transformation to the three most relevant types of loans to households in Brazil (auto loans, housing financing and payroll-deducted loans) demonstrate that (a) the implied NPL ratio was a good forecast of the portfolio lifetime default; (b) changes in the components mentioned above affected the dynamics of the NPL ratio and therefore compromised the assessment of credit risk based on this metric (c) the analysis of differences in the evolution of NPL and INPL gives rise to important insights regarding the dynamics of credit risk."

The trend of the post-crisis is a macro-prudential regulation in order to smooth out economic cycles and mitigate systemic risk. Accordingly, Adrian & Brunnermeier (2011) propose a measure of systemic risk - the CoVaR. Basically, the CoVaR of an institution represents the value at risk of the financial system conditional on the institution being under distress. They also define the institution's contribution to systemic risk as the difference between CoVaR conditional on the institution being under distress and the CoVaR in the median state of the institution. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the application of the CoVaR measure in the Brazilian banking system. The results for the Brazilian market indicate that: i) VaR is a poor measure to capture the systemic risk of an institution; ii) although larger institutions have less individual risks, they offer higher systemic risks; iii) some smaller institutions are also among the ones offering higher systemic risks; iv) on average, one unit of a larger institution individual risk increases more the systemic risk than one unit of a small institution individual risk; v) on average, the systemic risk is lower for public financial institutions. Furthermore, the findings (ii) and (iv) indicate that, on average, institutions with higher individual risk have minor marginal contributions to the systemic risk."

Promptly identifying bank distress and contagion issues is of great importance to the regulators. This paper proposes a methodology that can be used additionally to the standard methods of bank supervision or the new ones proposed to be implemented. By this, one can reveal the degree of banks’ connectedness and thus identify “core” instead of just “big” banks. Core banks are central in the network in the sense that they are shown to be crucial for network supervision. Core banks can be used as gauges of bank distress over a sub-network and promptly raise a red flag so that the central bank can effectively and swiftly focus on the corresponding neighborhood of financial institutions. In this paper we demonstrated the proposed scheme using as an example the asset returns variable. The method may and should be used with alternative variables as well."

The financial crisis negatively affected the supply of loans by foreign banks, even more intensively and longer than domestic private banks. Nevertheless, in the post-crisis period, namely from the third quarter of 2010 until the end of 2011, the growth rate of foreign banks’ lending was larger than those of other banks. The interest rates that foreign banks charge in some types of loans are, on average, lower than those charged by domestic banks. In the currency derivatives market, foreign banks play an important role in providing such instruments, especially for the non-financial sector and for institutional investors. The results show that, during the crisis and especially in the post-crisis period, domestic private banks reduced their share in such markets.

Moreover, the close-to-close volatility is often less than the median of the volatility distribution perceived by investors while the open-to-open volatility is greater than that statistic.

 """,2012.,Sailing through the Global Financial Storm: Brazil's recent experience with monetary and macroprudential policies to lean against the financial cycle and deal with systemic risks,"290, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","Brazil sailed well through the global financial storm, using counter-cyclical policies to engineer its fast V-shaped recovery in 2010. In order to deal with inflationary pressures arising from its strong recovery, after the peak of the crisis, it used standard aggregate demand management instruments (tight fiscal and monetary policies). Brazil had also to deal with the post-QE global environment of excess liquidity in 2010-2011 where excessive capital inflows were exacerbating domestic credit growth with potentially destabilizing effects for price and financial stability. In that front, Brazil maintained and strengthened its strong financial sector regulation and supervision to continue to ensure financial stability, in particular, using a set of macroprudential instruments. While combining monetary and macroprudential instruments to lean against the financial cycle, the Central Bank of Brazil has always made clear that macroprudential measures are not a substitute for monetary policy action and are primarily geared at addressing financial stability risks. In fact, many policy makers after the global financial crisis seem to see now a complementarity between macroprudential measures and monetary policy. Accordingly, the (new) separation principle seems to evolve into using two instruments (the central bank’s base rate and a set of macroprudential tools) to address two objectives (the inflation target and a composite set of financial stability indicators). Brazil’s recent experience with monetary and macroprudential policies is a successful example of this new approach. More time and other countries’ experiences are needed to assess properly if this policy option can be generalized and replicated with similar results elsewhere."

In addition, systemic risk in the Brazilian credit market is investigated given its crucial role as main financial stability driver. Finally, synthetic indicators of systemic risk are used to monitor financial stability. The link between systemic risk and synthetic indicators and/or well-correlated proxies (e.g., a credit-to-GDP gap) allows the calculation of the probability of disruption of the financial system across its time dimension. Therefore, if a Financial Stability Committee and/or the prudential regulator define its tolerance level for “financial stability” as a threshold measured by this probability of disruption, it might have the capability of determining the precise moment when it should strengthen its set of adequate macroprudential responses and policies."

So, the empirical observation may be explained by the tolerance with excess of liquidity in the system. This motivation for this tolerance is discussed in this work. Furthermore, it is also discussed that the central bank may administrate the volatility of the differential between Selic and its objective.

Here, we assess the role of asset price misalignments in monetary policy in an adaptive learning context. Our model first extends Bullard and Mitra (2002), including an additional role for asset prices. From the point of view of the E-Stability criterion, commonly used in the learning literature, we find that a response to stock prices is not desirable under both a forward expectations policy rule and an interest rate rule responding to contemporaneous values. Heterogeneous beliefs about the dynamics of asset price fluctuations, inflation and the output gap are introduced and we also evaluate an optimal monetary policy rule including a weight on asset prices. Overall we find that the Taylor principle remains important over all interest rate rules analysed and that central banks should act cautiously when considering the introduction of stock prices in monetary policy."

We find that the effect of USD sales by end-users on the BRL/USD was much stronger on days in which the BCB did not intervene in the spot foreign exchange market. The regressions suggest that a 1% appreciation of the Real would have required the sale of 2.0 bn USD by final customers on days in which the Central Bank refrained from intervening. This compares to required sales of 5.5 bn USD on days in which the Central Bank was present in the market. This large effect, in spite of the fact that the median intervention amounted to only 140 mn USD, can be interpreted as evidence for the indirect damping channel. Furthermore, we find that order flows coming from outside of the financial sector have a (considerably) stronger effect on the BRL/USD exchange rate than those coming from financial customers. We argue that some studies may have failed to find significant effects of BCB interventions due to a problem of reverse causality, as in a regime of discretionary interventions the decision to intervene is often taken during trading hours."

Based on quantile regression model and on the comparison with conventional models (least squares and fixed effects), the work provides better understanding of capital structure to reveal the available information on quantiles. This was not observed in Brazilian previous studies that analyzed only the general trend of the determinant's parameters. According to the results, we conclude that there exists a significant statistical influence of the quantile on the estimated coefficients, i.e., the effects of the determinants change depending on the quantile. This can be theoretically justified by bankruptcy and agency costs relative to the leverage of firms, hence, relative to each quantile. Therefore, the predicted effects of main theories of capital structure, pecking order and trade-off, apply, depending on the determinant, type of debt and quantile analyzed. Nevertheless the results of the variables size and profitability show that the pecking order becomes stronger as the quantile increases."

This paper uses the Liu et all (2007) approach to estimate the option-implied risk-neutral densities from the Brazilian Real/US Dollar exchange rate distribution. We then compare the RND with actual exchange rates, on a monthly basis, in order to estimate the relative risk-aversion of investors and also obtain a real-world density for the exchange rate. We are the first to calculate relative risk-aversion and the option-implied real world Density for an emerging market currency. Our empirical application uses a sample of exchange-traded Brazilian Real currency options from 1999 to 2011. The RND is estimated using a Mixture of Two Log-Normals distribution and then the real-world density is obtained by means of the Liu et al. (2007) parametric risk-transformations. Our estimated value of the relative risk aversion parameter is around 2.7, which is in line with other articles that have estimated this parameter for the Brazilian Economy. Our out-of-sample evaluation results showed that the RND has some ability to forecast the Brazilian Real exchange rate. However, when we incorporate the risk aversion into RND in order to obtain a Real-world density, the outof- sample performance improves substantially. Therefore, we would suggest not using the “pure” RND, but rather taking into account risk aversion in order to forecast the Brazilian Real exchange rate."

The early warning estimates of crisis likelihood, severity and amplification dynamics provide new stylized evidence on the externality view. The most relevant and statistically significant conditioning states were found to be international risk aversion, net foreign asset position, international reserves and overvaluation indicators. An interesting rule of thumb that emerged from the empirical estimates is that capital flow taxes should be proportional to the square of the likelihood of an external crisis."

A sudden flood in capital flows generates an expansion in credit and activity, and asset price pressures. Countercyclical regulation, in the form of a Basel III-type rule based on real credit gaps, is effective at promoting macroeconomic stability (defined in terms of the volatility of a weighted average of inflation and the output gap) and financial stability (defined in terms of the volatility of a composite index of the nominal exchange rate and house prices). However, because the gain in terms of reduced volatility may exhibit diminishing returns, a countercyclical regulatory rule may need to be supplemented by other, more targeted, macroprudential instruments."

This lack of empirical backing for the predictions of standard open economy models that, for instance, combine the UIP condition with rational expectations (as in Dornbusch (1976)) persists irrespective of whether we use the US Dollar or effective exchange rates, whether interest rate changes are anticipated or not, whether changes in the policy rate that were followed by exchange rate intervention are excluded or whether ""contaminated"" events are dropped from the analysis. We argue that it is difficult to attribute this stronger version of the exchange rate puzzle to fiscal dominance, as similar results are obtained in the case of Chile - a country that has had the highest possible short-term credit rating since 1997 and a debt/GDP ratio below 10%. Indeed, in Chile a 100 b.p. hike leads to a 2.2 to 2.6% devaluation of the Peso on impact."

In Brazil, however, there has been a great deal of discussion concerning the amount of earnings of financial institutions operating in the country, centered on the argument that such earnings are too large, becoming an excessive burden to the wealth-producing sector. For this reason, several studies have evaluated the structure, the evolution, and the determinants of banking spread, which is taken as the main variable responsible for the supposedly abnormal earnings. From the methodological viewpoint, these studies have concentrated in investigating the ex-ante banking spread related to operations with free resources and they have utilized macroeconomic factors as independent variables. The present study aims at identifying variables determining the ex-post banking spread, privileging explanatory variables intrinsic to the institutions, in other words, microeconomic. The extant literature on determinants of banking ex-post spread in Brazil presents a single previous paper, which presents poor results due to a problem of micronumerosity. To avoid such problem, our study utilizes data of balance sheets of banking institutions with operating credit portfolios from January 2000 to October 2009. Using a dynamic panel-data regression model, we test nine hypotheses and we find that the level of ex-post banking spread has relationships which are significant and: (i) positive with the credit portfolio risk; (ii) negative with the relative participation of the institutions in the credit market. On the other hand, we could not find statistically significant relationships between the level of ex-post banking spread and: the level of coverage of administrative expenses by revenues from services rendered; the origin of the institutions’ controlling capital, i.e. national versus foreign and state-owned versus private; the economy’s basic interest rate; the volatility of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange stock index."

Stress-testing exercises on the Brazilian household sector at the one-quarter horizon indicate that unemployment rate distress produces the most harmful effect, whereas distressed inflation and distressed interest rate show higher impacts at longer periods. Determining which of the two stress-testing approaches perceives the scenarios more severely depends on the type of comparison employed.

The main determinants of the extent of inflationary pass-through of the depreciations (appreciations) are the cyclical component of output, the extent of initial overvaluation of the real exchange rate (RER), the initial rate of inflation, and the degree of openness of the economy. The paper finds that the pass-through coefficients increase the larger is the horizon measured, with its peak at 12-months. It also finds that RER misalignment is the most important determinant of inflation for emerging markets while the initial inflation is the most important variable for developed countries. Using the estimated model, the paper predicts somewhat higher inflation than actually observed in several well-known large depreciation cases, even if one takes into account existing measures of exchange rate expectations. This suggests that policy makers should use caution when using past models to predict future inflation in the aftermath of large depreciations."

We first provide suggestive evidence that inspected firms employing informal workers are more likely to exit following a labor inspection, compared to firms never penalized for such infractions. Next, we apply a difference-in-differences framework using firms not yet penalized for “unregistered employee” infractions as the control group to estimate the effect of labor inspections on firm-level outcomes. We find that formal employment and formal labor hiring experience a positive spike in the year of the inspection, indicating the formalization of unregistered employees. However, formal employment declines steadily over time, dropping nearly 60% by the fourth year after inspection. Among firms with active bank relationships, revenue falls sharply by about 24% over the same period. We also observe a persistent reduction in the outstanding loan amount and significant rise in the non-performing loan ratio. The average formal wage drops by about 1% in the year of inspection, but returns to pre-inspection levels in later years. Our findings are consistent with firms reducing their overall labor usage due to higher labor costs, which arise from increased compliance with labor regulations following a labor inspection."

The analysis is based on a dynamic stochastic model with imperfect credit markets. Macroeconomic (financial) stability is defined in terms of the volatility of nominal income (real house prices). Numerical experiments show that even if monetary policy can react strongly to inflation deviations from target, combining a credit-augmented interest rate rule and a Basel III-type countercyclical capital regulatory rule may be optimal for promoting overall economic stability. The greater the degree of interest rate smoothing, and the stronger the policymaker’s concern with macroeconomic stability, the larger is the sensitivity of the regulatory rule to credit growth gaps."

Our empirical strategy allows us to disentangle the too big to fail benefit from the other features continuously related to size. Our unique database allows us to observe the behavior of uninsured deposits and of different types of holders of certificates of deposits, such as individuals, institutional investors and non-financial corporations. Taken together, our results are consistent with the idea that depositors ran from the smaller banks to the largest banks because they believed the largest banks were too big to fail. We also find that institutional investors had an important role in inducing the behavior of other depositors during the crisis: banks that had relatively more deposits of institutional investors ex-ante suffered more deposit outflows throughout the crisis."

We show that GDP growth revisions are substantial, with a 0.7 p.p. mean absolute revision for the quarter-over-quarter growth, although the revisions become less important for four-quarter changes. To assess output gap revisions, we use four methods to estimate the output gap: Hodrick-Prescott filter, linear trend, quadratic trend, and Harvey-Clark model of unobservable components. The output gap revisions are substantial in all methods, with absolute mean revisions between 0.6 p.p. and 2.3 p.p. In three out of the four methods, the revisions implied changes in the output gap sign in 30 percent or more of the cases. In general, both the GDP data revision and the sample increase are relevant sources of output gap revisions."

Evidence is in favor of the home field advantage hypothesis since foreign banks are less cost efficient than their domestic counterparts. Furthermore, the agency theory hypothesis is not accepted as state-owned banks are more cost efficient than private banks. This could be due to: 1. the number of state-owned banks was reduced in the last years and only more efficient banks are left in the Brazilian banking system, and 2. state-owned banks hold very large public servants payroll accounts and therefore have an important advantage. Further research could exploit profit efficiency as private banks may have higher profit efficiency."

Given a liquidity constraint that can incorporate these factors, there is a failure probability Pf that the constraint will not hold, resulting in a value loss for the bank, represented by a stochastic failure loss . By assuming that bankers are risk neutral in their decision about the size of the liquidity cushion, the economic profit less the possible losses due to the lack of liquidity is optimized, resulting in a short-term asset allocation model that integrates market, credit and operational risks in the liquidity management of banks. Even though a general approach is suggested through simulation, I provide a closed form solution for Pf , under some simplifying assumptions, that may be useful for research and supervision purposes as an indicator of the liquidity management adequacy in the banking system. I also suggest an extreme value theory approach for the estimation of , departing from other liquidity management models that use a penalty rate over the demand of cash that exceeds the availability of liquid resources. The model was applied to Brazilian banks data resulting in gains over the optimization without liquidity considerations that are robust under several tests, giving empirical indications that the model may have a relevant impact on the value creation in banks."

This outcome, contrary to conventional wisdom, is predicted by the weak hypothesis."

When the European options are considered, the model developed is based on Monte Carlo Simulations, taking into consideration the joint simulation of the underwriter’s price. The results of this model are compared with the premiums estimated by Margrabe (1978) and Kirk (1995) formulas. Additionally, the sensibility of the premiums relative to changes in some inputs parameters was analyzed, contributing for the correct understanding of these derivatives. When the american options are considered, the model developed consists in an adaption of the Least Square Monte Carlo (LSMC) method developed by Longstaff e Schwartz (2001), so as to contemplate the multidimensional case. The results presented by this model were then compared with that presented by two other models, based on pyramidal lattices, developed by Rubinstein (1994) and Brandimarte (2006). Besides comparing the results presented by these three models, the sensibility of the premiums relative to changes in some inputs parameters was analyzed, confirming the consistence of the results presented. It’s important to note that, different from the pyramidal lattices, the adaption of the LSMC model has the advantage to allow the extension for three or more underwriters."

 """,2008.,Foreign Banks' Entry and Departure: The Recent Brazilian Experience (1996-2006),"164, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","There is a broad literature documenting the recent trend towards a larger foreign banking presence in both mature and emerging markets. Less documented are the few situations where banking internationalization has contracted. Brazil is one such case. After a large-scale entry in the late 90s, foreign banks have retreated, being absorbed by their domestic competitors. This paper examines these opposite trends and associates de-internationalization mainly with lower relative profitability of foreign firms. Bank-level panel data investigates the determinants of earnings and costs according to ownership, providing evidence that greater foreign presence contributed to curb domestic banks?costs, but not their profitability. This assessment is consistent with widespread evidence that internationalization forces local banks to operate more efficiently."

 """,2008.,Searching for the Natural Rate of Unemployment in a Large Relative Price Shocks' Economy: the Brazilian Case,"163, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","This paper contributes to fill the large existing gap in the literature on the Brazilian natural rate of unemployment. It reveals not only that the correlation between inflation and unemployment has changed radically since the stabilisation of the economy but, more surprisingly, that it has become positive in the recent past. In other words, there has apparently been no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. However, this fact is due to – and highlights – the paramount importance of supply shocks in recent inflation dynamics in Brazil. The paper then shows that the exchange rate has been the major source of shocks to inflation, even though it is not enough to explain the magnitude and persistence of those shocks. Part of the answer comes from the large and wide effects produced by privatisation on the price dynamics in Brazil. The evidence presented here suggests that the Brazilian natural rate of unemployment has been constant since 1996. Despite the high degree of uncertainty involved in natural rate estimations, point estimates seem to lie somewhere between the 7.4%–8.5% range. The paper also sheds light on why real interest rates have been so high for extended periods of time in Brazil, a feature that has puzzled many economists. Finally, it calls to attention that one important core inflation measure in Brazil has not been able to capture underlying inflation properly and, therefore, has to be used with caution."

Stock returns of non-financial firms were also affected by these changes, suggesting that in some cases, reserve requirements on time deposits and transaction accounts served as a non-neutral instrument of monetary or fiscal policy in Brazil."

The Harmful Effects of Inflation Uncertainty in Brazil,"157, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","After being one the fastest growing countries in the world during the 1940-80 period, with an average growth rate of 6.8%, Brazil has experienced a severe growth slowdown since the 1980s, which coincided with the steep rise in inflation as of 1980. At the same time, real investment rates have plunged, shrinking around nine percentage points just in the 1980s. Moreover, they were unable to recover their 1989 level afterwards. This is unexpected as several pro-growth reforms took place since 1990, such as trade liberalization, privatization and economic stabilization. More strikingly, in the ten years following the stabilization of the economy, real investment rates have being at their lowest levels for, at least, fifty years. One major factor that could help explaining this dismal behavior is inflation uncertainty, which have remained high despite much lower inflation since 1994. Indeed, inflation uncertainty is at the root as many types of uncertainties faced by firms. For example, it also means uncertainty about future interest rates and demand. This work aims both at uncovering the main determinants that have driven M&E investment in Brazil since 1980 and testing the link between inflation uncertainty and investment. The evidence strongly suggests that inflation uncertainty has been an important investment deterrent in Brazil, both in the short and long runs. Moreover, its effects were found to be asymmetric. Also, despite the limited role played by price variables in empirical studies of investment, the real interest rate, itself importantly affected by inflation uncertainty and inflation risk premium, seems to be another key factor in explaining low investment rates in Brazil."

In this case, an over-the-target inflation becomes more likely. The central bank is considered weak when favorable state of nature is required for the target to be achieved. On the other hand, if a weak central bank opts for less ambitious goals, namely lower degree of transparency and higher target level, it may avoid confidence crises and ensure a unique equilibrium for the expected inflation. Moreover, even after ruling out the possibility of confidence crises, less ambitious goals may be desirable in order to attain higher credibility and hence a better coordination of expectations. Conversely, a low target level and a high central bank transparency are desirable whenever the economy has strong fundamentals and the target can be fulfilled in many states of nature."

This paper tries to improve even more the precision gains obtained by IS over the same simplified CreditMetrics' model. For this purpose, IS is here combined with Descriptive Sampling (DS), another simulation technique which has proved to be a powerful variance reduction procedure. IS combined with DS was successful in obtaining more precise results for credit risk estimates than its standard form."

The measurement employs the R/S classic analysis, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and Generalized Hurst exponents, upon a 1008-observation window, which moves along the data. We obtain as a result, the effects of the 1992 European financial crises on the measurements of the long-range dependency phenomenon. After the crisis the returns of this futures contract showed no signs of the long-range memory, which existed before the crisis. The volatility presented moderate long-range memory the whole time. We also test for long-memory in European currencies inside the European Monetary System and find evidence of moderate long memory, which suggests that being inside the EMS increases predictability."

We use an adaptation of the LSV Herding measure and calculate this measure for a sample of 9 emerging markets over the period 2000-2005. Our overall mean, 4.75, although is lower than previous studies with emerging equity markets during the late 1990’s, still indicates the presence of herding behavior. Therefore we have evidence to support the hypothesis of herding decreasing from the period 1995-2000 to 2000-2005. However, the difference of the sample characteristics between our study and the previous ones may be the responsible for these results. The two main differences on our sample is that we use country allocation, instead of stock allocation (as in Bowe and Domuta (2004) and Kim and Wei (2002)), and the all universe of foreign investors, instead of only funds as in Borensztein and Gelos (2003). In this way an alternative hypothesis would be that funds herd in a higher intensity than the other types of investors. Regarding the effects of Herding on the risk measures, our results are mixed. Our regression analysis showed no effects of the Herding on the volatility, which is one of the main risk measures used by investors. However, the fat tails of equity return’s distribution may be caused by this herding behavior of foreigners. Further studies should address this issue in more in depth since the fat tails may be due to herding of other types of investors also."

While Brazilian per capita GDP was roughly 15% of the U.S. per capita GDP in 1950, it achieved 30% in 1980. However, since then, Brazil has been growing at small or even negative rates, and in 1998 its per capita GDP was back to 20% of the U.S.. This paper investigates possible reasons for what is usually called the Brazilian ""lost decades"", based on an accounting procedure applied to a simple neoclassical model as in Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2006). After decomposing four types of shocks (productivity, labor, capital and income accounting), each of them is fed back into the model and the predicted and actual data are compared. It is shown that, for the case of the Brazilian ""lost decades"", productivity shocks seem to be the most important factor in explaining the behavior of output and consumption during the eighties, and labor shocks are the main responsible for the behavior of the variables of interest during the nineties. Increased barriers to competition and the changes imposed by the 1988 Constitution in labor markets are possible explanations for the results."

The results indicate that the short-run pass-through is higher when the economy is growing faster, when the exchange rate depreciates above some threshold and when exchange rate volatility is lower.

Based on broadly accepted assumptions on the behavior of economic agents, we show that firms’ competition can lead to the adoption of sticky prices as a sub-game perfect equilibrium strategy to optimally deal with consumers’ risk aversion, even if firms have no adjustment costs. To this end, we build a model economy based on consumption centers with several complete markets and relax some traditional assumptions used in standard monetary policy models by assuming that households have imperfect information about the inefficient time-varying cost shocks faced by the .rms. Furthermore, we assume that the timing of events is such that, at every period, consumers have access to the actual prices prevailing in the market only after choosing a particular consumption center. Since such choices under uncertainty may decrease the expected utilities of risk-averse consumers, competitive firms adopt some degree of price stickiness in order to minimize the price uncertainty and ""attract more customers""."

This article addresses changes in the analytical framework employed to track the inflation dynamics, specifically the relevance of an explicit target for inflation. A New-Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) is derived incorporating indexation not only to past inflation but also to inflation targets, generalizing the Woodford (2003) hybrid curve. In our modeling, firms that do not optimally set their prices in a given period adjust them only by indexing their previous prices to a weighted average of the inflation target and lagged inflation. In such a framework, the impact of inflation targets on agents' decisions regarding the supply side can be analytically measured by the parameter associated to the inflation target. It is shown that inflation target affects the welfare-based monetary policy objective function by penalizing deviations of actual inflation from target instead of from zero. This result establishes the micro foundation basis for ad-hoc loss functions as indicated in traditional literature. Therefore, the inflation target also affects the optimal target criterion. We also present a microfounded specification to model inflation expectations, and conclude that when firms attribute a high weight to the government's inflation target when setting their own prices, exchange rate and demand shocks are unable to alter significantly inflation expectations. Such a result gives some light to empirical ad hoc assessment conducted in traditional literature. Our empirical evidence shows that even after major shocks, the target ability of anchoring inflation has been restored. Although not formally tested, such a fact followed the monetary authorities' firm commitment to meet the inflation targets, reinforced by the government's necessary support through a consistent fiscal policy."

Empirical tests showed that, initially, during inflow phase, countries had experienced strong GDP growth; but then, with reversal, GDP contracted steeply. Inflows helped to stabilize inflation while, for economies with less flexible exchange regimes, reversals forced some of them to let their currency float, causing sharp depreciation and acceleration of inflation.

After setting the expectations right, one of the results achieved indicates that the optimal inflation under any type of central banker is higher than that obtained in the original paper, suggesting that the time inconsistency phenomenon plays a more important role in explaining an inflationary bias than originally interpreted by Walsh (2000). However, if society organizes itself towards shorter tenure wage contracts, inflation will be lower. The results obtained for the output gap of the economy also differ from those achieved by Walsh in the sense that a central banker who is highly committed to previously announced inflation targets will have more opportunities to generate output growth above equilibrium rates and still commit. Finally, the stability of the premises regarding the contractual structure of the economy proposed by Walsh is tested under a game theoretic approach. The outcome of the test is that stability can be guaranteed only under strong assumptions and high symmetry in the sectoral distribution of firms. By using a social welfare function in which price surprises in any direction lead to welfare loss, the results indicate that society is better off by choosing longer tenure wage contracts, moving away from shorter tenure ones, at the cost of higher inflation."

In these models, each observation of the past can be a possible scenery and for each scenery there is a price for the asset, what represents an implicit assumption that the returns are identically and independently distributed. The violation of this assumption is the main criticism to these models, evidenced by the existence of volatility clusters in the financial series that can cause an inconsistency in the value at risk estimates. This work applies a solution for this problem incorporating the volatility to the historical model for the value at risk estimate of stock options in the Brazilian market. The obtained results show that, during the studied period, the methodology presents good performance for a VaR estimation of 99% probability. For the 98% and 95% probabilities, an overestimation of the VaR is verified."

We analyze the single and double-window historical model, the exponential smoothing model (EWMA) and a hybrid approach that combines features of both models. The results suggest that the Basel model is inadequate to the Brazilian market, exhibiting a large number of exceptions. The model of the Brazilian legislation has no exceptions, though generating higher capital requirements than other internal models based on VaR, even with the changes introduced by Circular no. 3,229. In general, VaR-based models perform better and result in less capital allocation than the standardized approach model applied in Brazil."

This characterization allows us to numerically compute the endogenously determined steady state key relationship, namely the primary surplus aggregate output as well as the debt-product ratio among other variables, as functions of the monetary and fiscal policy parameters chosen by the government of the model economy. The adopted model introduces a transaction technology, which allows us to obtain a monetary equilibrium at steady state. This economy differs from the one used by Ljungqvist and Sargent (2000) for it considers an open economy with accumulation and production. The main result has shown that under the adopted parameterization the steady state of the model economy can numerically characterized by a debt output ratio of 0.3387. The numerical simulations show alternative steady states attainable by the government of the model economy. In order to finance higher expenses the government is bounded to trade-off higher interest rate (low inflation or high return on real money balances) with low operational surpluses due to the higher debt output ratio at the long run equilibrium."

Consequently, specific policies have to be put in place in order to create right incentives for banks to expand housing finance volumes, independently of a potential expansionist credit market.

A default may be avoided by an inflation tax on common-currency debt, but this decision depends on majority voting and have costs associated with it. Moreover, the model considers symmetry between national and central governments' decisions about inflation and also describes the loss in international bankers' confidence towards one country being passed on to another. One of our results is that, for a country with low weight in the voting system, common-currency regime is superior in terms of expected welfare to dollarization and may be a better choice than the local-currency one, as the central bank under the latter regime undergoes some political influence from its government."

The second set of results is that (1) there seems to be no evidence that Inflation Targeting countries experienced a significant increase in the level of their real interest rates after they adopted the new regime and that (2) even after controlling for the level of real interest rates there is still a causal effect from the adoption of Inflation Targeting to the reduction in inflation rates.

The main conclusions of the paper are the following: (1) Greater competition in the loan market enhances the response of the real economy to an interest rate shock; (2) Increased competition and/or a more efficient verification technology reduce the reaction of both the default rate and of the bank interest spread to an interest rate shock; and (3) The influence of the verification technology in the economy's dynamic response is greater when banks operate under perfect competition.

For daily VaR two simple methods seek to extract the volatility information conveyed by the high frequency data. The first method is based on the sample standard deviation with a moving window, while the second is based on exponencially wheighted moving average. Both methods tested presented good performance. For intraday VaR the results indicate that the filtering of the seasonal pattern is a fundamental step in obtaining useful forecasts of volatility and VaR."

However, the overall portfolio may not be efficient, as the portfolio managers do not take into account the overall covariance matrix. We show that the initial endowment that portfolio managers can use within the firm in order to manage their portfolios can be used as a control variable by the top administration and redistributed within the firm in order to achieve overall efficiency."

Traditionally, this wedge is the bank loan spread but we extend this concept to include the sovereign (country) credit risk and name it, Extended Credit Channel. Armed with this new concept and using a set up model, we estimate two econometric equations for the Brazilian economy after its inflation stabilization program. These two econometric equations measure: (1) the effects of the pure money channel (real interest rates and compulsory reserve requirements on demand deposits) and the extended credit channel (country credit risk and bank loan spread) on the economy's production, and (2) the impacts of the real interest rates, compulsory reserve requirements on demand deposits, and country credit risk on the bank loan spread. Both equations coefficients signs conform to the expected theoretical model. With the results of the estimated equation (1), we define a Product Loss Index Number to compare these two transmission channels (extended credit and pure monetary). This comparison shows that the extended credit channel is a relevant as the pure monetary channel."

A question that the paper aims to address is whether macro or microeconomic factors are the most relevant ones affecting the behavior of such rates. A two-step approach due to Ho and Saunders (1981) is employed to measure the relative relevance of the micro and the macro elements. The roles played by the inflation rate; risk premium, economic activity, required reserves (all macroeconomic factors) and CAMEL-type indicators (microeconomic factors) are highlighted.

A policy under commitment generates a better-weighted average of the variances of output and inflation (""dynamic gains""), and eliminates the inflationary bias. Commitment usually delivers a lower variance of inflation and a higher variance of output than those under discretion. The effect of the presence of inflation persistence on the dynamic gains from commitment is somehow surprising: the benefits are increasing in the degree of inflation persistence for moderate levels of persistence. On the other hand, inflation persistence reduces the inflationary bias. Furthermore, under ""restricted commitment"", were the solution is restricted to be within the same family of rules of the discretionary case, the gains are substantially inferior to those from commitment."

The paper finds that the pass-through coefficients increase the larger is the horizon measured, with its peak at 12-months. It also finds that RER misalignment is the most important determinant of inflation for emerging markets while the initial inflation is the most important variable for developed countries.

Next, we apply a difference-in-differences framework using firms not yet penalized for “unregistered employee” infractions as the control group to estimate the effect of labor inspections on firm-level outcomes. We find that formal employment and formal labor hiring experience a positive spike in the year of the inspection, indicating the formalization of unregistered employees. However, formal employment declines steadily over time, dropping nearly 60% by the fourth year after inspection. Among firms with active bank relationships, revenue falls sharply by about 24% over the same period. We also observe a persistent reduction in the outstanding loan amount and significant rise in the non-performing loan ratio. The average formal wage drops by about 1% in the year of inspection, but returns to pre-inspection levels in later years.

Based on the model of self-fulfilling debt crisis developed by Cole and Kehoe [4], it is possible to evaluate the comparative welfare of economies, which either keep their local currency and an independent monetary policy, join a monetary union or adopt dollarization. In the two former monetary regimes, governments can issue debt denominated, respectively, in local and common currencies, which is completely purchased by national consumers. Given this ability, governments may decide to impose an inflation tax on these assets and use the revenues so collected to avoid an external debt crises. While the country that issues its own currency takes this decision independently, a country belonging to a monetary union depends on the joint decision of all member countries about the common monetary policy. In this way, an external debt crises may be avoided under the local and common currency regimes, if, respectively, the national and the union central banks have the ability to do monetary policy, represented by the reduction in the real return on the bonds denominated in these currencies. This resource is not available under dollarization. In a dollarized economy, the loss of control over national monetary policy does not allow adjustments for exogenous shocks that asymmetrically affect the client and the anchor countries, but credibility is strengthened. On the other hand, given the ability to inflate the local currency, the central bank may be subject to the political influence of a government not so strongly concerned with fiscal discipline, which reduces the welfare of the economy. In a similar fashion, under a common currency regime, the union central bank may also be under the influence of a group of countries to inflate the common currency, even though they do not face external restrictions. Therefore, the local and common currencies could be viewed as a way to provide welfare enhancing bankruptcy, if it is not abused. With these peculiarities of monetary regimes in mind, we simulate the levels of economic welfare for each, employing recent data for the Brazilian economy."

The probability of occurrence of speculative attacks grows with the monetary suply, the real effective exchange rate, the international interest rate, and the liberalization of capital controls and diminishes with the international reserves, the real gross domestic product, the exchange rate fixed by the government, the square of the international interest rate, the external price level, and the international trade in goods.

It is shown that a variable seasonal pattern, which is a linear function of the nominal interest rate, increases the model ability to explain seasonal changes in the money demand. Despite the economic instability that marked Brazilian economic history during the last two decades, the model shows good fit and predictive power. Finally, it is shown that unsuccessful macroeconomic stabilization programs were marked by excessive liquidity, with money supply exceeding expected conditional money demand during intervention periods.

We argue that the new policy framework has been subject to a severe test in its first years of existence, represented by external shocks - oil prices, and increased international financial volatility. Moreover, we examine some selected issues that deserve due consideration given their importance to the conduct of monetary policy. The first issue is the presence of a substantial portion of prices with backward-looking adjustment, a fact that affects monetary policy reaction since it reduces the efficiency of domestic interest rates in controlling inflation. The second addresses the question of how inflation targets should be monitored in a country that has an ongoing economic program with the International Monetary Fund. This last issue is particularly important when considering the effects of shortening monitoring horizons on the variability of inflation and output."

We find the solution for the optimal portfolio allocation for a head trader operating in n different markets, which is called the optimal centralized portfolio. However, as there are many traders specialized in different markets, the solution to the problem of optimal decentralized allocation should be different from the centralized case. In this paper we derive conditions for the solutions to be equivalent. We use multivariate normal returns and a negative exponential function to solve the problem analytically. We generate the equivalence of solutions by assuming that different traders face different interest rates for borrowing and lending. This interest rate is dependent on the ratio of the degrees of risk aversion of the trader and the head trader, on the excess return, and on the correlation between asset returns."

In the first part, the CPMF is analyzed under the scope of the economic theory. In the second part, the international experience with taxes similar to the CPMF is discussed. At the end, the Brazilian experience is analyzed, considering the contributions of the two previous parts. According to the economic theory, the CPMF should increase real interest rates unproportionally to other taxes, as a result of the inclusion of asset turnover in its incidence base. This conceptual deficiency would negatively affect, unproportionally to its tax collection, the level of capital, production and wages. It would also cause the increase of government expenditures through interest payments, implying a fictious amount of revenues. The CPMF would cause disintermediation and illiquidity in the financial markets, hindering the resurgence of credit in Brazil. The tax collection would follow a Laffer curve, with high deadweight losses, particularly when compared to its small revenue. Empirical results confirm that those conclusions would be valid in the Brazilian case. The economic theory, the international experience and the Brazilian evidence reveal, therefore, that the CPMF presents significant inefficiencies as a tax collection instrument."

Wadhwani (1999) proposed a UIP, where real variables like the unemployment differential, the current account differential, and the excess return of financial assets affect the expected exchange rate. The objectives of this paper are first to include, as in Wadhwani (1999), some real variables to anchor exchange rate expectations. In our case, the long-run value of the exchange rate is determined by balanced external accounts. Second, we use this approach to simulate the behavior of key macroeconomic variables in an inflation-targeting structural model for Brazil. Finally, we compare the results with those of a random walk specification. The impulse responses under the UIP-with-fundamentals model seemed to be more realistic than those obtained by using other specifications for exchange rate forecasts."

The results show that interest rate affects output gap with a lag of one quarter and output is positively related to inflation with a one lag only. The devaluation of the nominal exchange rate has also a contemporaneous effect on inflation. We also made stochastic simulations in order to depict the inflation and output gap volatility loci under alternative Taylor-type rules and under an optimal rule, which minimizes a loss function that depends on a weighted average of inflation and output gap variances. The stochastic simulation showed that when compared to the variance in inflation, output gap variance appears to be more sensitive to the weights given in the loss function. It also showed that optimization procedures longer than 6 periods are inefficient and the most efficient frontier horizons are set within the range of 2 to 4 periods. Finally, sub-optimal but simple rules, like Taylor type rules can perform as well as the optimal ones, depending on the parameters chosen and on the preferences of the Central Bank."

This uncertainty fostered the emergence of several methods for calculating the potential output. In this work, the production function approach was chosen because it has important advantages compared to others, although it has limitations. The preliminary results found for the Brazilian economy are the following: a) total factor productivity (TFP) decreased in the last two decades, however, the negative trend was reverted after 1992 and, since then, TFP has been growing, on average, 0,9% per year; b) since 1980, most of the time the Brazilian economy has been below its potential. The years with strongest activity were 1980, 1985 and 1986; c) simulations involving different scenarios for investment and TFP growth rates, show that the average potential output growth for the 2001-05 period should be between 3,3% and 4,5%; d) although these figures are much lower than those registered before 1980, they are higher than the average GDP growth in the last two decades; e) because of the deep structural changes the Brazilian economy has been experiencing recently, we can expect TFP growth to increase in the next years. Even so, without increasing investment rates significantly, Brazil will not grow at rates near to its historical average."

Market projections made by private consulting institutions and banks turned out to be quite efficient for up to 2 quarters ahead, with almost no bias and low dispersion, suggesting the acceptance of the market efficiency hypothesis. The SSMM performed quite well for whole forecast horizon, presenting almost no forecast bias and low dispersion.

In this way, these estimators also reduce a central bank's need to time-series average the monthly inflation estimates which greatly improves the timeliness of the inflation statistic. In the case of Brazil, we find that asymmetrically trimming 24 percent from the tails of the price-change distribution reduces the RMSE of the monthly inflation statistic as a measure of the inflation trend by 23 percent, making it as accurate as the 3-month average growth rate of the mean retail price measure. We also demonstrate that a 3-month lagged moving average of the optimal (asymmetrically) trimmed mean is as efficient an estimator of the 24-month centered moving-average retail price growth trend as the mean inflation rate averaged over any horizon."

A dynamic factor model is then used to extract common cyclical movements in a set of variables that display predictive content for inflation. The leading indicators are designed to serve as practical tools to assist real-time monitoring of monetary policy on a month-to-month basis. Thus, the indicators are built and ranked according to their out-of-sample forecasting performance.

The main determinants of the extent of inflationary pass-through of the depreciations (appreciations) are the cyclical component of output, the extent of initial overvaluation of the real exchange rate (RER), the initial rate of inflation, and the degree of openness of the economy. The paper finds that the pass-through coefficients increase the larger is the horizon measured, with its peak at 12-months. It also finds that RER misalignment is the most important determinant of inflation for emerging markets while the initial inflation is the most important variable for developed countries. Using the estimated model, the paper predicts somewhat higher inflation than actually observed in several well-known large depreciation cases, even if one takes into account existing measures of exchange rate expectations. This suggests that policy makers should use caution when using past models to predict future inflation in the aftermath of large depreciations."

 """,2000.,Private Sector Participation: A Theoretical Justification of the Brazilian Position,"3, Central Bank of Brazil, Research Department.","The Brazilian position on the issue of private sector participation in the efforts to forestall and resolve emerging markets crises is that there should be an approach of contacting and convincing a large number, but not the totality, of private creditors. They should be convinced that the international public sector loans will allow a transition to stability that is overfinanced in case they voluntarily join in by maintaining their exposure to the country, at the spreads they choose, and with the counterparts they wish to have as clients. We model private sector participation by means of a game. We show that the traditional argument that there is a coordination problem among the private creditors does not exist is in a model without Knightian uncertainty, because there is only one Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium which involves participation. By introducing Knigthian uncertainty, we show that if the degree of uncertainty, as measured by the uncertainty aversion, is high enough, then there is only one Nash equilibrium under uncertainty, which involves nonparticipation. Finally, we show that if there is a large enough number of private creditors who decrease their uncertainty aversion, then again private participation becomes the unique Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium under Knightian uncertainty. If we interpret the approach and convincing of the private creditors as decreasing their uncertainty aversion, then this last result is a justification of the Brazilian position. In fact, the private creditors would voluntarily choose to maintain their exposures, because private sector participation is the unique Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium under uncertainty of the game."
