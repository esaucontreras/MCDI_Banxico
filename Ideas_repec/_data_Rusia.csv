 """,2025.,On equilibria in the model of deposit markets with exogenous switching costs of depositors,"wps151, Bank of Russia.","We model the deposit market, where commercial banks compete using deposit interest rates, and depositors initially distributed among banks, when switching to another bank, bear the exogenous switching costs associated with a lack of information and money transfer fee. We consider both discrete and continuous distribution of depositors over switching costs and find equilibria in pure strategies. The theoretical model in hand allows us to explain the empirically observed negative relation between the size of a bank and its weighted average deposit rate. We show that this dependence may be the result of the history of the banking market formation. Initially, established banks could manage to obtain a majority of depositors with high switching costs, while depositors with low costs could be lost to newly emerging banks. Because of this, previously established banks can set lower deposit rates without fear that their depositors will switch to competitors, and maintain a large share of all depositors in the market. It follows from the analysis that the division of large banks into smaller ones will not lead to an increase in their deposit interest rates, but on the contrary, may even increase discrimination against depositors with high transition costs. It is the reduction of depositorsâ€™ switching costs that makes banks to raise deposit rates and thus increase public welfare."

 """,2024.,Measurement of auxiliary indicators of aggregate interest rates on loans to non-financial organisations,"wps137, Bank of Russia.","Currently newly issued loans with fixed rates, excluding loans to affiliates, are used to calculate Russian loan aggregates of interest rates on loans to non-financial organisations, which is generally in line with international practice. The structure of loans is evolving over times, the share of loans with floating interest rates is increasing. Data on the volumes and rates of such loans can be valuable for analysing and forecasting economic trends. This paper looks at approaches to calculating weighted average interest rates on loans to Russian companies with the division of loans for analytical purposes into separate lending segments: by rate type (fixed and floating), affiliation type, and the time of rate-setting relative to the moment of disbursement of funds. We assess the amplitude of variation between the rates calculated using different approaches. The use of a wider range of aggregates can be used for analytical and research purposes to assess changes in certain types of interest rates, as well as to clarify the effect of the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism."

 """,2024.,Financial literacy and responsible financial behaviour of Russian households,"wps132, Bank of Russia.","Data of the All-Russian Survey of Consumer Finances for 2020 and 2022 are used to analyse the relationship between financial literacy and responsible financial behaviour indices. Responsible financial behaviour involves consumption smoothing, asset diversification, nonspeculative investments and a low/moderate debt burden, acquisition of information for decisionmaking, the appropriate perception of macroeconomic trends, the absence of naive decisions and confidence about the future. The role of financial literacy is controlled by including educational indicators, financial experience, personal preferences (risk tolerance, planning horizon / future discounting, overconfidence, optimism) and a large number of standard control variables. The results show a positive relationship between financial literacy and overall responsible financial behaviour. Our analysis of the aggregate indicatorâ€™s components lead us to conclude that improved financial literacy at the individual level can help smooth out consumption (through diversification of savings) and, at the macroeconomic level, help development the economy and financial market instruments. In general, financial literacy fails to guarantee confidence in state pension initiatives and does not ensure a less risky investment profile or a lower debt burden."

 """,2024.,Network structure of the economy and the propagation of monetary shocks,"wps130, Bank of Russia.","We calibrate a network model and monetary shocks based on empirical data from inputoutput tables for the Russian economy. We examine various aspects of the propagation of monetary shocks, such as the dispersion of relative prices and the local peak values of the aggregated price index achieved during the convergence to the new equilibrium. We show that these developments depend significantly on the way new money is injected into the economy."

 """,2024.,Russian Economic Transformation: Navigating Climate Policy and Trade Restrictions,"wps125, Bank of Russia.","We are considering the introduction of climate policy in Russia under conditions of quantitative export restrictions. We have enhanced the model employed in the article (Burova et al., 2023) by incorporating a mechanism for quantitative trade restrictions. We demonstrate that in the case of deterioration in external economic conditions, such as a decline in the prices of Russian exports, the significance of quantitative export restrictions becomes secondary. The reason is that at low export prices the optimal physical volume of exports only marginally exceeds or may even be less than the quantitative restrictions. Without unrestricted access to global green technologies, ambitious climate policy goals may become excessively costly in terms of economic impact. In the presented model, attempting to achieve a 70% reduction in CO2-equivalent emissions from the 2016 level, coupled with decreasing prices for Russian exports and quantitative trade restrictions, could result in a deviation of GDP in 2040 by 11% from the baseline scenario, which implies maintaining the current status quo in climate policy both in Russia and globally. A more economically viable approach seems to be a moderate climate policy: achieving a 36% reduction in emissions from combustion compared to the 2016 level results in a 4.7% downward deviation of real GDP in 2040 from the baseline scenario. Only 0.3% of this decrease is attributed to the impact of domestic climate policy through an emissions trading system. The remaining 4.4% is explained by the deterioration of external economic conditions, stemming from the climate policies of other countries and quantitative restrictions on Russian exports. In the absence of a proactive climate policy, the carbon intensity of Russian GDP rises, amplifying transitional and physical risks of addressing the consequences of climate change. Essential measures to mitigate these risks involve the promotion and development of green industries, particularly those oriented towards exports."

 """,2024.,Bank Market Power and Monetary Policy Transmission: Evidence from Loan-Level Data,"wps123, Bank of Russia.","This paper asks the following questions. How does market structure reshape the transmission of monetary policy to bank lending? How are loan characteristics such as loan volume, maturity, lending rate, risk, and the extensive margin of lending affected? Is there a trade-off between financial stability and the strength of monetary transmission? We find that, on more concentrated markets, the effect of monetary policy on lending rate and risk taking is amplified whereas the effect on loan volume is muted. Our current findings may imply the existence of a trade-off between the strength of monetary policy transmission and financial stability, but are subject to further investigation."

 """,2024.,Energy transition scenarios in Russia: effects in macroeconomic general equilibrium model with rational expectations,"wps122, Bank of Russia.","We use a DSGE model for a hydrocarbon-rich country to examine the macroeconomic implications of scenarios that lead to an energy transition. Our findings show that the scenario of the fall in export revenues from brown energy sales is the least preferred for energy transition in terms of welfare loss, while the scenario of imposing higher taxes is more acceptable. The most favourable scenario leading to the smallest drop in public wealth and long-term growth in output and consumption involves the productivity incentives in the green energy sector. We also analyse the impact of mechanisms such as monetary policy inertia, the level of openness of the financial account, technological substitutability between brown and green energy. We found that news about the future implementation of green policies alone cannot trigger the energy transition. Investments become cleaner after the news announcement, but this barely increases green energy production."

 """,2023.,"Default correlation impact on the loan portfolio credit risk measurement for the ""green"" finance as an example","wps121, Bank of Russia.","Default correlation parameter has a material impact on the loan portfolio credit risk. Moreover, the impact is more complex than that of the default probability itself. Current study shows that the rise in default correlation can simultaneously lead to multi-directional changes in different types of risk-measures or focus on a single risk measure, but at different confidence levels. The cause for such dual impact lies in the often neglected rising impact of the default rate (DR) distribution bimodality. In general, we evidence that rise in default correlation produces a multiplicative effect of the probability of default (PD): risk measure declines for low PDs and rises for high PDs, but changes are non-proportionate for the same changes in default correlation. Similar effects, in particular, may arise when augmenting the proportion of ""green"" lending. Moreover, when such a trend is associated with the decline in PD for the ""green"" sector and PD rise for the ""brown"" one, there is an overall reduction in the loan portfolio credit risk in the long-run. However, it is witnessed only after its rise in the mid-term. The paper is accompanied with the relevant codes. They enables the interested parties to replicate the findings, as well as to derive credit risk parameters for any given DR time series and model a DR distribution for any set of distribution mixture parameters."

 """,2023.,Probability of requesting unsecured loans:analysis of Russian household finances,"wps120, Bank of Russia.","Household spending usually accounts for about 70% of total spending in the economy. An important role in the financing of household spending play lending, and Russia is no exception. The aim of this research is to measure the elasticity of the loan request probability in relation to the interest rate with given inflation expectations. Our model is estimated using the unique data obtained from the All-Russian Survey of Consumer Finances, which contains information on more than 6000 households in Russia. We identify a set of Russian householdsâ€™ characteristics that are key drivers for householdsâ€™ requests for credit. The results show that growth in inflation expectations positively correlates with demand. It also takes a significant change in interest rates for the interest rate channel of monetary policy (with regard to unsecured loans) to make an impact. The model estimates we obtain are used in scenario forecasting to project the number of households requesting loans. According to a mid-point forecast by Rosstat, demand in terms of household count will be steady and boosted by the growth of the population of 18+ years of age. Even so, this growth is expected to be offset by a changing demographic structure. The results may be specific only to the period under study (2020â€“2022) and are not necessarily universal."

 """,2023.,Decomposition of Corporate Credit Growth Using Granular Data,"wps119, Bank of Russia.","Applying a new method of decomposition of corporate credit growth, we estimated what part of credit expansion in Russia in 2018–2021 was accounted for by companies that had experience in credit borrowing in the past, and what part was due to newcomers to the corporate bank loan market. In absolute terms, the share of the loan portfolio attributable to companies that are new to the credit market (the extensive component of growth) is small. A fact that is not obvious at first glance, which we confirm in the course of the study, is that their contribution to fluctuations in the growth rates of credit aggregates, on the contrary, is large. The fact is that companies with existing credit relationships (the intensive component of growth) borrow and repay comparable amounts. Moreover, both the same borrower and different borrowing companies can borrow and repay - we draw a conclusion about their net activity. What unites them and allows us to consider such borrowers on a net basis is the presence of bank loans in the past (based on this fact, we can talk about such a set of borrowers as an intensive component of the growth of corporate bank loans). Thus, the net contribution of the intensive component to credit expansion is small. During the acute phase of the pandemic (from June 2020 to May 2021), the role of lending on preferential terms increased noticeably and then decreased. For companies new to the lending market from affected industries (according to the list of the Russian Government), this growth was especially noticeable. This corresponds with other results: the massive inflow of borrowers at the beginning of the pandemic was sporadic and tightly linked to the state support measures. In this regard, the lower default rates of loans issued with the start of state support programs (between June and September 2020) probably do not imply better quality of borrowers, but reflect the features of the subsidised loans. Within the framework of already existing credit relations (the intensive component of growth), the contribution of preferential lending to the growth of corporate credit was relatively stable until July 2021, after which the contribution of the non-preferential component began to grow rapidly. An increase in the share of inactive borrowers, i.e., those who have open but unused credit lines starting from April 2021. Potentially, this type of borrowers may quickly increase their borrowings via open credit lines under adverse economic conditions. Thus, entail additional risks to banks. In this regard, we suggest the close monitoring of open and used credit lines. However, actual utilisation of credit lines could be bounded by terms of credit agreement, revaluation of collateral, and could led to smaller volumes of funds available during adverse economic conditions."

 """,2023.,Visible prices and their influence on inflation expectations of Russian households,"wps117, Bank of Russia.","A multitude of recent research shows that the inflation expectations of households are far from rational. In making inflation forecasts, people tend to focus on the prices of particular goods and services, which they can observe every day – ‘visible prices’. In this paper, we propose a new method for the identification of such items. Our novel ‘brute force’ algorithm automatically sorts through the full array of prices of goods and services given by Rosstat and constructs consumer baskets. It then selects the best baskets based on their ability to forecast the inflation expectations of Russian households from the FOM Survey. In the end, we get a decomposition of various met-rics of inflation expectations for visible prices which also demonstrates good forecasting perfor-mance (as compared to the AR(1) process as a benchmark). To ensure robustness, we use an alter-native method (optimisation with regularisation) and a variety of metrics of inflation expectations. As a result, we get lists of ‘robust visible items’ which include not only foodstuffs but mainly durable goods and services. Surprisingly enough, oil and petrol, which are typically labelled ‘vis-ible goods’ in research, do not fall into this category for Russia."

The proposed algorithm is based on the application of amortized neural networks and consists of two steps. The first step simulates artificial datasets from the model. In the second step, a neural network is trained to predict the future values of the variables using the history of observations. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is its speed. This is due to the fact that, after the training procedure, it can be used to yield predictions for almost any data without additional simulations or the re-estimation of the neural network."

Specifically, we investigate dynamic responses of lending, funding, and risk taking. The main finding is that, in normal times, the dynamic responses of dependent variables of interest are consistent with the prevalence of the international lending channel whereas in the low rate environment the patterns are different for different indicators: in some instances the dynamic effect of interest is attenuated compared with normal times, in others, it is reinforced."

 """,2023.,Inequality and monetary policy: THRANK model,"wps113, Bank of Russia.","The paper explores the mutual influence of inequality and monetary policy. The model introduces household heterogeneity in terms of access to the financial market and intertemporal preferences. The parameters are calibrated and estimated based on both Russia's microdata (including RLMS-HSE and HBS) and macro statistics. We have shown that the introduction of households with no access to the financial market has only a slight impact on the transmission of a monetary policy shock, while its secondary effects help amplify the action of most structural shocks. The behavior of wealthy hand-to-mouth households amplifies the response of macroeconomic variables to the monetary policy shock but has a slight impact on these variables' responses to most of the other structural shocks. We have identified non-structural inequality shocks at the bottom and the top of the Lorenz curve. As a result, we have found that the mutual influence of inequality and monetary policy is limited. The interest rate immediate response to changes in the Gini consumption index equals 0.1 for inequality shocks and 10 for a monetary policy shock. We have demonstrated that the shocks at the top of the Lorenz curve cause a more persistent response from the economy, whereas the shock at the bottom of the Lorenz curve. On first approximation, only one integral inequality indicator can be used to study the role of inequality in a business cycle. The relative consumption dynamics for specified household groups is not a conclusive indicator of either pro- or disinflationary policy, but it provides additional data to help identify structural shocks."

 """,2023.,Does CPI disaggregation improve inflation forecast accuracy?,"wps112, Bank of Russia.","If the consumer price index (CPI), one of the main indicators of inflation, consists of several components, would it be more accurate to forecast them separately? International experience shows that the aggregate of individual forecasts is often more accurate than the forecast of the aggregated index. In this paper, we explore this issue for Russia and test whether the quality of inflation forecasts can be improved by the CPI individual components forecasting. Using the panel data of Russian regions for the period from 2010 to 2021 we partially confirm the usefulness of a disaggregated approach. Individual modelling of the short-term price dynamics of individual commodity groups is ahead in terms of accuracy of the overall inflation model, including standard benchmark models, but only under certain conditions. First, it is necessary to include the factors of trend inflation in the models, which helps to separate the trend inflation acceleration/deceleration from short-term idiosyncratic fluctuations. Secondly, the models should have the property of inflation convergence to its long-term level, determined by the Bank of Russia's goal. Under these conditions, the disaggregated approach gives a more accurate forecast on short horizons than the aggregated one and a forecast of comparable to non-structural models’ accuracy on longer ones. Additionally, good predictive properties of the “anchored” forecast model were established (the “anchored” forecast is equal to the target inflation rate). The accuracy of this forecast turns out to be higher than the accuracy of standard models and does not deteriorate with an increase in the forecast horizon. This allows us to recommend this model as a simple non-structural benchmark for measuring the quality of inflation forecast models in Russia."

Narrowing down the long list of all news items to only the strongly negative requires taking into account the concept of rational inattentiveness by the implementation of a 'too costly to ignore' principle. The feature importance models return very close results about the high importance of three main factors: news about the acceleration of inflation and single prices, about economic crisis and recession, and about the devaluation of the ruble, which is closely related to geopolitics. We also report differences in 1) higher and lower income households' perception of inflation and 2) in the formation of expected and perceived inflation. With these findings, we shed more light on the nature of households’ perception of inflation, which might be useful for central bank communications, especially during crises."

 """,2023.,Transmission to a low-carbon economy and its implications for financial stability in Russia,"wps109, Bank of Russia.",Energy transition and climate policies associated with it may become one of the major challenges for the Russian economy. We present an approach to assessing consequences of climate policy for Russia and evaluating related transition risks for the country’s financial system. This approach relies on a CGE model for the Russian economy and a financial model based on firm-level data. We show that both international and domestic climate policies affect the financial stability of the Russian Federation. The effects of international climate actions summarised in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario are bigger than the effects of the introduction of a domestic emission trading system with a reduction goal of the Intensive scenario of the Russian state strategy of low-carbon development.

 """,2023.,A Feasible Approach to Projecting Household Demand For The Digital Ruble in Russia,"wps108, Bank of Russia.","We estimated a model of householdsâ€™ usage of alternative payment instruments (cash and bank cards) using a new dataset from a survey of Russian households. In our modelling set-up, householdsâ€™ preferences are determined by the instrumentsâ€™ perceived attributes and hence their choice regarding payment methods depends on the differences across instruments in these attributes. The results indicate a statistically significant sensitivity of consumer choice to the perceived attributes. We employ the estimated model to evaluate the demand for CBDC depending on its expected design and consumersâ€™ perception of it. We discuss several illustrative projections to demonstrate the application of the tool developed. The predicted utilisation of CBDC varies considerably depending on the attributes hypothesised, although under the conservative assumptions, the projected use of CBDC in household transactions is limited."

 """,2022.,Corporate credit in Russia during COVID-19 pandemic: the role of credit lines,"wps110, Bank of Russia.","We study corporate loan composition in Russia during the pandemic along two dimensions. First, we analyse the quality composition of borrowers of new loans. Like most existing studies, we measure the quality of borrowers at the levels observed before, not during (or after), the pandemic. Using probability of default to measure borrower quality, we find that the share of loans provided by banks to firms with weaker fundamentals, as identified even before the pandemic, increased during the pandemic. This increase is economically significant. The result does not depend on the â€™riskinessâ€™ of banks (as measured by the share of nonperforming loans on their balanceÂ­sheets). We argue that the subsidised loan programmes (with government guarantees) may help to explain this unpleasant result. Second, we analyse the share of loans provided during pandemic through credit line utilisation as compared with new standÂ­alone loans. We find that credit line utilisation increased during the pandemic irrespective of firmsâ€™ ex ante probabilities of default. Thus, credit lines played the role of an automatic stabiliser during the period of high demand for liquidity. At the same time, credit line utilisation decreased during the pandemic among firms in the exposed industries. We also find that financially weaker banks tended to have higher shares of credit line utilisation before and during the pandemic, and this may have implications for the banksâ€™ stability"

 """,2022.,Effects of the fiscal rule and model assumptions on the response of inflation in the aftermath of a terms-of-trade shock,"wps107, Bank of Russia.","Does a stabilization fiscal rule based on long-term resource prices and the formation of a sovereign wealth fund effectively reduce volatility of output, inflation, and exchange rate? Given that the previous fiscal rule in Russia has been violated since the beginning of 2022, what might the new fiscal rule look like and will it be effective? We tried to answer these questions using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. A study shows that there are a number of economic parameters and types of fiscal rules under which the introduction of a mechanism for smoothing budget expenditures does not lead to a decrease in the volatility of some macroeconomic indicators. We have found that cases, when the introduction of a smoothing mechanism does not lead to a decrease in the volatility of output and the exchange rate, are rare and economically interpretable. As for the effect of the fiscal rule on inflation volatility, it turns out that it depends on many parameters such as such the design of the budget rule, the duration of price and wage contracts, and the presence of capital control. The fiscal rule, which operated until 2022 and used an external sovereign wealth fund, proved to be the most effective for stabilization purposes. In the new reality, with the impossibility of accumulating external reserves, the rule that saves additional oil and gas revenues within the country and uses the debt market to smooth budget revenues turned out to be the most effective and feasible."

The author compares these figures with similar data for other economies. Additionally, we indirectly take into account the quality aspect of this dependence, that is, a small number of possibly critical components for industries that might exist. We assess both the direct dependence of industries and their indirect dependence resulting from consumption of other domestic sectors' products also containing imported components. The findings of the research suggest that the dependence of the sectors of the Russian economy on imported inputs is relatively low, even though the share of imports for certain industries can be high in absolute terms. In most of the sectors, dependence on imports is the same as or does not exceed the average for a similar group of economies."

Illustrations using the examples of stochastic volatility model, nonlinear dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and seasonal adjustment procedure with breaks in seasonality show that the algorithm has sufficient accuracy for practical use. Moreover, after pretraining, which takes several hours, finding the posterior distribution for any dataset takes from hundredths to tenths of a second."

Our debt service analysis also takes into account the companyâ€™s ability to meet its current liabilities with cash and funds borrowed under credit lines. Our sectoral analysis of Russian companies highlights sectors of particular concern. The machinery and electronic components sector has a large share of non-profitable companies with a small amount of cash, on the one hand, and profitable companiesâ€™ DSRs are higher on average than in other sectors, on the other hand. Oil and gas companies and firms in metals, mining and chemicals and agriculture largely have a big difference between the share of rouble debt service and the share of revenue originating from Russia and CIS countries, which indicates exposure to currency risks (although companies hedge their foreign currency risks with cross-currency and interest rate swaps). Credit lines may be a source of funds to meet current liabilities, but actually, they only allow postponing payments building up debt service for future periods. Using simulation of a 25% revenue shock, we demonstrate a significant increase in the debt service ratio, especially in such sectors as machinery, construction and real estate, and energy. The use of credit lines concurrently with the emergence of this shock brings financial stability risks for the broader economy."

 """,2022.,Distressed Firms and Loan Guarantee Programs During the COVID-19 Crisis,"wps102, Bank of Russia.","To mitigate the shocks caused by the pandemic-related restrictions, many governments have implemented extensive enterprise support measures, including the provision of government guaranteed loans to businesses that faced a sharp decline in revenues. In Russia, the introduction of loan guarantee programs has allowed many businesses which never obtained bank loans previously to apply for them under new circumstances. This led to a sharp increase in the number of small loans. At the same time, our estimates show that financially vulnerable companies are less likely to receive loans under loan guarantee programs. Our estimates for the Russian economy show that participation in loan guarantee programs has helped firms in industries hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis better retain sales and employment levels. On the other hand, our results suggest that if loans are obtained by zombie firms or financially vulnerable companies, a positive effect is either absent or weaker than for financially stable enterprises."

We control for the specifics of industries and sectors. The availability of E-risk data for half of the sample implies the need to apply the Heckman selection model. We show cases when the climate-credit risk relationship is robustly positive for a particular industry and region: in such cases, loan subsidies are indeed advisable to finance large green projects and green corporations (e.g. the 2021 Bank of Japan program Ð though it was tailored for SMEs). Otherwise Ð in the predominant number of cases Ð such a loan rate reduction may foster the accumulation of credit risks and pose a threat to financial stability. We contribute to the literature by showing that the revealed positive climate-credit risks dependence is not ubiquitous Ð which is argued by (Capasso, Gianfrate, & Spinelli, 2020)."

 """,2022.,Labour market and inflation relationship indicator,"wps96, Bank of Russia.","The labour market is closely connected to inflation processes, and is therefore a key factor to consider in monetary policy decisions. Russian regions differ substantially in terms of employment, wages, migration flows and the age structure of their population. Therefore, the effects of regional changes in the labour market on prices may be different. Since the Central bankâ€™s inflation targeting policy is pursued nationwide, it is important for a regulator to factor in regional heterogeneity when assessing the impact of changes in the labour market on inflation growth. This paper brings forward a composite indicator of the contribution of labour market changes to inflation increase â€“ the Labour Market Indicator (LMI). To capture regional heterogeneity in terms of market labour indicators, regions are grouped into four clusters with different social, demographic and economic characteristics. We make the case that the impact of unemployment on inflation can be described as slight or moderate in Russia. The calculated quarterly LMI values are overall consistent with the actual effect of the labour market on inflation processes over the entire time horizon under study, which suggests that the estimates are reliable. The important benefit of the LMI is that it is possible to interpret and allows to assess the future impact of labour market on inflation one quarter ahead of available statistical data â€“ which helps make better informed monetary policy decisions."

We distinguish two types of monetary policy: (1) that causes by changes in the current rates and (2) that causes by any other reason (such as forward guidance, communication, and central bank information). We find that these two types have distinct effects on financial variables. The first type better explains the variation of interest rates for the entire yield curve. In contrast, the second type explains the variation in the exchange rate and market indices. Moreover, we also show that monetary policy transmission from interest rates to inflation takes about one year but this effect is only temporary."

 """,2022.,Foreign Currency Debt and Exchange Rate Pass-Through,"wps93, Bank of Russia.","This paper studies both theoretically and empirically the firmâ€™s choice of currency for its debt. We use a parsimonious model with financial frictions to derive an intuitive sufficient statistic for the share of foreign-currency debt in firmâ€™s liabilities and demonstrate its robustness in several extensions. Due to the risk management considerations, firms are more likely to borrow in dollars when the pass-through of the exchange rate into their profits is higher. We leverage this insight empirically using the micro-level data on loans issued by Russian banks to local firms as well as the data on firmsâ€™ balance sheets and cash flows. The data strongly supports the predictions of the model indicating that firms with profits more stable in dollars are more likely to borrow in foreign currency than firms with profits stable in local currency. These results extend to a choice between the euro and the dollar and survive after controlling for firmsâ€™ size and export status. Note that our results describe efficiency at the firm level, and they do not have direct implications for macroprudential policy as foreign currency debt may also affect exchange rate volatility, inflation and output."

 """,2022.,"Model Risk for Acceptable, but Imperfect, Discrimination and Calibration in Basel PD and LGD Models","wps92, Bank of Russia.","The Basel Internal-Ratings-Based (IRB) approach allows banks to use sufficiently good credit risk models for the daily computation of their capital adequacy ratio. However, being sufficiently good does not naturally mean being perfect. Conventionally, risk managers increase the mean probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) values by some margin when developing a model. They expect that it is sufficient to offset for potential model risk. This add-on, thought to be conservative enough, gave rise to the term Ôconservative marginÕ. The novelty of this paper is that we are the first to identify the cases when such a margin is not sufficient. The principal cause is the previously ignored requirement to ÒfreezeÓ capital against the existing loans. This capital tie-up does not allow reallocating excessive capital requirements from actual non-defaults (false negatives) to unforeseen defaults (false positives). This is the first time when such a novel cause of model risk is discussed. The value the paper creates is severalfold. First, the revealed model risk has a material scale and can be part of the bankÕs explicit or implicit risk-taking strategy. Therefore, it should be considered by researchers, as well as by validators and supervisors. Second, the paper offers an indicator to expand the risk indicator dashboard suggested by the Basel Committee, when designing risk-reward remuneration. This is especially true of contracts with risk model developers."

Following an extended period of regulatory forbearance on bank misreporting, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) adopted in 2013 a regime of tight bank supervision and intolerance to weak, non-transparent and fraudulent banks, which resulted in license revocation of the two-thirds of operating banks over the period between 2013-2020. We analyze unique loan-level data from the Russian credit register and show that, following bad bank closures, bad firms go to another (still operating) bad banks and good firms go to good banks. The matching of bad firms and bad banks is fueled through common ownership structure and weakens when concentration at local credit markets rise. We show that neither bad nor good firms possessed information on the CBR’s actions (no anticipation of bad bank closures). We reveal that the policy had cleansing effect on the structure of the economy: after bad banks closure and before finding new banks, good firms improve their performance (default rates drop, employment and income rise), whereas bad firms further deteriorate. Finally, we find that the policy was pro-active: still operating bad banks turned to reducing their corporate and retail lending, creating more loan loss reserves and disclosing more non-performing loans."

The positive effect of debt finance on the likelihood of staying in the market comes from the group of large enterprises which are not involved in innovation activities.

It also takes into account the structure of a small open economy, external (relative to the region) monetary conditions and other factors that drive changes of the Ural economy. The model is estimated by Bayesian methods based on international OECD, EAI, FRED and FAO statistical data, federal and regional statistical data by Rosstat and the Bank of Russia for 2009 Q1â€“2020 Q4. While describing DEMURâ€™s properties, we demonstrate the modelâ€™s capabilities by decomposing historical and forecast data. The model enables the analysis of changes in economic indicators on both Russian and macroregional levels in response to domestic or external macroeconomic shocks, and quantifies the macroregionâ€™s contribution to changes in countrywide indicators, making it a valuable tool for macroeconomic analysis."

The modeled economy is open and highly dependent on the terms of trade (TOT). Economic dynamics is the result of a TOT shock and an external interest rate shock. Using impulse response functions, we show that the presence of the ZLB reduces the impact of positive external shocks. This means greater growth in real interest rates and lesser growth in consumption and production. The monetary authority minimizes the volatility of key macroeconomic indicators. The optimal parameters for the rule turn out to be such that the regulator de facto reduces the probability of being at the ZLB. At the ZLB, the regulator is less responsive to inflation changes, and the interest rate is more persistent. In the case of Russia, we have got low probability estimate of hitting the ZLB under the current monetary policy and a long-term value of the interest rate of 6%. The gap reaction parameter and interest rate persistence parameter for the current monetary policy are in the range of values for optimal monetary policy rules. The current CPI reaction parameter is much less than the optimal one. This implies a higher probability of hitting the ZLB in the optimum than under the current monetary policy. We also found that under current monetary policy, the likelihood of reaching the effective lower bound (ELB), defined by the alternative households' ability to save, is quite significant"

Our model combines nominal rigidities and capital accumulation, features that have usually been studied separately in previous literature. In our model, we show that agents do not internalise how their asset purchases affect asset prices. Thus, when crises occur, there are fire sales: less demand for capital further reduces prices and agents are worse off. Policy interventions (both monetary and macroprudential) can improve allocations by restricting borrowing ex-ante (during the accumulation of risks and imbalances) and stimulating the economy ex-post (during crises). As a result, we find a complementary relationship between ex-ante monetary policy and preventive macroprudential policy.

However, this logic does not hold if a bank employs different money market instruments for the lending and borrowing activities. In this environment, it may be appropriate to adjust the loan rates when a bank transitions between liquidity surplus and deficit (i.e. switches between the benchmark money market rates). This strategy is fundamentally different from linking the loan rates to the average cost of funding (i.e. the average between retail and wholesale funding rates).

World-wide there are above two thousand banks running the Basel internal models. However, there are countries that have none of such banks. For them there exists a dilemma. Namely, which transition path to adopt out of the two. The voluntarily one as in the EU or the mandatory one as in the US. Our objective is to take the investor perspective and benchmark those two modes. Thus, we wish to find whether there is a premium for any of them, or perhaps that they are equivalent. The novelty of our research is the robust estimate that investors prefer mandatory transition style to the voluntarily one. Such a preference is reflected in the rise of the mean return and decline in stock volatility for the transited banks in the US and right the opposite consequences in the EU. However, we should be cautious in interpreting our findings. Such a preference may not only be the premium for the breakage of the vicious cycle and the ultimate improvement in the banks’ risk-management systems and the overall financial stability. It may also hold true if and only if the mandatory transition for particular institutions is accompanied by a restriction for other banks in the region to transit.

In the series of experiments, we quantify how each of these issues affect the out-of-sample error. We illustrate, that the neglect of the release timing generally lowers the errors. The same is true for the use of seasonally adjusted data. The impact of the data vintages depends on the model and forecasting period. The overall effect of all three inaccuracies varies from 8% to 17% depending on the forecasting horizon. This means, that the actual forecasting error can be significantly underestimated, when inaccurate pseudo real-time experiment is run.

We identify statistically significant relationships between the shortlisted financial ratios and the subsequent default events. To estimate the odds of the borrower to default on its obligations, we simulate its probability of default at a horizon of one year. We horse run the constructed PD model against the alternative measures of ex ante credit risk that the related literature on bank risk-taking widely uses: credit quality groups and credit spreads in interest rates. We compare the results obtained with the PD model, and with the alternative approaches. We find that the PD model predicts the default event more accurately at a horizon of one year. We conclude that the developed measure of ex ante credit risk is feasible for estimating the risk-taking behaviour by banks and analysing the shifts in portfolio composition with the sufficient degree of granularity. The model could be used in applied research as the tool for measuring ex ante credit risk based on micro level data (credit registry)."

The latter is explained by the fact that the CPI naturally considers price changes for both tradable and non-tradable goods.

Rolling regression in different periods shows that the ERPT becomes more stable and more precisely estimated after 2014-2015 when the Bank of Russia switched to inflation targeting.

We run the same regression on forecasted data and obtain estimates of the ""shock-independent"" ERPT from the structural model. We compute shock-dependent ERPT from model impulse responses. The magnitude of the ERPT varies for different shocks with the highest value attributed to domestic monetary policy shocks. When estimating the pass-through of the exchange rate to prices, care must be taken of which shock caused changes in the exchange rate. Since monetary policy shocks appear to be associated with the highest ERPT, and the ERPT becomes more stable after 2014-2015, the Russian economy may be reaping an additional benefit of inflation targeting in the form of reduced monetary policy shocks and a more stable ERPT."

Results based on public procurement data provide evidence that additional financing from government contracts helps both the most and the least efficient firms to survive and shelters them from competitive pressure. In the short run, the positive effect of winning government procurement contracts for leaders seems to be only observed in their home regions, providing indirect evidence that the public procurement system does not support all types of firms with growth potential but only those affiliated with local authorities. Intervention in the mechanism of market selection through the system of public procurement could have a strong negative effect on economic growth as it provides incentives for inefficient firms without growth potential to stay in the market longer."

The results suggest a decrease of welfare of the representative consumer and real GDP with the deterioration of the terms of trade. In the Central scenario (a 10% decrease in the world price of crude oil, a 3% decrease in the world price of natural gas and an 8% decrease in the world price of petroleum products) welfare of the representative consumer decreases by -1,17% of benchmark consumption level or -0,58% of the base year GDP in the comparative static model. Percentage change of the GDP in the Central scenario of the comparative static model is of the same magnitude as decrease in representative consumer’s welfare in terms of the benchmark GDP: -1,55%. Welfare changes associated with the Central scenario of the steady-state model, where capital stock adjusts to its long-term level, indicate a significant decrease in the welfare of the representative consumer up to -2,64% of benchmark consumption level or -1,23% of the base year GDP. Percentage change of the GDP in the Central scenario of the steady-state model exceeds representative consumer’s decrease in welfare in terms of the benchmark GDP: -2,51%. The model was validated by historical simulation with observed levels of exogenous parameters, mimicking change in economic environment from 2011 to 2015. The results of the historical simulation stress the importance of fiscal parameters (i.e. export taxes) in analysis of production behaviour of Russian extraction industries."

Using the microdata of Russian firms on sales over the period from 1999 to 2017, we test the hypothesis that the Russian economy is granular. Here we found that idiosyncratic shocks contribute significantly to total sales volatility. It was also revealed that the effect of linkages is more important in aggregate volatility estimation, but not for the top-100 largest firms.

On the basis of 35 series from the accounting reports of Russian banks, we form two data sets of 69 and 721 variables and use them to build random forest and gradient boosting models along with neural networks and a stacking model for different forecasting horizons (1, 2, 3, 6, 9 months).

Stacking and random forest generally have the best forecasting performance comparing to the other models. We evaluate models with commonly used performance metrics (ROC-AUC and F1) and show that, depending on the task, F1-score could be better at defining the model’s performance. Comparison of the results depending on the metrics applied and types of cross-validation used illustrate the importance of choosing the appropriate metric for performance evaluation and the cross-validation procedure, which accounts for the characteristics of the data set and the task under consideration.

We report several empirical observations that illustrate the potential procyclicality (relative to credit developments) of inflation targeting policy where commodity price fluctuations are the main drivers of macroeconomic developments. Namely, we find that relative prices in commodity-exporting economies are much more volatile than in other countries. The length of periods when relative prices grow or decline is comparable to the monetary policy horizon of most inflation targeters (2-3 years). Note that the central banks that target inflation, including those of the commodity-exporting countries, usually target the headline CPI. This index accommodates relative price changes by design. We proceed with formal statistical testing using panel structural VARs and local projection models. The tests support the procyclicality of inflation targeting, but only in a group of emerging market economies, which in practice have more procyclical fiscal policy than advanced economies: monetary policy eases in response to a higher price of an exported commodity while real credit grows. Counterfactual exercises show that endogenous monetary policy responses to commodity shocks explain around 20% on average of the real credit growth in a group of commodity exporting countries for which the reaction of policy rates to commodity shocks is statistically significant. We cross-check the empirical findings by reviewing a collection of papers with estimated DSGE models and analysing impulse responses of real policy rates to commodity price changes. We also conduct a theoretical analysis and compare stabilization properties (while accounting for financial stability risks) of the inflation-targeting policy rule and the ‘leaning against the wind’ policy rules. Notably, we do this exercise conditionally on the role of commodity price shocks for the economy. For this purpose, we use the DSGE with financial frictions and a banking sector estimated basing for the Russian economy and measure the efficiency of policy results with different sensitivity to credit developments (the ‘leaning against the wind’ rules) under different variance of oil price shocks (which may be interpreted also as different efficiency of fiscal policy in insulating the economy from a given oil price volatility). Results show that when commodity price volatility is relatively high (fiscal policy is not countercyclical), leaning against the wind outperforms pure inflation targeting, thus supporting our empirical findings. Interestingly, even when the financial stability risks associated with the volatility of credit developments are negligible, a moderate leaning against the wind policy is still preferable. As policy implication, we point that a commodity-exporting economy should have countercyclical fiscal policy for inflation targeting to become countercyclical in a commodity cycle."

We develop an innovative multi-region model of trade and FDI for preferential trade analysis where we incorporate Dixit-Stiglitz endogenous productivity effects from trade and FDI liberalization. This model produces important differences compared with a perfect competition model. We build on numerous surveys and econometric estimates of the trade and FDI barriers in our focus countries that we helped develop. We show that if the EAEU effectively implements its objectives for trade cost reduction, it would lead to significant welfare gains of between 0.8 to 4.8 percent of consumption, depending on the country. If these deep integration measures are extended to third countries, either by a wider liberalization effort or by spillovers, then the estimated welfare gains increase between 2.5 and 4.5 times for Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. Using the neoclassical model of labor migration, we estimate that the right to legally work in the Russian Federation is approximately of equal value to Armenia as the combined aspects of the reduction of trade costs, including FDI liberalization. Our estimates show that all the spillovers are beneficial to all the EAEU countries. Among the various reforms under consideration, we identify which reform is most important for each EAEU member country; and we identify whether the European Union, China or the United States is the most important external region for each member country if the reforms are extended to third countries."

It does not matter whether the central bank sterilizes the bank reserves that it supplied to the money market and prevents the interest rate change – money will be created anyway (although sterilization may prevent further money creation through credit extension). Our empirical analysis shows that for emerging markets the type (2) adjustment is more common than type (1). Therefore, the accumulation of foreign reserves is likely to create money even when sterilized (i.e. it does not lead to lower money market interest rates)."

We seek to demonstrate that even though foreign exchange reserve purchasing by a central bank has no direct effect on the dynamics of money supply or credit as long as an efficient bank liquidity management mechanism is in place, its indirect effects may be substantial. They are reflected in changes in the balance of payments (an increase in current account surplus and (or) an inflow of capital into the non-banking sector) and an increase in risk taking in the banking sector. That said, money supply does not expand if foreign exchange reserve accumulation is accompanied by the comparable increase of sovereign wealth funds, e.g. as part of a formal fiscal rule. On the other hand, sovereign wealth fund spending stimulates money supply growth only if it is not accompanied by a commensurate decrease in foreign exchange reserves. The Bank of Russia has been actively accumulating foreign exchange reserves over the past few decades. Analyses of the implications of those steps are often limited to reviewing the effect of changes in the supply of bank reserves in the interbank market. Indeed, this effect may be important in terms of managing liquidity or short-term interest rates. Yet in this note we examine the implications of foreign exchange reserve accumulation by a central bank in a broader sense, and analyse the changes it causes in the banking system balance sheet and the balance of payments."

The negative direct impact on GDP growth from the medium-term fiscal consolidation is estimated as relatively small (cumulatively about 0.3 percentage points through 2018-2020). Fiscal consolidation scheduled for the medium-term is expected to have a negative impact on output. However, since it is intended to be carried out mainly at the expense of the expenditure part of the budget, this should be less harmful to output growth and could promote greater efficiency in public spending. The direct impact from a reduction in expenditures can be fully offset by a significant positive indirect impact on GDP from an increase in confidence about long-term fiscal sustainability."

Fiscal multipliers in the Russian economy proved to be rather low, in part due to “leakages” through imports and relatively low efficiency of budgetary funds. We estimate the multipli-er of total revenue of Russia’s budget at -0.75 and the multiplier of total spending at +0.28. Therefore, changes in the budget revenue produce a stronger effect on GDP growth com-pared with the effect from the comparable change in expenditures. However, compared to changes in expenditures, changes in revenue feed through to GDP growth more slowly. Our analysis of the components of total expenditure based on the Russian and inter-national experience suggests that in terms of the functional classification of expenditure, the biggest is the fiscal multiplier for economic spending, followed by military and social blocks. Spending on general state issues have a negative multiplier. The analysis of the economic classification of expenditure showed that the investment component has the highest multiplier. It exceeds more than twofold multipliers for other components. The estimation of the effects of the fiscal manoeuvre using fiscal multipliers gives grounds for expecting in the medium term additional 0.2-0.3 pp to GDP growth per year on average as a result of the manoeuvre. However, the actual effect may prove materially higher than the estimated one in case of efficient fund utilisation (e.g., a thorough selec-tion of investment projects) as well as rapid cost cutting coupled with labour productivity growth by VAT payers. This will raise the fiscal multiplier for spending and lower it for rev-enue. Additionally, fiscal multipliers demonstrate a short-term effect of the fiscal policy on GDP growth without assessing its impact on the potential growth, which should also be positive. The current situation in the economy bordering on the full utilisation of resources may serve as a constraining factor, thereby lowering the efficiency of their utilisation."

Differences in credit penetration levels can be partly attributed to the loan demand factors. For example, low credit penetration in the Central Federal District stems from the relatively high level of accumulated net assets (especially as regards liquid assets), which reduces the demand for loans. In Eastern Russia, in districts with comparable income levels and less net assets, high credit penetration rates are primarily attributable to income growth expectations. In these regions, accumulated net assets are generally viewed as a supplement to loans. Analysis of the loan demand model in Southern Russia points out a relatively high level of risk, with loan demand growing despite deterioration of the financial situation (including financial expectations). Low credit penetration in the underperforming districts has largely to do with credit supply constraints as banks factor in higher risks associated with strong gross regional product volatility and job market uncertainties. This means that aggressive loan expansion driven by the growing number of new borrowers in the federal districts with small and volatile incomes and a lower credit penetration rate may threaten the social and financial stability in such regions."

Our research shows that, in the medium term, such a policy reduces monopolism and raises efficiency of the banking system. Yet, it has an adverse effect on small and medium-sized banks over the short term. All in all, the long-term benefits of proactive supervisory policy might significantly outweigh the short-term negative effects from a temporary increase in banking business concentration. In order to examine the effects of proactive banking sector resolution, we have constructed an agent-based model of the banking sector and calibrated its key variables using Russian banking sector data. On the basis of the model, we compare the short- and long-term effects of two supervisory policies with different degrees of tightness. The results of model simulation show that in the short-term a proactive supervisory policy adversely affects small and medium-sized banks, including those complying with supervisory requirements. Yet, as the banking sector rehabilitates, the benefits from increasing trust in such banks and the banking system in general outweigh the short-term losses. Eventually, the share of small and medium-sized banks in loan and deposit markets turns out to be greater compared to the period prior to the supervisory policy being made stricter. Monopolism in the banking sector decreases and price competition improves. The banking system efficiently creates credit and gets rid of the excessive risk to individual and systemic sustainability, while preserving the average credit risk of projects.

Our findings are as follows: After the launch of the banking sector resolution, a significant break in competition, as measured by the rate spread, was observed only in household deposits maturing in one to three years and household and corporate loans maturing in more than three years. This kind of structural break, however, is associated with macroeconomic factors rather than the Bank of Russia’s banking sector resolution. Other banking markets failed to see any significant change in competition after the launch of the banking sector resolution. After the launch of the Bank of Russia’s banking sector resolution, growth in corporate and retail lending showed a decline in volatility. This decline was observed both in a cluster of banks characterised by relatively low overdue debt, and in banks characterised by relatively high levels. Thereby, the reduction in the number of banks resulting from the Bank of Russia’s banking sector resolution had no considerable negative effect of competition in the period under review. At the same time, lower volatility in lending growth boosted banking system stability. We estimate that banking sector stability has grown by 4% in retail lending and 41% in corporate lending"

 """,2017.,Estimating the exchange rate pass through effect on prices at the micro level,"note12, Bank of Russia.","This analytical note investigates the exchange rate pass-through mechanism at the micro level, i.e. at the level of individual enterprises. Theoretical models of the optimal behavior of companies and analysis of their actual activities demonstrate that when the national currency weakens (or strengthens), large companies with a relatively low proportion of import costs can raise (cut) prices more intensively than that proportion dictates. This variation is achieved through active margin management, i.e. increasing or decreasing of the margin in response to anticipated pricing activity of competitors. The pass-through effect, therefore, is not determined solely by the amount companies spend on imported materials and components or by the market share of importers. In order to estimate the intensity of the effect it is also important to know the number of companies in the market, as well as its structure, and, accordingly, the extent to which companies take into account their competitors actions. Using Russian data we have compared the estimates of the pass-through effect calculated on the basis of expenses with the estimates that take into account the ability of a company to manage their margin and the extent to which they consider competitors actions. The study shows that, first, the estimated pass-through effect calculated on the basis of expenses at the micro level was 0.18, which lies within the range of published macroeconomic estimates. Surveys indicate that the pass-through effect is asymmetrical: when the ruble weakens, the effect is twice as strong as when the ruble strengthens. Secondly, the pass-through effect estimates change only slightly when companies motivation to manage their margin actively is taken into account. In part, this reflects the insignificant intra-industry variation of the proportion of imports in costs, which reduces a companys motivation to correct the pass-through effect; moreover, to a certain degree, it reflects the different directions of pass-through effects at the industry level, which offset each other in the total price index. Our estimates show that in agriculture and food production the pass-through effect is strongly affected by companies behaviour: they closely track the pricing policy of their competitors. These industries are generally represented by several very large enterprises, which have a relatively high proportion of imports in costs, and a large number of small companies with smaller import ratios (regional producers). When the exchange rate is weakening, major market players have to decrease their margin in order to maintain their market share, whereas small companies can aggressively raise prices to improve their financial standing (at the cost of their larger competitors). Our estimates demonstrate that, as far as food production is concerned, the total market influence of small producers is prominent enough for the pass-through effect to be greater than the effect of transfer based on costs. As a result, prices turn out to be more volatile within given ruble exchange rate range (growing more intensively when the ruble weakens and falling when it strengthens) than they would be in a more homogeneous industry. Therefore, the strengthening of the ruble in 2016-2017 had an additional minor disinflationary effect in agriculture and food production due to the competition structure in these industries. This can help explain variation in the dynamics of food and core inflation in 2017 as well as the contribution of the pass-through effect to the food and core inflation in September, estimated at the macro level. Exchange rate shifts not only create price effects in the above industries, but also lead to the redistribution of profits between producers. When the ruble is falling (such as in 2014-2015), this redistribution negatively impacts the financial standing of larger borrowers (who usually have a large proportion of imports in costs) in the short term. This can lead to increased risks for financial stability. At the same time, small companies obtain additional resources for development and investments. As a result, in the midterm, the financial stability of these industries improves."

 """,2017.,The effects of Financial Shock on Russian short-term equilibrium interest rates,"note11, Bank of Russia.","We estimate the impact of the Russia-specific shocks of 2014 on the short-term real equilibrium interest rate. We have used two approaches. The first approach is based on theoretical model calculations. The second rests on empirical estimates based on the results of IMF cross-country research on the sensitivity of the equilibrium interest rate to shifts in investment demand and supply (savings) curves. Our estimates suggest that the 2014 financial shock that restricted external borrowing for Russian issuers triggered 0.6-1.4 pp growth of the short-term equilibrium interest rate. However, the economy adjusted to the financial shock in 2016-2017 thanks to the macroeconomic policy pursued: the CDS risk premium declined, investment resumed growth and the net investment position gradually decreased. As a result, the effect of the financial shock on the short-term equilibrium interest rate has almost entirely vanished Length: 13 pages"

 """,2017.,Consumer lending in Russia: prospects and risks based on household finance survey,"note10, Bank of Russia.","As our calculations show, borrowers with incomes above the median level, who did not apply for loans earlier, could represent 2/3 of extensive growth in the volume of consumer lending. But in the new environment it is difficult to rely on individuals who did not apply for loans even during the boom period of 2010-2012, in the context of rising oil prices and growing incomes. Banks’ choice of this area will necessitate additional costs that will make credit more expensive and thus less attractive to this group. As regards intensive credit growth, the debt burden of borrowers with incomes below the median level has growth potential. Due to the interestrate sensitivity of this group’s demand for credit, the Bank of Russia’s transition to a neutral key rate may provide some support to credit growth, provided that banks are willing to choose business models with lower profit margins. Macroprudential policy measures can incentivise banks to adapt less risky business models, helping them lower interest rates and thus making loans more attractive to creditworthy borrowers. The identified structural features of loan supply and demand make it possible to draw a number of conclusions for the regulator’s policy: 1. The transmission of monetary policy to consumer lending may prove weaker than commonly assumed. First, the reduction of the key rate by the Bank of Russia may modestly translate to a decline in banks’ interest rates due to the fact that high interest rates reflect the particularity of banks’ business models, which target high-risk borrowers. In order to enhance the trans mission, banks will have to adapt to a different model. Second, the level of loan interest rates per se has only a limited impact on demand for loans of this kind, the structures of which are governed to a significant extent by demand from low-income borrowers who are largely insensitive to interest rate levels. 2. The growth of lending in a context of magnified inflation expectations facilitates the accumulation of vulnerabilities in the consumer lending segment, posing risks to financial stability and requiring macroprudential policy adjustment. Magnified inflation expectations can prompt borrowers who evaluate real interest rates as extremely low to take further risks and accumulate excess debt. When these borrowers possess predominantly low and unstable incomes that are sensitive to macroeconomic shocks, banks find themselves exposed to increased credit risks, which, in certain circumstances, can have systemic consequences. In these situations, macroprudential policy measures are capable of protecting both banks and borrowers from taking excess risks, directing banks towards less risky groups of borrowers and thus increasing their resilience in the new environment."

Widespread methods of assessing the observed inflation inertia using different models can’t clear up important aspects, such as between-industry analysis based on firm-specific characteristics and, consequently, the speed of response to external shocks in different sectors. The paper investigates the pricing behaviour of firms on the basis of a survey of companies’ conducted by the Bank of Russia. According to the results the main drivers of inflation (price) inertia (or delayed and prolonged response of inflation to shocks) in Russia are backwardlooking (or adaptive) expectations of economic agents, inflexible pricing policy, and wage indexation based on past inflation level. It is important for central banks to understand these processes in order to implement and maintain the effective monetary policy."

 """,2016.,The equilibrium interest rate: a measurement for Russia,"wps13, Bank of Russia.","The aim of this paper is to measure the equilibrium interest rate for Russia both in the short and long run, based on three definitions of the equilibrium interest rate. A general equilibrium model for the Russian economy is being built and gauged. In this real business cycle of a commodity-centred economy with investment, we find that short-run estimates come with very extended confidence intervals (approx. +/-10 pp). In the long run, equilibrium interest rates in the model are set by one of its equilibrium conditions, which in practice will often be applied discretely to find the equilibrium interest rate. This condition-based estimate comes very sensitive to unknown parameters, and is also very uncertain. Additionally, we use the general equilibrium model to study how the equilibrium interest rate reacts to changing oil prices, a rising global rate and growth in consumers’ propensity to save. These calculations complement with panel data-based calculations (those for the long-run equilibrium) and computation built on semi-structural methods (for the current equilibrium). Such estimates are also characterised by a high, for practical purposes, degree of uncertainty for the long-run equilibrium, with its point estimates equalling to 1.0% è 3.0%. The point estimate of the current equilibrium short interest rate based on semi-structural methods comes at the level of around 0.5%, and the one derived from the interest rate parity is 2.7%. The uncertainty in the measures of equilibrium interest rates calls for a central bank to apply robust monetary policy rules."

We argue that one should not rule out the possibility that fluctuations in the loans-to-deposits and non-core liabilities ratios are driven by the banks. We also argue that, under a flexible exchange rate regime in which the central bank is not trying to accumulate foreign reserves, external transactions are unlikely to contribute significantly to money growth. To make our argument, we analyze a historical episode of these flows in Korea and Russia and conduct a canonical correlation analysis for a cross-section of emerging market economies."

The related inflation risks are currently moderate given that the money stock components with the fastest growth rates are not closely related to the aggregate demand. Nevertheless, inflation risks may increase in future if demand for liquid components of money supply grows and the composition of M2Y monetary aggregate returns to its 2011-2013 average values. We estimate that in this case the annual growth of household expenditures on final consumption may go up by 1.5 pp within two years, which may have negative inflation spillovers in 2017-2018."

When exchange rates are stable convergence to-wards higher equilibrium level of dollarization begins when the 45-50% threshold of deposit dollarization is exceeded. We estimate the model for short-run dynamics of dollarization and find that the speed of convergence towards higher equilibrium implies quarterly increase of the foreign currency deposits to total deposits ratio by 1.2-3 percentage points."

We apply three types of tests to these measuring instruments: tests for economic content and the ability to forecast future inflation, as well as a set of technical tests. We find that inflation indicators cal-culated on the basis of dynamic factor models emerge as the best performing candidates. The dynamics of the ob-tained range of underlying inflation measures in 2014 compared with headline inflation indicates that the accelerated growth in consumer prices was not fully reflected in underlying inflation dynamics."

We identify large and unex-plained supply shocks in loan fluctuations during the crisis of 2008-2009, signifying an impairment of credit markets. We also find contractionary shocks unrelated to demand fundamentals or balance sheet structures in 2013, although in general loan developments in 2013 and the first half of 2014 were not at all extraordinary."

The latter issues could, however, be practically resolved by means of dynamic factor model-ing, which has recently been recognized as a useful tool to evaluate current economic conditions by means of higher frequency indicators. Our main results show that the performance of dynamic factor models in predicting Russian GDP dynamics appears to be superior to other common alternative specifications.
