 """,2025.,Quantifying Uncertainty in France’s Debt Trajectory: A VAR Based Analysis,"1019, Banque de France.","We propose a simple, simulation based framework for stochastic debt sustainability analysis. Estimating a parsimonious vector autoregression (frequentist and Bayesian) on quarterly French data (1990:Q1–2023:Q4) for the debt's key drivers, we generate predictive fan charts and probability statements for debt to GDP outcomes. Median VAR projections are close to a hypothetical deterministic baseline derived from the deterministic debt sustainability analysis framework. Assuming this illustrative central scenario, historical relationships estimated by our VAR models imply a corresponding confidence band around the debt trajectory. The BVAR yields slightly wider cones and lower tail probabilities than the frequentist VAR, with cone widths between those reported by the European Commission and the ECB. Our analysis, which does not reflect the most recent developments in public finance, suggests that an ambitious fiscal consolidation effort would be required to materially enhance the prospects of stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term."

 """,2025.,Revisiting 15 Years of Unusual Transatlantic Monetary Policies,"1018, Banque de France.","The European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve introduced new policy instruments and made changes to their operational frameworks to address the global financial crisis (2008) and the Covid-19 pandemic (2020). We study the macroeconomic effects of these monetary policy evolutions on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean by developing and estimating a tractable two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. We show that the euro area and the United States faced shocks of different natures, explaining some asynchronous monetary policy measures between 2008 and 2023. However, counterfactual exercises highlight that all conventional and unconventional policies implemented since 2008 have appropriately (i) supported economic growth and (ii) maintained inflation on track in both areas. The exception is the delayed reaction to the inflationary surge during 2021-2022. Furthermore, exchange rate shocks played a significant role in shaping the overall monetary conditions of the two economies."

 """,2025.,When does Monetary Policy Matter? Policy Stance vs. Term Premium News,"1017, Banque de France.","This paper investigates when monetary policy announcements matter for asset price dynamics. We identify a fundamental heterogeneity in FOMC statements based on the underlying nature of information conveyed about future policy. Using a simple but novel classification, we identify meetings that convey substantial information about uncertainty surrounding future policy. These statements – one-third of the total – drive most, if not all, of the effects of monetary policy on long-term interest rates and account for a large fraction of their variation on these days. In contrast, directional statements about the policy stance – half of all meetings – have no effect on long-term rates but do affect short-term rates and stock prices. The strong effects on long-term rates stem from term premium adjustments rather than expected future short-term rates, consistent with investors’ updating their assessment of higher-order moments of future policy developments. Our classification resolves why policy announcements explain little variance in long-term rates despite driving their dynamics over time."

 """,2025.,"The Impact of ""Green Regulation"" on Firms’ Innovation","1016, Banque de France.","This paper analyses the effect of “green regulations” i.e. those aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change and environmental externalities, on innovation, using a novel regulatory database covering the period 2008 – 2022 for Spain. The database identifies regulations at both the national and regional levels through textual analysis. Employing a panel data approach, we assess how different types of environmental regulations—particularly those related to renewable energy—affect firm-level innovation activities. Our findings indicate that national level green regulations have a positive effect on innovation, whereas regional level regulations show mixed or negligible impacts. Importantly, the interaction between national and regional regulations, measuring the simultaneous production of legal texts at both levels can foster innovation but at a reduced pace with respect to the sole production of regulation at the national level. Given the results for regional-level regulation, our results provide evidence in favour of the hypothesis that regulatory fragmentation due to unequal, overlapping, inconsistent or conflicting procedure across jurisdictions may diminish these benefits."

 """,2025.,Does Merging Small Bankruptcy Courts Increase Their Efficiency?,"1015, Banque de France.","We estimate the impact of a 2009 reform that merged small bankruptcy courts on the quality of their rulings. A conceptual framework enables us to link difference-in-difference estimates to the impact of the reform on Type 1 errors (restructuring a non-viable firm) and Type 2 errors (liquidating a viable firm). We apply this framework to an (almost) exhaustive sample of 600,000 bankruptcy cases in France that started between 2000 and 2019. The reform unambiguously reduces Type 1 errors while having no impact on Type 2 errors. Post-merger court behavior is determined more by that of the absorbing court than by that of the absorbed one."

 """,2025.,The Shadow Rate Model: Let’s Make it Real!,"1014, Banque de France.","This paper expands upon conventional shadow rate models, which typically concentrate on the term structure of nominal yields, by integrating real interest rates. Close to zero-lower bound periods, real rates inherit part of the non-linearity stemming from the constraints that apply to nominal rates. We introduce a specific macro-finance adaptation of our real/nominal shadow rate model and apply it to U.S. data spanning the last five decades. We exploit the model to calculate real and nominal term premiums and to examine how the dynamic responses of real and nominal rates to economic shocks are constrained during zero-lower bound periods."

 """,2025.,Monetary Stabilization of a Multi-Sector Economy: Adding Words to Action?,"1013, Banque de France.","In a multi-sector economy, conventional monetary policy alone is insufficient for achieving optimal economic stabilization. We examine whether a central bank can leverage private information about economic conditions to enhance policy effectiveness and improve outcomes. Our normative analysis emphasizes that the central bank should refrain from manipulating private beliefs and, if disclosure is optimal, should communicate information truthfully. However, such a communication policy is generally not credible, as even a benevolent policymaker faces sequential incentives to influence the beliefs of price-setting firms to reduce price dispersion and its negative welfare effects. In the absence of commitment, reputation becomes crucial in shaping these incentives. Specifically, a policymaker who strategically discloses information may secure significant stabilization gains during her term, but at the cost of long-term economic inefficiency."

Despite that, the German Federal Finance Agency decided to cease all future issuance of these bonds in November 2023. We examine the market response to this announcement and find that neither the safety premia nor the trading conditions of these bonds have been negatively impacted. Hence, this bond market remains a rich source of information on real rates in the euro area in addition to offering investors a safe inflation-protected asset."

 """,2025.,Leverage and the Low-Carbon Transition in Europe,"1011, Banque de France.","Using data on verified carbon emissions from the EU emissions trading system, this paper examines the relationship between leverage and transition performance for highly polluting and mostly non-listed ETS firms over 2013-2019 that are responsible for approximately 20% of total EU emissions. Panel regression analysis indicates that, up to a certain point, firms with higher leverage have lower emissions and improved emission efficiency in subsequent years. But beyond that point, greater leverage is associated with worse transition performance. Exploiting a 2015 policy shock aiming at toughening the emissions regime in a difference-in-differences setup, we also identify a group of firms that appear too indebted to transition towards low-carbon technology."

 """,2025.,Pricing of Green Bonds: Greenium Dynamics and the Role of Retail Investors,"1010, Banque de France.","The green bond market has experienced rapid growth in recent years, driven by increasing global awareness of climate change. However, the existence, magnitude and driving forces behind the “greenium” in the secondary market - a price premium associated with green bonds - remain subject to debate. This study investigates the evolution of the greenium in the euro area from 2016 to 2023, encompassing a period of significant macroeconomic shifts, including the COVID-19 pandemic, energy crisis, and the subsequent period of heightened inflation and monetary tightening. Our analysis applies a k-prototypes matching algorithm to construct a closely matched panel of European green and conventional bonds and documents a novel finding that retail investors' demand for green bonds partly drives the greenium. Sensitivity of retail investors' financial conditions to the macroeconomic situation and particularly tighter monetary policy may explain investors' appetite for green bonds and thus the greenium time dynamics. Finally, we confirm investors' preferences for green bonds with higher credibility of both bonds and bond issuers."

 """,2025.,Evaluating the Financial Instability Hypothesis: a Positive and Normative Analysis of Leveraged Risk-Taking and Extrapolative Expectations,"1009, Banque de France.","Historical accounts of financial crises emphasize the joint contribution of extrapolative beliefs and leveraged risk-taking to financial instability. This paper proposes a simple macro-finance framework to evaluate these views. We find a novel interplay between non-rational extrapolation and investment risk-taking that amplifies financial instability relative to a rational expectation benchmark. Furthermore, the analysis provides guidance on the design of cyclical policy interventions. Specifically, relative to a rational expectations benchmark, extrapolative expectations command tighter financial regulation, irrespective of whether the regulator shares these expectations."

 """,2025.,Europe in the Headlines: What Two Decades of French News Reveal about EU Sentiment,"1008, Banque de France.","Using a large language model, we build a unique 400,000 corpus of articles related to the European Union (EU) published between 2005 and 2023 in more than 100 French local and national newspapers. Drawing on this dataset, we show that the interest of French newspapers in European issues has remained stable since 2005 and is primarily driven by the European elections every 5 years. An analysis of polarity and topics covered reveals that the local press pays greater attention to tangible EU initiatives—such as cultural exchange programs—which are generally portrayed in a positive light. Finally, we show that French media sentiment towards the European Union deteriorated significantly following the financial and sovereign debt crises, mirroring the trend observed in Eurobarometer opinion surveys on EU sentiment. However, from 2013 onward, a divergence emerged since sentiment in the press gradually returns to pre-crisis levels while public image of the European Union in the opinion remains below these levels. Focusing on the Euro area, we do not observe such a divergence."

 """,2025.,Measuring Households' Inflation Expectations in the Euro Area: The Effect of Panel Conditioning,"1007, Banque de France.","This paper documents how inflation expectations as reported by households in the European Central Bank's Consumer Expectations Survey vary with the tenure of survey respondents. Inflation expectations are significantly lower after some months of repeated participation in the survey, by about 2 percentage points after one year. Panel conditioning effects are much stronger if households are initially less attentive to inflation. We also document that these negative effects could be partly due to survey fatigue increasing with tenure. Finally, we find that the panel conditioning effects are not specific to inflation: they are also strong for other macroeconomic variables such as unemployment but they are not significant for households' perceptions of their own consumption or income growth."

 """,2025.,Seeds of Inflation: Macro Modelling of Nature-Related Risks through Agricultural Prices,"1006, Banque de France.","Ce document analyse l'importance macroéconomique des risques liés à la nature, tant physiques que de transition, à travers l'exemple du secteur agricole. Nos résultats montrent que des chocs temporaires subis par les principales cultures agricoles du fait de la dégradation de services écosystémiques pourraient faire augmenter l'inflation alimentaire de plus de 2 points de pourcentage et l'inflation globale de 0,5 point, la majeure partie de l’effet se matérialisant sur un horizon d’un à deux ans. Si ces chocs temporaires se répétaient et s’intensifiaient, ils pourraient générer des pressions plus persistantes sur l’inflation. De plus, en France, des restrictions désordonnées et non-anticipées sur l’usage des intrants agricoles pourraient réduire le PIB d’environ 0,2 % et augmenter les prix relatifs agricoles jusqu'à 12 % à moyen-long terme. Ces résultats montrent que, si la dégradation de la nature peut accentuer les pressions inflationnistes, une transition bien planifiée et coordonnée permettrait de mieux en atténuer les effets qu’une action désordonnée ou l’inaction. L’étude met également en évidence les limites importantes des modèles – telles que la représentation des non-linéarités, des boucles de rétroaction et des interdépendances sectorielles – tout en contribuant à une meilleure intégration des enjeux liés à la nature dans les cadres macro-financiers des banques centrales et des régulateurs."

 """,2025.,Geopolitical Risk and Inflation: The Role of Energy Markets,"1005, Banque de France.","Geopolitical shocks are not all alike -- different classes of geopolitical shocks can have different macroeconomic implications, particularly on inflation. This paper exploits the comovement between the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR) developed by Caldara and Iacoviello (2022) and oil prices across major geopolitical events to disentangle two types of geopolitical shocks within a structural VAR model for the US economy. The VAR estimates suggest that geopolitical shocks associated with disruptions in energy markets are on average inflationary and contractionary. In contrast, geopolitical shocks associated with macroeconomic developments that are unrelated to energy markets are on average deflationary and contractionary. To validate this interpretation, the paper exploits the heterogeneity across sectoral output and prices of the US economy to show that a sector’s response to a geopolitical shock depends on its energy intensity. Sectors characterized by higher energy intensity are subject to larger output losses and price increases in response to geopolitical energy shocks."

 """,2025.,Assessing Asymmetric Macroeconomic Risk,"1004, Banque de France.","I propose a dynamic factor model with time-varying skewness to assess asymmetric risk around the economic outlook across a set of macroeconomic aggregates. Applied to U.S. data, the model shows that macroeconomic skewness is procyclical, displays significant independent variations from GDP growth skewness, and does not require conditioning on financial variables to manifest. Compared to univariate benchmarks, the model improves the detection of downside risk to growth and delivers more accurate predictive distributions, especially during downturns. These findings underscore the value of using a richer information set to quantify the balance of macroeconomic risks."

 """,2025.,Currency Crises and Malnutrition,"1003, Banque de France.","This paper investigates the effects on children and adult height of currency crises experienced during childhood. It uses survey data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) collected in 57 countries between 1986 and 2023 for hundreds of thousands of children and adults, combined with a monthly dataset indicating the start of currency crises between 1970 and 2017. It finds that children facing a currency crisis between their birth and the date of the survey tend to be shorter, by about - 0.1 standard deviation (SD). Reduced food affordability explains part of the results: estimated effects are larger in net food importing developing countries and smaller when controlling for inflation. Children growing up during a currency crisis are less likely to eat any solid food and to have a diversified diet on the day preceding the survey, mostly because of a reduced consumption of nutrient-rich non-starchy food. Early exposure to currency crises have persistent effects on adult height. Adults having faced a currency crisis between their birth and 10 years old are on average shorter than their peers, with a maximum effect of about -0.04 SD for crises experienced between 5-6 years old. They are also less likely to have completed secondary or higher education. Our results are unlikely to be influenced by differential selection in parenting across households’ wealth levels, and are robust to a large number of alternative specifications and sample restrictions."

 """,2025.,Critical Minerals: Estimating Price Elasticity of Supply Using Mine-Level Data,"1002, Banque de France.","As the demand for critical minerals to the energy transition strongly grows, it is crucial to understand whether their supply is able to match it. In this paper, we address this question by estimating the price elasticity of supply for 8 minerals between 2000 and 2019, using mine-level production data with global coverage. We isolate global price variations related to mineral-specific demand shocks using a structural VAR with sign restrictions and study the reaction of mineral production to these price variations in a local projection framework. We find robust evidence of a significantly positive price elasticity of supply, reaching 50% on average in the five years following the shock, largely driven by silver, copper, and nickel. We explore how the location of mines, mine-level characteristics and market-level characteristics shape these elasticities. Among location factors, we find smaller elasticities for mines located close to conflicts. Such effects partly explain a smaller price elasticity of supply in Africa. Turning to mine-level characteristics factors, we find smaller effects for mines with larger proven reserves, a larger number of produced minerals and more than one owner. Finally, regarding market-level characteristics, we find smaller effects when the global production is more concentrated across mines. The magnitude and significance of estimated heterogeneity are stronger immediately after the shock and decrease over time, suggesting that producers adapt to their environment."

We exploit a feature of the ECB communication for identification: the revelation of dissent during press conferences is separated from policy decision announcements. Following a narrative approach, we compute a novel granular index of ECB dissent for each instrument and identify the dissent direction. Using tick data, we isolate asset price changes exactly when dissent is revealed. Dissent has a strong negative effect on stock prices, that operates specifically around status quo decisions. Dissent is a key driver of stock prices on these days, explaining one-third of their variation."

 """,2025.,Bridging the Gap in Macroeconomic Analysis of the Energy Transition: Combining Medium-and Long-Term Approaches,"1000, Banque de France.","The climate transition has long been considered as a long-term challenge, and the tools used to analyse it have been long-term models. At short- to medium-term horizons, forecasting models generally focus on demand effects of such a shock through the purchasing power of households. In this paper, we bridge the gap between these two approaches in order to study the effect of the Fit-for-55 package of the European Commission on the French economy by 2030, using an energy-augmented two-sector real model, FR-GREEN, as a source of shocks for the nominal forecasting model FR-BDF. We show that the benefit of reducing emissions implies some macro costs during the transition. In the short run, inflation increases substantially because of the direct effect of taxes levied on households. In the medium run, most of the total impact on output and inflation is due to large real supply effects from FR-GREEN. These supply effects come from a loss of apparent productivity implied by the transition from brown to green technologies, in the absence of any favourable assumption regarding technological progress potentially driven by the transition."

 """,2025.,The Signaling Effects of Tightening and Easing Monetary Policy,"999, Banque de France.","This paper establishes the asymmetric transmission of monetary policy to nominal yields of the four largest euro area countries. We document that the effect of easing monetary surprises is stronger than the effect of monetary tightening. The asymmetry holds beyond the nonlinearities related to the economic or financial environment and does not stem from information effects. We provide evidence that this asymmetry is driven by signals about the future policy path. Decomposing euro area interest rates between common and country-specific components, we show that the common component, likely capturing expectations of future short-term rates, generates the differentiated effects, while risk premium signals amplify the asymmetry. Using textual analysis to extract policymakers’ signals about the future monetary policy space from press conferences, we find that central bank communication can affect this asymmetric transmission to yields. Our results suggest a key role for the signaling channel in determining long-term interest rates."

 """,2025.,Green Finance and Deforestation Reduction in Brazil: a PVAR Analysis of the Amazon Fund,"998, Banque de France.","The Amazon rainforest is emitting more carbon dioxide than it can absorb due to deforestation since 2021, leading to significant impacts on global warming. The loss of biodiversity due to land use change in the Amazon biome is also a major issue. Legal Amazon is an administrative area in Brazil that encompasses 64% of the Amazon biome and nine federal states. The Amazon Fund is the main international climate finance vehicle that operates in Legal Amazon. However, its disbursements have recently dropped due to disagreements between donors and the Brazilian government up to 2022. This paper aims to assess the impact of the Amazon Fund’s projects in reducing deforestation along with other factors, such as the national environmental agency sanctions and agricultural production. Using satellite observations and microeconomic data, a panel dataset has been constructed to analyze the evolution of various environmental features, climate finance, regulation, and production from 2002 to 2020 across 760 municipalities in Legal Amazon. A Panel Vector Auto Regression (PVAR) is used to model a stylized economic system in which variables can affect each other at different lags. Our main findings suggest that the Amazon Fund’s disbursements significantly reduce deforestation rates. Federal-managed projects are more effective than those led by states or municipalities. The most efficient projects are those devoted to land use planning, which involves the development and the protection of local autochthonous communities. Overall, we estimate that the Amazon Fund operates with a low abatement cost (between 0.4 and 1.1 EUR per saved ton of CO2)."

 """,2025.,Imperfect Banking Competition and the Propagation of Uncertainty Shocks,"997, Banque de France.","Uncertainty shocks, by propagating through the banking sector, play a crucial role in driving business cycle fluctuations. To examine how the recent decline in U.S. banking competition has affected the transmission of these shocks, I develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model featuring heterogeneous banks, imperfect banking competition and financial frictions. The model shows that reduced competition in the banking sector leads to higher borrowing rates and increased risk-taking by borrowers. As a result, uncertainty shocks generate more pronounced increases in defaults and sharper contractions in investment and output in less competitive banking environments. Quantitatively, the model implies that the recent decline in U.S. banking competition results in a 0.1 percentage points larger drop in GDP one year after an uncertainty shock. This finding is supported by panel local projection evidence indicating that lower banking competition amplifies the negative impact of uncertainty on GDP."

 """,2025.,On the Distributional Effects of Conventional Monetary Policy and Forward Guidance,"996, Banque de France.","This paper investigates the distributional effects of conventional monetary policy and forward guidance. Using a structural VAR model, we estimate their impact on macroeconomic aggregates and consumption inequality in the United States. While aggregate real and financial variables respond similarly to both policy tools, their effects on consumption inequality diverge significantly. Conventional monetary policy shocks lead to countercyclical inequality, whereas forward guidance announcements result in a procyclical response, driven by heterogeneous reactions across the household spending distribution. We rationalize these contrasting outcomes both empirically and through a tractable New Keynesian model featuring household heterogeneity and government redistribution. In the model, a fiscal adjustment that differs in timing and magnitude induces a sharper decline in consumption among financially constrained households following conventional rate hikes but a more muted effect under forward guidance. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for the distributional consequences of different monetary policy tools and emphasize the critical role of fiscal policy in shaping inequality dynamics."

 """,2025.,Firms’ Inflation and Wage Expectations during the Inflation Surge,"995, Banque de France.","Using a new survey of French firms’ inflation expectations that predates the inflation spike, we document i) evidence on the anchoring of inflation expectations during the inflation surge, and ii) the relevance of inflation expectations for firms’ decisions. First, we show that inflation expectations under-responded to the initial surge but then persistently overshot actual inflation dynamics. As inflation rose, firms initially perceived inflation to be less persistent than in previous years, an effect that dissipated over time. Second, we find that inflation expectations correlate with firms’ wage and price decisions. One-year expectations matter more than long-term expectations. During the inflation surge, wage and price decisions became increasingly disconnected from inflation expectations. This suggests that the scope for wage-price spirals is likely more limited than one might have expected from the surge in inflation and inflation expectations."

 """,2025.,Explaining the Dynamics of the Gender Gap in Lifetime Earnings,"994, Banque de France.","Using a long administrative panel dataset for France, we analyse the dynamics and drivers of the narrowing gender gap in lifetime earnings (LTE) for cohorts born after WWII. We find that the level, trends, and distribution of gender differences in LTE contrast sharply with those observed in the US, and that these differences are more marked than when we compare cross-sectional gender gaps. We show that this reflects a specific pattern in which both men and women experienced earnings gains over the whole distribution (with the exception of the very top), in contrast with the US, where the same cohorts of men experienced earnings losses in the three bottom quartiles of the distribution. We then decompose the changing role of various factors (e.g., working (part) time, education, occupation, geographical location) in shaping the evolution of the gender LTE gap in France. The contribution of unobserved factors decreases across cohorts and increases along the distribution, remaining larger at the top, consistent with a glass ceiling effect. Meanwhile, the impact of observed factors rises, mostly due to the decline in the years worked full time by women, which has slowed gender convergence. Differences in educational attainment contribute to a lesser extent, as the gender gap in returns to education has narrowed."

Based on the securities of large European financial institutions (including the UK) spanning from 2005 to 2022, we show that, unlike physical risk, transition risk significantly and increasingly influences systemic risk in the financial sector. We also examine the potential levers available to financial institutions and regulators to address climate-related financial risk."

This downward trend is common to European countries and reflects the growing globalization process of recent decades. The location of a production plant in France has consequences throughout the value chain. These spillovers increase the positive effects of setting up a new plant on economic activity and employment in France, compared to the creation of a similar plant abroad. The spillover effect, defined as the total value added of the new plant and its suppliers compared to the value added of the new plant alone, and simulated here under the strong assumption that the supply chain of the new plant is similar to those of existing firms, would be around 2.0 in manufacturing industry and 1.6 in market services. If greenhouse gas emissions from production increase in France, they decrease worldwide, since production in France is less carbon-intensive than in the countries that supply imports."

Using recent advancements in difference-in-differences estimation to account for the staggered implementation of restructurings, we find that sovereign debt restructuring increases firm performance by 5–9 percentage points, with stronger effects for private, domestically-owned firms and those reliant on public and financial services. The impact varies by debt type (domestic or external), creditor composition, and implementation speed. Swift external restructurings led by official creditors, such as the Paris Club, yield the most substantial positive effects, whereas other types of restructurings show no significant impact on private sector growth."

 """,2025.,France's Green Horizon: Supply-Side Drivers for a Competitive Transition in Export Markets,"990, Banque de France.","France's green transition offers a unique lens into the interplay between decarbonisation strategies and industrial competitiveness within the context of a high-income economy. As a major European economy, France stands at a critical moment in balancing its reliance on nuclear power with the acceleration of renewable energy adoption and fostering green industrial innovation. This is relevant as the country faces increasing pressure to align with the EU's 2050 carbon-neutrality goals while addressing domestic challenges, including fiscal constraints. This study employs a descriptive methodology based on a comparative analysis of indicators. By analysing indicators such as R&D spending, patenting trends, renewable energy costs, and green export shares, the paper assesses France's green goods export competitiveness, industrial strengths, energy transition inputs, and transition risks relative to other G7 nations, China, and Spain. The findings reveal that while France benefits from strong nuclear infrastructure and high Green Complexity Potential, its share in global green exports has declined Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âfrom 4.7% in 2000 to 2.5% in 2022. Furthermore, lagging renewable energy deployment, limited fiscal support, and gaps in green innovation suggest that France risks falling behind some European counterparts, such as Germany or Italy, in achieving leadership in the green transition. However, opportunities exist in high-complexity sectors such as hydrogen, environmental monitoring, and carbon capture technologies, where France's existing capabilities can drive competitiveness and export growth. Its participation in a single European green good export market is a key strategy to strengthen a competitive transition in France and Europe more widely."

I show the impact of these price shocks to key financial and operational metrics, including value added, employment, real wages, labor share, profit margins, dividend payments, productivity, and credit risk. I highlight the asymmetric effects of oil price increases and decreases. A one standard deviation increase in the weighted oil price shocks leads to a Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬396 decrease in per capita productivity (in 2024 euros), and a 0.30 percentage point increase in the probability of default, while there is no significant effect in the case of oil price decreases, leading to persistent effects of oil price increases in the medium term. I also show heterogeneous effects of oil price increases across firm size and energy intensity. This paper has implications for policymakers, especially those concerned with financial stability (bank stress-testing, climate stress-testing, macro-financial modeling), and competitiveness, and more generally for those studying climate transition risks."

 """,2025.,Basel III joint regulatory constraints: interactions and implications for the financing of the economy,"988, Banque de France.","This paper examines the impact of multiple regulatory constraints on the financing of the economy in the context of the implementation of the Basel III regulation on capital and liquidity. We propose a simple theoretical model of bank lending decision to analyse the interactions between these various regulatory requirements and the conditions under which some constraints may bind while others may not. Building on the predictions of this theoretical model, we estimate the impact of these different regulatory requirements on lending growth, on a panel of 54 French banks since 2014.

We first use a randomized controlled trial to identify how fiscal news impact individual debt-to-GDP and inflation expectations. We document that the link between debt and inflation crucially depends on individuals' views about the fiscal space. News leading individuals to expect higher debt-to-GDP ratios make them more likely to revise upward their inflation expectations. These average effects are due to individuals who think that fiscal resources are more stretched than others. In contrast, individuals who think there is fiscal space do not associate debt with inflation. We then rationalize these results in a New Keynesian model where agents have heterogeneous beliefs about the fiscal space. We show that the heterogeneity of beliefs implies a policy trade-off for the central bank. Agents who expect fiscal dominance in the future exert upward pressure on inflation. An active central bank may choose to partially tolerate this higher inflation due to the real costs of completely stabilizing prices."

This degradation of biodiversity has consequences both at local level—African populations, mostly rural, are heavily dependent on ecosystem services—and at global level, given the major implications of biodiversity degradation for global warming, health, food security and global financial stability. Biodiversity conservation in Africa is therefore a major challenge, and its linkage with the continent’s economic development objectives raises a number of issues. To study this question, this paper combines geolocated data on economic activity and on a specific measure of biodiversity, namely vertebrate population counts, between 1990 and 2015. It shows that an increase in local economic activity is associated with a decline in local vertebrate populations, and discusses this result in light of the challenges facing Africa. It also documents the protection measures implemented both locally and globally to promote biodiversity preservation, as well as the challenges they face."

A difference-in-differences and a panel-event study are implemented to analyze the effect of firm entry in tax havens on firms' labor share and on each of its components. The average firm labor share experiences an increase by 2.6% over the immediate years following the establishment in a tax haven, given that domestic value added drops by 11.4%. This drop is due both to a real decline (60% of the effect) and to a mismeasurement (40% of the effect). The labor share increases despite an 8.8% decrease in its numerator, total wage bill, when MNEs enter a tax haven. Additionally, the total wage bill drop is explained by a decline in employment (-8.5%) rather than a decline in average firm wages, on which there is no effect. The mechanism at play is the ""opacity effect"" instead of the ""tax effect"" as the job cuts and tax haven entry nexus is not explained by an increase in capital intensity but rather by a restructuring decision triggering collective layoffs procedures, which are strongly regulated in France. We show that these developments are exclusively related to foreign investments in tax havens and not to other foreign investments. Given these firms' weight in the economy, we find that the presence of MNEs in tax havens accounts for around 10% of the observed increase in the aggregate share of labor in France between 1997-2014."

We show that when households are not Ricardian, fiscal requirements still exist but are very different. (1) Intertemporal budget constraints no longer impose any significant requirement on fiscal policy for price stability. A requirement derived from intertemporal budget constraints still exists, but it does not correspond to the one of the government and imposes much looser requirements on fiscal policy than in the Ricardian case. (2) Yet a second requirement exists, specific to non-Ricardian households: Public debt must remain below a threshold. Above it, its wealth effect on aggregate spending can no longer be counter-balanced by interest rate hikes, however large. This second requirement puts an upper bound on public debt regardless of future fiscal surpluses. Assessing risks of fiscal dominance is therefore very different when households are not Ricardian."

We find that workers initially employed in occupations highly exposed to Chinese competition Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“as measured by our occupational exposure index Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ experience larger declines in earnings.

The central bank then faces a difficult trade-off between containing unemployment in capital-flight countries and inflationary pressures in safe-haven ones.

Importantly, this equation can be easily estimated through two stage least squares (2SLS) and without additional data requirements relative to traditional gravity. We implement this method using bilateral trade data and find that the data strongly rejects the Independence of Irrelevant Alternative (IIA) assumption implied by standard trade models: we find an important role for vertical and geographical differentiation so that exporters with similar prices, or originating from similar regions, are closer substitutes.

Firms are authorized to transfer unused permits from one period to the next (banking), but the reverse direction (borrowing) is prohibited. Allowing for positive banking gives firms the opportunity to smooth their permit demand along the business cycle. Applications inspired by recent European Union-ETS regulations underscore the critical role of permit banking in shaping policy outcomes. For example, the 2023 cap reform would result in a more significant reduction in both permit banking and carbon emissions, as well as a 40% to 50% increase in the carbon price compared to pre-reform projections, without substantial additional GDP loss by 2060. Importantly, forgetting about permit banking when assessing cap policies would lead to both a significant underestimation of the total macroeconomic effects and an inaccurate representation of the carbon emission trajectory."

Reorganizations prove to be infrequent, made by firms employing a higher proportion of skilled workers, in manufacturing rather than in services, with a predominance of multinational firms. Even though high-skill firms are reorganizing more, reorganized business functions are less skill-intensive and more intensive in routine tasks. Activities more intensive in intangible capital are more likely to be reorganized within firm's boundaries. Last, besides reshoring in France, activities are located close to France when offshored. India, combining low-average wage and a large endowment of high-skilled workers, receives a disproportionate share of skill-intensive activities."

We estimate the model from the 1990s to 2023Q2 and derive impulse response functions and historical decomposition of endogenous variables during the pandemic-era. As Bernanke and Blanchard (2023) for the US, we find that the main driver of the post-pandemic inflation was the energy price shocks at first, followed by the food price shocks. Labour market conditions initially played a minor role in inflation, although the substantial increase in wage inflation observed between 2021Q4 and 2023Q2 can be attributed predominantly to the tightening of the labour market.

In cities like Paris, the French capital, where both affluent and low-income households reside close to the city center, UHI exposure by income follows a U-shaped curve. In contrast, in cities where affluent households live in rich suburbs, like Lyon, France's second largest city, UHI exposure decreases with income.

We assume the other coal power plants continue to operate to the end of their lifetime. We show that 70% of the capacity of the operating coal fleet should be shut down now, which corresponds to stranded assets worth $842 billion globally. Replacing the coal capacities by equivalent low-carbon capacities would imply a much larger one-off cost of $4.5 trillion worldwide. This upfront investment would also imply large debt financing costs, estimated at $3.1 trillion globally, which would drive up the total cost to $8.4 trillion. But coal plants have much higher operational costs than low-carbon ones, in part because they need fuel to operate, and the cost of CO2 emissions need to be priced. We show that cumulated net operational gains linked to replacing coal plants with low-carbon alternative to comply with the 1.5 C would amount to $3.8 trillion worldwide, thus offsetting close to half of the total costs. By lowering financing costs and increasing carbon pricing in line with the International Energy Agency s NZE scenario, the total equation could become positive, that is, total savings from the transition to clean energy would be higher than the total costs."

In this paper, we review global integrated-assessment models (IAMs) linking nature and the macroeconomy and assess their suitability to help build such scenarios. We perform an in-depth analysis of both stylised and applied IAMs, and critically assess how they represent dependencies of the macroeconomy on nature, as well as policies to reverse nature loss. We find that applied IAMs are generally skewed to capturing the dependency of the economy to selected provisioning ecosystem services, with regulating and maintenance services less represented. As these models tend to focus on the land-use and climate drivers of biodiversity loss, the transition policies they capture only aim to mitigate those drivers and overlook other drivers of nature loss such as pollution or invasive alien species. We also find that some theoretical assumptions in the core macroeconomic part of applied models may tend to mitigate the potential macroeconomic consequences of nature loss and nature transition policies. This contrasts with the results of the stylised models we review, which tend to represent the loss of natural capital and biodiversity as having significant impacts on the macroeconomy. However, stylised models make it hard to represent the impact of the loss of specific ecosystem services or specific policies to protect nature. Building on this analysis, we explore the challenges and identify future avenues for the use of IAMs in scenarios that account for the importance of nature and biodiversity for economic activity."

We create cross-country comparable measures of spatial wage disparities between and within similarly-defined local labour market areas (LLMAs) for Canada, France, (West) Germany, the UK and the US from the 1970s to 2010s, and assess their contribution to national inequality. By the end of the 2010s, spatial inequalities in LLMA average primary wages are similar in Canada, France, Germany and the UK; the US exhibits the highest degree of spatial inequality. Over the study period, spatial inequalities have nearly doubled in all countries, except for France where spatial inequalities have fallen back to 1970s levels, after an increase in the 1990s. Due to a concomitant increase in within-place inequality, the contribution of places in explaining national wage inequality has remained fairly constant over the 40-year study period, except in the UK where we document a significant increase. Whilst common global social, economic and technological shocks are important drivers of spatial inequality, this variation in levels and trends of spatial inequality opens the way to comparative research exploring the role of national institutions in mediating how global shocks translate into economic disparities between places."

Despite being heavily subsidized, insurance take-up in France remains surprisingly low. The goal of this paper is twofold; first, we explain this paradox by analyzing the heterogeneous effects of taking up crop insurance, and second, we provide concrete welfare-enhancing policy recommendations to increase insurance take-up. Using a micro-level panel of 17,000 French farmers over 20 years, we first use a moment-based regression to identify the local average treatment effects (LATE) of insurance on expected revenues and variance. Then we investigate the factors causing the heterogeneity in these effects, boThéobservable through interaction terms and unobservable through a marginal treatment effect (MTE) design. We conclude that insurance subsidies have very little impact on crop insurance demand, especially for those who would benefit the most. Finally, we suggest cost-efficient ways to increase insurance take-up based on administrative simplification, information and imitation."

We highlight the significance of an occasionally binding zero lower bound in explaining a weaker aggregate impact of asset sales relative to asset purchases. In this context, when close to the lower bound, raising the nominal interest rate prior to unwinding quantitative easing mitigates the economic costs of monetary policy normalization. Furthermore, our results imply that household heterogeneity in combination with state dependency amplifies the revealed asymmetry, while household heterogeneity alone does not enhance the aggregate effects of asset market operations."

We contribute to fill this gap by developing a detailed database documenting the origins and characteristics of shareholders of global listed companies involved in the mining of cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel and rare earths. We designed several indicators for the sake of robustness, including production- and market capitalization-weighted holding rates, complemented by indicators focusing on majority holdings thresholds. In fact, holding shares above a certain threshold allows investors to exert a strong influence on the decisions of their executive boards. We highlight the discrepancy that can prevail between the geographical distribution of production and that of investors. We also document the preponderance of strategic investors like state-owned enterprises in the ownership of CRM firms. All indicators suggest that non-EU investors control a significant share of the capital of the leading CRM mining companies.

Yet the pursuit of effective mitigation could threaten the sustainability of public debt due to the potentially huge fiscal costs of the associated policies. This paper uses a dynamic general equilibrium approach that takes into account the macroeconomic implications of the green transition and its consequences for public finances. It shows that when the government relies too heavily on expenditure-based measures, it threatens the sustainability of public debt, by increasing the probability of sovereign default, leading to higher interest rates on government bonds. This higher public default risk has potentially significant repercussions on investment financing conditions for the private sector, and increases the cost of the transition to a net-zero economy. On the other hand, carbon pricing policies make the transition more viable for public finances, at the expenses of similarly high economic costs, while remaining effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The welfare-maximizing optimal policy mix yields a balanced approach, where the share of the mitigation effort undertaken by the public sector ranges from 25% to 40% between 2030 and 2050."

This asset purchase program was effective in easing financing conditions, which translated into a compression of yields between 8 and 11 basis points for eligible firms. Eligible issuances increased but we do not find that the PEPP fostered issuance at the aggregate level.

These objectives are notably justified by the fact that land take, defined as the conversion of agricultural, forest and other semi-natural and natural land into built-up land, causes biodiversity loss and affects soil functions. Because they contribute to land take and use built-up land to produce, economic sectors will likely be affected by this new policy. This paper investigates this exposure. Using cadastral data and geolocated information on French firms, we develop accounts tracing the annual use of built-up land (a stock) and the annual land take (a flow) by economic sectors over 2008-2021. Our results show a strong time-varying sectoral heterogeneity regarding land use and land take, with some sectors (e.g. wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing or accommodation and food services) being significant users of built-up land. Regarding land take, we find that wholesale and retail trade has had the greatest responsibility. Then, we combine these new accounts with additional data and propose a multi-criteria analysis to assess the vulnerability of each sector in a severe but plausible scenario of increasing land prices induced by the NNLT policy. Our results show that the sectors contributing most significantly to land take may not necessarily be the most vulnerable because of their relatively higher adaptive capacity."

Firm heterogeneity is crucial, as the negative effect on future investment is magnified when firms are ex-ante exposed to interest rate risk, face financial constraints or lack hedging strategies. These effects operate mainly through a financing and cash flow channel, highlighting the presence of a Finance-Interest-Rate-Uncertainty multiplier, whereby the effects of this uncertainty are amplified by the presence of financial constraints.

We propose a theoretical model in which agglomeration economies affect both population and city area. A calibration exercise shows that changes in returns to agglomeration economies are not enough to generate variations in population and city area influencing significantly aggregate labour earnings.

We then identify upstream supply shocks using instrumental variables based on data outliers in the producer price series. Such shocks exhibit a more substantial and more persistent effect on downstream prices during periods of elevated inflation volatility (State 2) compared to phases of more stable consumer price growth (State 1). Similarly, monetary policy shocks are more effective in State 2. Differenti-ating regimes by the level of inflation or the shock size does not reveal state dependency. The evidence supports a model in which producers optimally invest in price flexibility. This model predicts that stricter inflation targeting reduces price flexibility and, consequently, the pass-through of all shocks to inflation, beyond the standard demand channel."

We reconsider the issue away from rational expectations, for a large class of boundedly rational expectations featuring both limited foresight and long-term learning. We show three results. (1) When restricting monetary policy to a Taylor rule, the Taylor principle does not prevent self-fulfilling inflation but hyperinflation spirals, unless for unrealistically high degrees of foresight. (2) Against hyperinflation spirals, active monetary policy can be characterized without restricting policy to a Taylor rule, as a sufficient increase of a weighted average of present and future expected policy rates. (3) The weights on future policy rates first increase but then decrease with the horizon, implying that delaying hikes too much requires larger hikes later, with a larger drop in output. Yet, being slow in hiking rates can be optimal provided a large cost on output stabilization, as it spreads the output cost over time."

Furthermore, the larger a country s share in the supply of global safe assets, the more liquid and attractive its bonds are for investors.

This paper presents an ALM-like model developed to project the evolution of the aggregate balance sheet and the interest income and expense of a banking sector under various scenarios. Based on balance sheet structure data, the model simulates the expiration of maturing instruments and the progressive accumulation of new issuances. Using conservation laws valid at the aggregate level, the model provides a consistent accounting-based framework, where bank reserve holdings depend on central bank actions, and the volume of customer deposits results from net payments between the banking sector and the rest of the economy. A combination of financial data sources makes it possible to build a simplified balance sheet of the aggregate euro area banking sector, on which the model can be run. Its total net interest income turns out to be, on the whole, positively sensitive to changes in interest rates. The model can also quantify sensitivities to other factors, such as central bank operations on securities or changes in the cost structure of customer deposits.

However, factors, such as drug offences and net shipments of banknotes also have significant effects on hidden activities even though their effects do not seem to be as strong. The NOE remains non-negligible in France, but its ratio, relative to the GDP, has decreased considerably in the 2000s.

Furthermore, the NOE indexes and GDP as well as self-employment are synchronized. We also observe positive correlations between the cyclical components of the total net issuance of banknotes and the estimated shadow economy indexes.

Over the period 1996-2019, faced with an idiosyncratic energy price increase, firms reduce their energy demand, improve their energy efficiency, increase intermediate inputs imports and optimize energy use across plants. Firms are also able to pass-through the cost shock fully into their export prices. Their production, exports and employment fall. A consequence of these multiple adjustment mechanisms is that the fall in profits is either non-significant, small or specific to only the most energy intensive firms. We also find that the impact of electricity shocks has weakened over time, suggesting that only firms able to adapt their production process to energy cost shocks have survived. Importantly, when faced with large electricity and gas price increases, firms are less able to reduce their consumption.

Lastly, we also find that i) education (returns and changes in attainment) plays a key role in shaping LTE across cohorts, and ii) differences in working time explain an increasing part of the gender gap in LTE over time as both men and women have increased the number of years they work but women have done so largely through part-time employment."

 """,2023.,International sanctions and the dollar: Evidence from trade invoicing,"924, Banque de France.","This paper shows that international sanctions can undermine the role of the US dollar in trade invoicing. The analysis is based on the episode of international sanctions targeting Russia after the invasion of regions of Ukraine in 2014. While European sanctions increased trade costs for firms located in the EU and conducting transactions with Russia, sanctions imposed by the United States affected firms located in third countries due to the extra-territoriality of the US law. This created an incentive to diversify away from the US dollar to avoid these sanctions when exporting to target countries such as Russia. The empirical exercise relies on detailed customs data for France with information on the currency of invoicing by transaction. Following the start of the Western sanctions on Russia in 2014, the propensity of French exporters to invoice their contracts in US dollars decreased. Estimation results highlight the role played by (i) strategic complementarities between firms, (ii) the diversification of Russian foreign reserves, (iii) US secondary sanctions targeting exports of dual-use goods, and (iv) threats of US secondary sanctions faced by exporters banks."

But where do fossil fuel companies stand on carbon taxes? I analyse how the 100 largest oil and gas companies communicate on carbon taxes. Surprisingly, I find that 54% of companies that have a policy view on carbon taxes support them (78% for the 50 largest). This is puzzling as an effective carbon tax should reduce revenues and reserve value of fossil fuel companies. I present a conceptual trilemma model showing that fossil fuel companies existence is threatened by a carbon tax. To understand this paradox, I offer non-mutually exclusive reasons why fossil fuel companies might support carbon taxes. Oil and gas companies could use a carbon tax to get rid of the competition from coal, create a level playing field and remove regulatory uncertainty. Or they think that these taxes will not affect them because demand for oil and gas is inelastic or that international coordination will fail and lead to leakages. Finally, it could be that this is simply a communication exercise and that a carbon tax helps them shift the responsibility for climate change from fossil fuel companies to customers, voters and elected officials."

By considering multiple scenarios, we therefore account for the uncertainty around future political decisions regarding climate change mitigation. The results show that the magnitude and duration of the macroeconomic effects of the transition to carbon neutrality will depend on the transition strategy chosen. While a number of short-term scenarios being inflationary or even stagflationary, there are also factors that could curb inflation and boost economic growth."

We find that swing pricing had only a limited impact on the financial stability of funds during the Covid-19 turmoil. By disentangling the impact of the different types of swing pricing and analyzing situations of potential acute dilution, we identify that the observed limited effectiveness of swing pricing is mainly explained by the use of swing factor cap that prevents the stabilizing effect to offset a stigma effect.

By using a narrative approach, I identify interventions when the central bank manages to reverse the exchange rate based on pure luck. I separate them from interventions when the central bank actually impacted the exchange rate. Because intervention records are daily aggregates, an intervention might appear to have changed the direction of the exchange rate, when it is more likely to have been caused by market news. This analysis allows to have a better understanding of how successful central bank operations really are. I use new daily data on Bank of England interventions in the 1980s and 1990s. Some studies find that interventions work in up to 80% of cases. Yet, by accounting for intraday market moving news, I find in adverse conditions, the Bank of England managed to influence the exchange rate only in 8% of cases. I use natural language processing to confirm the validity of the narrative approach. Using Lasso and a VAR analysis, I investigate what makes the Bank of England intervene during that period. I find that only movement on the Deutschmark and not US dollar exchange rate made the Bank intervene.

It uses the ACCL model, particularly adapted to quantify the consequences of energy price shocks and technology improvements on CO2 emissions, temperature changes, climate damage and GDP. Our simulations show that without climate policies, i.e. a business as usual scenario, the warming may be +4 to +5 C in 2100, with considerable climate damage. We also find that an acceleration in usual technical progress - not targeted at reducing greenhouse gas intensity - makes global warming and climate damage worse than the business as usual scenario. According to our estimates, the world does not achieve climate goals in 2100 without technological changes to avoid CO2 emissions. To hit such climatic targets, intervening only through the relative price of different energy types, e.g. via a carbon tax, requires challenging hypotheses of international coordination and price increase for polluting energies. We assess a multi-lever climate strategy, associating diverse price and technology measures. This mix combines energy efficiency gains, carbon sequestration, and a decrease of 3% per year in the relative price of non-carbon-emitting electricity with a 1 to 1.5% annual rise in the relative price of our four polluting energy sources (corresponding to a relatively low but achievable carbon tax scenario). None of these components alone is sufficient to reach climate objectives. Our last and most important finding is that our composite scenario achieves the climate goals."

The reliable and affordable supply of these resources is subject to supply-side risks and demand-induced pressures. This paper empirically estimates the material demand requirements for Transition-Critical Materials (TCMs) implied under two NGFS Climate Scenarios, namely the Net Zero by 2050 and Delayed Transition scenarios. We apply material intensity estimates to the underlying assumptions (e.g. with regard to technological innovation) on the deployment of low-carbon technologies to determine the implied material demand between 2021 and 2040 for nine TCMs. We find several materials to be subject to significant demand-induced pressures under both scenarios. Subsequently, the paper examines the possible emergence of material bottlenecks for three materials, namely copper, lithium and nickel. The results indicate possible substantial mismatches between supply (accounting for variables such as existing reserves, technological deployment and recycling rates) and demand, which would be further exacerbated if the transition is delayed rather than realised immediately. We discuss these findings in the context of different possible transmission channels through which these bottlenecks could affect financial and price stability, and propose avenues for future research."

We consider 17 commodity prices separately to take into account both the heterogeneity in price variations and the cross-correlations between them, and to depart from aggregate indices that use weights unrepresentative of consumption in African countries. Using local projections in a panel dataset, we find a maximum pass-through of 24%, and a long-run (18 months) pass-through of about 20%, higher than usually found in the literature, which typically uses aggregate indices. We also consider country-specific regressions to test whether estimated pass-through are related to countries observable characteristics. We find evidence that the pass-through is negatively correlated with the GDP per capita and the quality of transport infrastructure, and positively correlated with the share of food and energy in the consumption basket and the share of taxes on goods and services in government revenue. Net oil exporters, countries with larger energy subsidies and with a more independent central bank tend to have a lower pass-through. We further show that commodity-specific pass-through are correlated with the share of corresponding goods in the consumer basket."

The paper derives the dynamic IS curve analytically in a model with investment, where the interest rate channel originates both in the the savings decisions of households and the investment decisions of firms. This generalized dynamic IS curve sheds light on several new factors that shape the dependence of aggregate demand on interest rates. In particular, interest rates are discounted in investment and aggregate demand if and only if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption (IES) is low enough, and compounded if it is higher. The addition of household heterogeneity can generate discounting in aggregate consumption as well, in a new way that does not rely on precautionary savings. Instead, household heterogeneity creates discounting by making consumption respond to interest rates primarily as a ripple effect of the response of investment, not through intertemporal substitution."

As a result, an econometrician forecasting economic activity with aggregate stock market variables during the Covid-crisis is likely to get poor results. Our main contribution is thus to rely on sectorally disaggregated equity variables within a factor model in order to predict US economic activity. We find, first, that the factor model better predicts future economic activity compared to aggregate equity variables, or to conventional benchmarks used in the literature, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Second, we show that the strong performance of the factor model comes from the fact that it filters out the expected returns component of the sectoral equity variables as well as the foreign component of aggregate future cash flows. The constructed factor overweights upstream and value sectors that are found to be closely linked to the future state of the business cycle."

This effect is due to an activation effect (increased search effort, stronger for women than men), but also to a targeting effect by which treated men and women were more likely to be hired by the firms that were specifically recommended to them. In a second step, we analyze whether these partial equilibrium effects translate into positive effects on aggregate employment. Drawing on the recent literature on the econometrics of interference effects, we estimate that by redirecting the search effort of some job seekers outside their initial job market, we reduced congestion in slack markets.

Interestingly, policymakers tend to express more surprise and uncertainty with regard to developments in the real economy, whereas they are more likely to confirm their expectations with regard to inflation and monetary policy. When considering the monetary policy stance, we observe a tendency for policymakers to highlight surprise and uncertainty several meetings in advance of changes, particularly when easing monetary policy. Importantly, we document that a higher proportion of expressions of surprise and uncertainty increases the likelihood of an easier policy stance.

Similarly, aggregators that are homogeneous of arbitrary degree are equivalent to a simple generalisation of the Armington aggregator, for given steady-state trade elasticities and expenditure shares.

This study finds that city house prices in India do not converge to a single steady state, rather they form at least three clusters and converge to their respective steady state paths. The house prices are found to display conditional convergence driven by several factors, which inter alia include initial price levels, mortgage loans, and population density. The outcome of this study could be useful for policy makers in designing cluster-specific policy measures. It could also be useful for real estate fund managers, in achieving better fund diversification strategies, and the mortgage market forecasters, in reduced forecasting and modelling efforts."

We argue that the RMB can in fact develop into a consequential reserve currency in the absence of capital account convertibility. Trade and investment links can drive official use and accumulation despite limited access to Chinese financial markets. But this route to currency internationalization requires policy support. China must allow access to RMB through loans and People s Bank of China (PBoC) currency swaps. It must ensure convertibility of RMB into US dollars on offshore markets. It must provide these RMB services at a stable and predictable price. Currency internationalization without full capital account liberalization thus requires the RMB to be backed by dollar reserves, which the PBoC consequently will continue to hold and use. Hence we do not foresee RMB internationalization as supplanting dollar dominance."

For the latter, Samuelson argued that macro-returns exhibit more inefficiencies than micro-returns, as individual stories are averaged out, leaving only harder-to-eliminate macro-mispricing at the index-level. To evaluate this claim, we compare macro- and micro-predictability on US data to gauge if the former turns out higher than the latter. Additionally, we extend over time the methodology of Rapach et al. (2011) to disentangle the two sources of predictability. We first find that Samuelson's view appears incorrect, as micro-predictability is not structurally lower than macro-predictability. Second, we find that our estimated alpha- and beta-predictability indices are coherent with their corresponding theoretical implications (the alpha-predictability being high in times of bullish markets, and the beta-predictability in recessive periods), thus suggesting that the two mechanisms are at play in our dataset."

Both channels work in favour of high-income households. Calibrating the model to the US economy between 1960 and 2017, we demonstrate that the price channel has sizeable welfare effects and contributes the increase in consumption inequality that is caused by the effect of digitalization by around 25%."

When only one player is selected, the problem is re-framed as a standard optimal policy problem. We apply the algorithm to an open-economy model where a commodity importing country and a monopolistic commodity producer compete on the commodities market with barriers to entry. If the commodity price becomes relevant in production, the central bank in the commodity importing economy deviates from the first best policy to act strategically. In particular, the monetary authority tolerates relatively higher commodity price volatility to ease barriers to entry in commodity production and to limit the market power of the dominant exporter."

Both countries of EA-BDF share a common endogenous monetary policy and, thanks to our multi-country setup, we can deal with both symmetric and asymmetric shocks. Our illustrations about the effects of a government spending shock in a monetary union deliver two key results, which are robust whatever the type of expectations. First, by studying symmetric and asymmetric shocks on government spending, kept constant for 2 years, we find that, at this 2-year horizon, trade spillovers would compensate monetary policy spillovers within the euro area. Second, we also find, in the case of a symmetric shock, that the government spending multiplier is smaller under a monetary policy rule based on price-level targeting than on inflation targeting."

Changes in the performance of a few large firms can arise due to idiosyncratic shocks or idiosyncratic reactions to common shocks. This paper provides direct evidence for the second channel using data on the universe of French firm-level exports and imports over 1993-2020. Granularity matters for the micro-dynamics of aggregate French exports over the long run: the granular residual explains 42% of the variance in aggregate export growth during the period. Moreover, it co-moves with the macro shocks: the largest firms do better than average in good times and worse in bad times. Studying firm-level performance during the Great Financial Crisis and the Pandemic reveals that top exporters contributed to the export collapses disproportionably more than their pre-crisis share of exports, even within finely defined markets. We investigate the reasons for such over-reaction of the top exporters using the Pandemic as a natural experiment. We find that a higher elasticity to demand shocks explains the larger reaction of top exporters to the Pandemic, with GVC exposure having weak explanatory power. Our findings have macro implications, as they help understand the macro reaction to foreign shocks, and micro implications, since they can inform micro models of exports."

 """,2022.,State-dependent Central Bank Communication with Heterogeneous Beliefs,"875, Banque de France.","This paper studies how state-contingent central bank communication can improve welfare when externalities are at play. In the model, a central banker (CB) wants to influence the private sector beliefs, which are heterogeneous, to generate an upward bias in their action. The CB can engender such welfare-improving bias by providing public information, choosing a signalling strategy that is a function of fundamentals. To study this optimal communication strategy, I introduce heterogeneous priors in an otherwise standard Bayesian persuasion model la Gentzkow and Kamenica (2011) and characterize the dependence of optimal disclosure on the heterogeneity of beliefs. I show that heterogeneity matters in two ways: (i) it is optimal to send moderating signals, which implies sending signals with positive error probabilities in both states, and constitutes a non-trivial departure from the homogeneous beliefs case; (ii) higher dispersion in beliefs leads the monetary authority to send signals with lower error probabilities. I apply my framework to a central bank communication problem in which the policy maker communicates about aggregate conditions to influence firms' investment decisions in presence of investment externalities. I empirically validate the model's predictions by showing that the FOMC unemployment rate forecasts are systematically biased in opposite directions in recessions and expansions. Also in line with the model's predictions, the forecast biases are decreasing in the degree of private sector disagreement for each state."

We first find that conflicts are not systematic but are fairly frequent, especially in the case of supply-side and widespread shocks such as investment efficiency and bank capital shocks. Second, monetary policy and countercyclical capital requirements generate conflicts in many circumstances. By affecting interest rates, they both get in all the cracks , albeit with their respective targets generally moving in opposite directions. Nonetheless, monetary policy could reduce its adverse financial side effects by responding strongly to the output gap.

Based on a new theoretical framework, it shows that the impact of international diversification on leverage procyclicality depends on the relative performance of economies, the global business cycle and the exchange rate regime. By altering the distribution of global bank portfolio, international diversification adds a currency channel to the risk channel of the global leverage cycle. Using granular data on banks located in France, the paper shows that the pre-crisis international diversification of banks increased leverage procyclicality during the 2008-2009 crisis. Focusing on the currency channel, namely the valuation effect of currency diversification, results show that it had a negative effect on leverage procyclicality during this period, hence decreasing procyclicality. The currency channel contributed to offset part of the increased risk due to the crisis and the risk channel.

While the conceptual framework of the model remains very close to its initial version, our update takes stock of three different factors. First, since the previous version of the model, the underlying nomenclature used at the European level (ECOICOP) to define some of the main aggregates was changed, therefore requiring a careful review of the relevance of initial equations. Second, in the context of the modification in 2019 of the main semi-structural macroeconomic model used for the macroeconomic projections at Banque de France (FR-BDF), it aims at harmonizing the iterations between MAPI and FR-BDF. Finally, large variations in the wage variables in the midst of the sanitary measures related to the Covid-19 pandemics pushed us to use different concepts of wage and compensation variables. At the crossroads of these considerations, we update the model extending the estimation window, correcting specifications and input variables whenever relevant.

Workhorse monetary models, which are much forward-looking, find them so effective that they run into the so-called forward-guidance puzzle . Models that discount the future further find them much less effective, but imply that agents discount the very perception of future policy rates. This only evaluates make-up strategies when financial markets do not notice them, or deem them non-credible. We amend one leading solution to the forward-guidance puzzle -namely Woodford's finite planning horizons -to the assumption that financial markets have rational expectations on policy rates, and incorporate them into the long-term nominal interest rates faced by all. Agents still have a limited ability to foresee the consequences of monetary policy on output and inflation, making the model still immune to the forward-guidance puzzle. First, we find that make-up strategies that compensate for a past deficit of accommodation after an ELB episode have sizably better stabilization properties than inflation targeting. Second, we find that make-up strategies that always respond to past economic conditions, such as average inflation targeting, do too but that their stabilization benefits over IT can be reduced by the existence of the ELB."

The adjustment is gradual: the full pass through takes about 3 weeks. In a broad class of sticky price models, the ratio of the kurtosis over the frequency of price changes is shown to be a sufficient statistic for the cumulative impulse response of prices (CIRP) to a nominal shock. We provide evidence that the sufficient statistic prediction holds when we look at how gasoline prices respond to a common cost shock. Relating, at the gas station level, the CIRP to moments of the price change distribution, we find that the CIRP correlates with the ratio of kurtosis over frequency, but also with both frequency and kurtosis taken separately. The sign and the magnitude of the correlations are fully in line with theoretical predictions. We also show that other moments do not correlate with CIRP as robustly as the frequency and the kurtosis."

To guide our investigation, we propose a methodology to disentangle CDS positions between three strategies: hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. In our dataset, arbitrage remains anecdotal. We find that CDS reduce exposure concentration, as hedgers shed off their most concentrated exposures, while speculators substitute debt for CDS. CDS also facilitate risk-taking by speculators. Overall, CDS increase portfolio risk metrics, due to a limited effect of hedging strategies compared to speculative ones."

Covering the period from 1999 to 2024, the EA-CED contains intraday changes in euro area financial variables around 304 ECB GC policy announcements and around 4,400 IMC events, the latter being primarily speeches and interviews. We document several new empirical findings regarding the impact of IMC on financial markets. First, we show that many IMC events are associated with significant market movements, often of similar or larger magnitude than ECB policy announcements, particularly for yields at longer maturities. Significant effects are not limited to communication from the ECB president but extend to other members of the Governing Council. Second, the importance of IMC varies over time, reaching its peak around tightening cycles, particularly during 2022-2023. Third, similarly to ECB GC announcements, IMC events convey multidimensional information and lead to surprises related to the paThéof monetary policy and the state of the economy."

This paper focuses on ABS backed by auto loans or loans granted to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and explores ways to measure their climate risk based on the characteristics of the underlying loans, using existing loan-level data requirements. The ultimate goal was to come up with an alignment metric, i.e. to judge whether ABS related emissions would meet the Paris Agreements objectives, a task hindered by the lack of data available. Despite these limits, we were able to come up with relevant indicators related to ABS carbon impact, enabling the computation of ABS climate related risk proxies. Without necessarily being able to measure a concrete impact, we carved a series of indicators to serve as a reference. However, we conclude that an improved and harmonized framework for the provision of non-financial information seems essential to achieve an accurate analysis and monitoring of the financial sector's exposure to climate change."

This paper proposes a novel empirical measure of expectations anchoring based on the cross-sectional distribution of private sector inflation point forecasts. Applying this to a panel of 29 countries, it finds three main results. First, a numerical target definition per se does not improve anchoring compared to a definition of price stability, while the formulation of a numerical reference point increases the degree of anchoring. Second, point targets and hybrid target formulations are associated with better anchoring than target ranges. Third, periods of persistent target deviations lead to an increase in tail risks to the inflation outlook. Conditional on such periods, point targets and hybrid targets attenuate tail risks to the inflation outlook, with a stronger quantitative effect for point targets. The results are consistent with models suggesting that targets ranges are interpreted as zones where monetary policy is less active."

We use machine learning techniques to better account for non-linearities and interactions between variables. We then find evidence that nowcasting performances for monthly industrial production are significantly improved when relying on daily NO2 data compared to benchmark models based on PMIs and auto-regressive (AR) terms. We also find evidence of heterogeneities suggesting that the contribution of daily pollution data is particularly important during crisis episodes and that the elasticity of NO2 pollution to industrial production for a country depends on the share of manufacturing in the value added. Available daily, free-to-use, granular and covering all countries including those with limited statistics, this paper illustrates the potential of satellite-based data for air pollution in enhancing the real-time monitoring of economic activity."

The presence of the ZLB prevents the central bank from offsetting negative shocks to inflation whereas it can offset positive shocks. This asymmetry pushes average inflation below the target which in turn drags down inflation expectations and reinforces the likelihood of hitting the ZLB. We show that this deflationary bias is particularly relevant for a Central Bank with a symmetric dual mandate (i.e. minimizing deviations from inflation and employment), especially when facing demand shocks. But a strict inflation targeter cannot escape the suboptimal deflationary equilibrium either. The deflationary bias can be mitigated by targeting shortfalls instead of deviations from maximum employment and/or using flexible average inflation targeting. However, changing monetary policy strategy risks inflation expectations becoming entrenched above the target if the natural interest rate increases."

To mitigate their price impact, buyers (sellers) of an asset postpone profitable trades, exposing themselves to upward (downward) future spot price movements: buyers (sellers) would like to buy (sell) futures. However, when futures are introduced, traders also want to influence the spot price at futures maturity to increase futures payoff: this leads buyers (sellers) to sell (buy) futures. Moreover, despite the absence of market segmentation that would preclude arbitrage, the futures price can be above or below the spot price."

We first observe, using country-level data, that the share of self-employed workers in total employment is quite stable or declines over the period in all countries in our dataset, except in the three countries where large reforms promoting self-employment have been implemented, and only after these reforms. We econometrically confirm this impact on self-employment in our set of 20 industries and we find that, at the end of the period, the reforms may have increased the share of self-employed workers in total employment by 5.5pp on average in the Netherlands, 2.5pp in the United Kingdom and 2pp in France. Then, we investigate the impact of reforms on total employment and value added using a difference-in-differences approach. In spite of a broad sensitivity analysis, we find no evidence that the reforms may have impacted either total employment or value-added.These results suggest that the reforms promoting self-employment may have raised the number of self-employed workers, but mostly through a substitution effect between the self-employed and employees, and not through a supply effect or a substitution effect with informal activities.

Survey respondents are requested to report their monthly wages, which we compare to their administrative, fiscal counterparts. We propose a well-defined index of worker-level uncertainty, which filters out their potential rounding behavior and reporting biases. We estimate it using unsupervised ML/EM techniques and find that workers tend to perceive their own wages with a degree of uncertainty of around 10%. Through the lens of a simple rational signal extraction model, this amounts to estimates of workers' attention ranging from 30% to 84% depending on their wage, education, tenure and gender. Most importantly, we show that the attention of the lowest paid 30% of workers is cyclical and increases steadily by 17 percentage points in the ten days preceding payday, before immediately dropping on that day, which, through the lens of a simple model, is indicative of end-of-month financing liquidity constraints. Furthermore, this pattern reveals that the cognitive cost induced by these financing constraints arises from the not too concave (or convex) costs of achieving high levels of attention, and the convex costs of maintaining it over time."

We show that firMêmeasured productivity in France declines over the immediate years following the establishment in a tax haven, with an average estimated drop by 3.5% in labor apparent productivity. We argue that this productivity decline, following a presence in a tax haven, is most likely explained by multinationals tax optimization, where domestic productivity is underestimated as profits are not recorded anymore in the home country. The fall in productivity is especially strong for firms that are intensive in intangible capital and is equivalent to 4.1% (versus 2.7% for low intangible intensive firms), reflecting the fact that these types of assets are more easily shifted across countries and facilitate tax planning. Our results additionally suggest that the mismeasurement has strong dynamic effects, as the decline becomes more important the longer the firm remains in a tax haven. Finally, given these firms weight in the economy, our results imply an 8% loss at the aggregate in terms of the level of the labor productivity throughout the whole sample period, which is equivalent to an annual loss of 9.7% in terms of the aggregate annual labor productivity growth."

Calibrating the model to the euro area economy, we find that the difference in the initial response of GDP to positive and negative economic shocks of similar amplitude can reach up to 25%. This means that a central bank would have to cut its policy rate much more to obtain a symmetric medium-run impact on GDP. We also show that downward interest rate rigidity is stronger when policy rates are stuck at their effective lower bound, further disrupting monetary policy transmission.

Exploring Biodiversity-Related Financial Risks in France,"826, Banque de France."," This paper contributes to an emerging literature aimed at uncovering the linkages between biodiversity loss and financial instability, by exploring biodiversity-related financial risks (BRFR) in France. We first build on previous studies and propose an analytical framework to understand BRFR, emphasizing the complexity involved and the limited substitutability of natural capital. We then provide quantitative estimates of dependencies and impacts of the French financial system on biodiversity. We find that 42% of the value of securities held by French financial institutions comes from issuers that are highly or very highly dependent on one or more ecosystem services. We also find that the accumulated terrestrial biodiversity footprint of these securities is comparable to the loss of at least 130,000 km of pristine nature, which corresponds to the complete artificialization of 24% of the area of metropolitan France. Finally, we suggest avenues for future research through which these estimates could feed into future assessments of physical and transition risks."

Relative price trends shift the optimal inflation target up from a level of zero percent, as suggested by the standard sticky price literature, to a range of 1.1%- 2.1% in France, 1.2%-2.0% in Germany, 0.8%-1.0% in Italy, and 1.1-1.7% in the Euro Area (three country average). Differences across countries emerge due to systematic differences in the strengThéof relative price trends. Other considerations not taken into account in the present paper may push up the optimal inflation targets further. The welfare costs associated with targeting zero inflation turn out to be substantial and range between 2.1% and 4.5% of consumption in present-value terms."

Significant dispersion in changes in net debt prevails both between and within industries, before as well as after public support. We show that the probability to experience a negative liquidity shock - as well as the intensity of this shock - are negatively correlated with the initial credit quality of the firm (based on Banque de France internal ratings). Our model also finds that public support dampens significantly the impact of Covid on the dispersion of liquidity shocks and brings back the distribution of liquidity shocks closer to its pre-crisis path but with fatter tails."

Finally, we leverage our monthly firm-level data on sales to show how corporate activity has evolved along four distinct trajectories throughout 2020. The main determinant of belonging to a given profile of activity is the firm industry defined at a very granular level. Conditional on industry, the activity trajectory is also correlated with the ability to adapt some firms have demonstrated during the crisis in terms of organization and production."

We show that a tolerance band should not be a zone of inaction: the lack of reaction within the band endangers macroeconomic stability and leads to the possibility of multiple equilibria; the trade-off between the reaction needed outside the range versus inside seems unfavorable: a very strong reaction, when inflation is far from the target, is required to compensate a moderately lower reaction within tolerance band; these results, obtained within the framework of a stylized model, are robust to many alterations, in particular allowing for the zero lower bound."

We assess how customers of different banks react to this trade liberalization episode using detailed information on the bilateral tariff cuts and disaggregated data on French export flows at the firm-product level. We find robust evidence that the specialized lenders help exporters to respond more strongly to changes in tariffs.

Thus, the larger the proportion of firms' debt denominated in foreign currency is, the higher the fiscal multiplier. In contrast, the terms of trade deteriorate when home bias is low. This increases the real debt burden and the external finance premium. Hence, in this case, the fiscal multiplier decreases as the share of firms' debt denominated in foreign currency increases."

Under an unchanged monetary policy rule, an increase in the inflation target of eight tenth the size of the drop in the real natural rate of interest is warranted. Absent an increase in the inflation target, and assuming the effective lower bound prevents the ECB from implementing more aggressive negative interest rate policies, adjusting the monetary strategy requires considering alternative instruments or policy rules, such as committing to make-up for recent, below-target inflation realizations."

This paper assesses the interest of a procedure distinct from that for insolvent firms. It is based on the French experience, where a preventive procedure has coexisted with the more common restructuring procedure since 2006. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the Commercial Courts' decisions allows the identification of the causal impact of the conversion from the preventive procedure to the common one on the firm's survival chances. Using an (almost) exhaustive sample of preventive bankruptcy fillings over 2010-2016, we show that conversion reduces the probability of firm survival by 50 p.p., which corresponds to indirect bankruptcy costs of around 20% of the firm assets. Our interpretation is that the low restructuring rate under the common bankruptcy procedure may alarm some of the firm's stakeholders, especially its customers. This in turn aggravates the firm's difficulties and reduces its chances of restructuring under the common procedure. We provide some empirical evidence to support this interpretation. A distinct preventive procedure helps prevent this spiral."

The comparison is made along two sets of criterias capturing : the ability to pass compliance tests used by the regulators during on-site missions of model validation (i), and the induced changes in capital requirement (ii). The different models show noticeable differences in their ability to pass the regulatory tests and to lead to a reduction in capital requirement.

We apply this to population administrative firm panel data from France, where many labour regulations apply to firms with 50 or more employees. Nonparametrically, we find that there is a sharp fall in the fraction of innovating firms just to the left of the regulatory threshold. Further, a dynamic analysis shows a sharp reduction in the firm's innovation response to exogenous demand shocks for firms just below the regulatory threshold. We then quantitatively fit the parameters of the model to the data, finding that innovation at the macro level is about 5.4% lower due to the regulation, a 2.2% consumption equivalent welfare loss. Four-fifths of this loss is due to lower innovation intensity per firm rather than just a misallocation towards smaller firms and lower entry. We generalize the theory to allow for changes in the direction of R&D, and find that regulation's negative effects only matter for incremental innovation (as measured by citations and text-based measures of novelty). A more regulated economy may have less innovation, but when firms do innovate they tend to swing for the fence with more radical (and labour saving) breakthroughs."

Using data from WIOD on a sample of 43 countries, we find that the mean output-weighted elasticity of the HCE deflator to the exchange rate increased in absolute value from 0.075 in 2000 to 0.094 in 2008. After peaking in 2008, it declined to 0.088 in 2014. World Input-Output tables (WIOT hereafter) are released with a lag of several years and the latest WIOT dates back to 2015. To fill this gap, we approximate the impact of an exchange rate shock on the HCE deflator from 2016 onwards using up-to-date GDP and trade data. Our extrapolations suggest that the decline in the elasticity of the HCE deflator continued until 2016, before reversing in 2017 and 2018. Our findings are robust to using three different datasets."

Quantifying Public Good Spillovers,"796, Banque de France.","Despite long-standing theoretical interest, empirical attempts at investigating the appropriate level of decentralization remain scarce. This paper develops a simple and flexible framework to test for the presence of public good spillovers between fiscally autonomous jurisdictions and to investigate potential welfare gains from marginal fiscal integration. We build a quantitative spatial equilibrium model with many local jurisdictions, mobile households and endogenous local public goods causing spillovers across jurisdictional boundaries. We show how one can exploit migration and housing price responses to shocks in local public goods at different geographic scales to reveal the intensity of spillovers. Applying our framework to the particularly fragmented French institutional setting, we structurally estimate the model using a unique combination of municipal administrative panel datasets. Estimation relies on plausibly exogenous variations in government subsidies to instrument changes in the supply of public goods. We find that public goods in a municipality account for 4--11\% of the local public good bundle enjoyed by its residents, and that public goods in each neighbor municipality account for an average 3.2--3.5\% of this bundle. Finally, we simulate the effect of a reform increasing fiscal integration and find substantial welfare gains."

We find that the effects of euro area stress shocks are significant not only for the euro area but also for the rest of the world. Notably, an increase in euro area stress entails a slowdown of economic activity in the rest of the world, as well as a fall in imports/exports of both the euro area and the rest of the world. A decrease in euro area stress has somewhat more widespread beneficial effects on both economic performance and global trade activity."

To complement these models, a semi-structural vector autoregression model is proposed in which only supply shocks are identified. The accuracy of the output gap estimates is assessed based on their performance in predicting recessions. The models with financial variables generally produce more accurate output gap estimates at the expense of increased real-time volatility. While the extended Hodrick-Prescott filter is particularly appealing for its real-time stability, it lags behind the two semi-structural models in terms of forecasting performance. The vector autoregression model augmented with financial variables features the best in-sample forecasting performance, and it has similar real-time prediction capabilities to the semi-structural unobserved components model.

Against this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to explore one potential approach to factoring climate-related transition risks into a central bank s collateral framework. Given the radical uncertainty associated with measuring such risks, this approach relies on so-called climate alignment methodologies, which enable to assess the consistency of eligible and pledged marketable assets with specific climate targets. Moreover, this paper proposes a climate-hedging portfolio approach : instead of seeking to align the collateral on an asset-by-asset basis, central banks could aim for alignment , in aggregate, of the collateral pools pledged by their counterparties with a given climate target. The rationale for this choice is that assessing climate-related risk at the pool level avoids the Eurosystem having to decide on which assets/issuers in the pools should be excluded or capped, and is therefore more compatible with a market neutrality approach. The numerical experiment using Eurosystem marketable criteria data suggests that, in aggregate, neither the Eurosystem eligible collateral universe nor the collateral pledged is aligned with the climate targets of the European Union. From this perspective, the Eurosystem marketable collateral can be considered to be exposed to climate-related transition risks. We discuss the potential practical implications of aiming to align collateral pools, and suggest avenues for further work."

Breaking down our sample, we show that models with weekly data have similar nowcasting performances relative to other models during normal times but strongly outperform them during crisis episodes (2008-2009 and 2020). We finally construct a nowcasting model of annual world GDP growth incorporating weekly data which give timely (one every week) and accurate forecasts (close to IMF and OECD projections, but with a 1 to 3 months lead). Policy-wise, this model can provide an alternative benchmark projection for world GDP growth during crisis episodes when sudden swings in the economy make the usual benchmark projections (from the IMF or the OECD) rapidly outdated."

The paper briefly presents the six categories of plans. It then highlights their common features as well as their differences, showing that the differences are more numerous than the common features. The criticisms voiced against the different formulations of 100% Reserves are exposed, adding those of the author and distinguishing between the doubts expressed on the validity of the analysis on one hand, and some undesirable consequences of the reform on the other. In spite of these criticisms, it then shown that the 100% Reserve reform is becoming topical, with recent private sector, central banks and political initiatives that relate to it.

Second, these hikes affect all European banks proportionally to their exposure to the country of activation.

Furthermore, these multipliers decline in absolute value as the level of labour informality increases in the economy, although evidences are less robust for spending-based consolidations. An analysis of the effects of tax-based consolidations on private demand suggests that labour market informality constitutes a short-term social buffer that attenuates the contractionary effects of this type of policy by increasing investment opportunities through tax evasion and entrepreneurial alternatives to unemployment for dismissed workers."

First, we estimate a non-linear model generating impulse responses that depend on the evolution of households' Debt to Service Ratio, i.e. the fraction of income that households use to pay back their debt. Second, we use sign restrictions to jointly identify a wide set of financial and economic shocks. We find that financial vulnerability: i) amplifies the response of the economy to housing shock, ii) makes the response to expansionary credit shocks less persistent and even negative after the first year since the arrival of the shock. Finally, overall recessionary shocks have larger effects with respect to expansionary ones of the same size."

The common wisdom is that, as the short-term interest rate nears its effective lower bound, monetary policy cannot do much to stimulate the economy. However, central banks have resorted to alternative instruments, such as QE, credit easing and forward guidance. Using state-of-the-art estimates of the effects of monetary policy, we show that monetary easing stimulates output and inflation, also during the period when short-term interest rates are near their lower bound.

To do so, we use a static multi-sector general equilibrium model including France, the rest of the European Union and the rest of the world to simulate the impact of carbon tax scenarios on economic activity. We find that a tax increase on sectors' and households' greenhouse gas emissions corresponding to a carbon price of 100 euros per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent entails a decrease in French aggregate real value added by 1.2% at a 5-to10-year horizon when implemented in France only, vs. 1.5% when implemented in the whole EU. Impacts on sectoral real value added range from -20% to negligible. The most affected sectors are generally the most polluting ones, but the tax also propagates across sectors via intermediate inputs. Specifically, the network structure tends to affect comparatively more upstream sectors than downstream ones, given their taxation levels. International financial markets also play an important role by neutralizing the positive response of final demand that would result from the redistribution of the tax proceeds to domestic households."

It adopts a supply-side, long-term view, with 2060 and 2100 horizons. It is a global projection tool (30 countries / regions), with assumptions and results both at the world and the country / regional level. Five different types of energy inputs are taken into account according to their CO2 emission factors. Full calibration is possible at each stage, with estimated or literature-based default parameters. In particular, Total Factor Productivity (TFP), which is a major source of uncertainty on future growth and hence on CO2 emissions, is endogenously determined, with a rich modeling encompassing energy prices, investment prices, education, structural reforms and decreasing return to the employment rate. We present four scenarios: Business As Usual (BAU), with stable energy prices relative to GDP price; Decrease of Renewable Energy relative Price (DREP), with the relative price of non CO2 emitting electricity decreasing by 2% a year; Low Carbon Tax (LCT) scenario with CO2 emitting energy relative prices increasing by 1% per year; High Carbon Tax (HCT) scenario with CO2 emitting energy relative prices increasing by 3% per year. At the 2100 horizon, global GDP incurs a loss of 12% in the BAU, 10% in the DREP, 8% in the Low Carbon Tax scenario and 7% in the High Carbon Tax scenario. This scenario exercise illustrates both the tragedy of the horizon , as gains from avoided climate change damage net of damage from mitigating policies are negative in the mediumterm and positive in the long-term, and the tragedy of the commons , as climate change damage is widely dispersed and particularly severe in developing economies, while mitigating policies should be implemented in all countries, especially in advanced countries modestly affected by climate change but with large CO2 emission contributions."

To rationalize this cautious approach, Brainard s attenuation principle is often invoked: when a policy-maker is unsure of the effects of his policies, he should react less than he would under certainty. We show that the Brainard principle, while a wise recommendation for policy-making in general, runs into a pitfall when it is applied to a central bank setting monetary policy. For a central bank, concerns over uncertainty create a cautiousness bias: acting less is justified when taking as given the private sector s expectations of inflation, but acting less shifts these inflation expectations away from the central bank s inflation target. In response to the de-anchoring of expectations, the central bank can easily end up acting as much as it is initially reluctant to do, but without succeeding in putting inflation back on target. This pattern is a feature of policy under discretion: the central bank would often be better off tying its hands not to listen to its concerns about uncertainty."

We find that job-to-job flows and the associated gain tend to be larger in high-skilled occupations and for permanent workers.

Guided by theory, we provide evidence consistent with these effects operating through reallocations across firms in the presence of distortions. (i) Both export and import expansion increase average firm productivity, but the former also shifts activity towards more productive firms, while the latter acts in reverse. (ii) Both export and import exposure raise the productivity threshold for survival, but this cut-off is not a sufficient statistic for aggregate productivity.

If this view is correct, stabilization policy, by dampening these fluctuations, can raise the average level of activity. We show that the dynamics of the unemployment rate in the US display a striking asymmetry that strongly favors the plucking model: increases in unemployment are followed by decreases of similar amplitude, while the amplitude of the increase is not related to the amplitude of the previous decrease. We develop a microfounded plucking model of the business cycle. The source of asymmetry in our model is downward nominal wage rigidity, which we embed in an explicit search model of the labor market. Our search framework implies that downward nominal wage rigidity is consistent wiThéoptimizing behavior and equilibrium.

However, lending to SMEs across more or less carbon-intensive industries remained unrelated to banks' commitments to green their business.

Banks are competitive and subject to reserve requirements in a corridor rate system with deposit and lending facilities. Banks face counterparty risk in the unsecured market and incur an opportunity cost to pledge collateral. The model provides insights on interest rates, trading volumes and substitution between the two markets. Using transaction data on the Euro money market, we provide new empirical findings that the model accounts for: (i) borrowing banks are active on both markets even when their collateral constraint is not binding, (ii) secured interest rates may fall below the deposit facility rate. We derive and empirically test predictions on how ""conventional"" and ""unconventional"" monetary policies impact interbank markets, depending on whether marketable collateral is purchased or not."

Though standardization can be beneficial for domestic producers, divergent product standards have been categorized as a major obstacle to international trade. This paper quantifies the effect of standard harmonization on trade flows and characterizes the extent to which it changes the cost and demand structure of exporting. Creating a novel and comprehensive database on crosscountry standard equivalences, we identify standard harmonization events at the document level. Our results show that the introduction of harmonized standards increases trade through a larger sales volume of existing exporters (intensive margin) and more entry (extensive margin). These findings are consistent with a multi-country heterogeneous firm model featuring endogenous standard adoption. Because of additional demand, standard harmonization raises firms incentives to produce varieties in accordance with the standard despite high sunk investment costs. Firms export sales expand and entry into foreign markets is encouraged."

In principle professional networks could be relevant both because they are rewarded by the employer and because they facilitate job mobility. Our econometric analysis suggests that, although there is a substantial positive correlation between network size and executive compensation, with an elasticity of around 20%, almost all of this is due to unobserved individual characteristics. The true causal impact of networks on compensation is closer to an elasticity of 1 or 2% on average, all of this due to enhanced probability of moving to a higher-paid job. And there appear to be strongly diminishing returns to network size."

Fiscal policy persistently affects the size of the informal economy, which impact future fiscal revenues and thus default risk. This mechanism captures a key empirical regularity of economies with imperfect tax enforcement: the low sensitivity of debt price to fiscal consolidations. The interaction of imperfect tax enforcement and limited commitment strongly constrains the dynamics of optimal fiscal policy. During default crises, high tax distortions force the government towards extreme fiscal policies, notably including costly austerity spells."

According to estimates derived from propensity score matching, MFS adoption decreases the informal sector size in a range of 2.4 4.3 percentage points of GDP. These formalization effects may stem from different possible transmission channels: improvement in credit access, increase in the productivity/profitability of informal firms attenuating subsistence constraints typical of entrepreneurship in the informal sector, as well as possible induced growThéof firms already in the formal sector.

In this paper, we document new empirical findings on the effect of MW on wage rigidity using quarterly micro wage data matched with sectoral bargained MW. We estimate a micro empirical model of wage rigidity taking into account minimum wage dynamics and we use a simulation method to investigate implications of lumpy micro wage adjustment for the aggregate wage dynamics. Our main findings are the following. Both national and sectoral MW have a large effect on the timing and on the size of wage adjustments. At the aggregate level, MW contribute to amplify, by a factor of 1.7, the response of wages to past inflation. Ignoring MW leads to underestimate the speed of aggregate wage adjustment by about a year. The elasticities of wages with respect to past inflation, the national MW and industry-level MW are respectively 0.42, 0.17 and 0.16. Finally, there are significant spillover effects of the NMW on higher wages transiting through industry-level MW."

With low-income countries (LICs) being the most vulnerable to large and frequent terms of trade shocks, the paper focuses on a sample of 38 LICs over the period 1978-2012 and finds that banking sector development acts as a shock-absorber in poor countries, dampening the transmission of terms of trade shocks to growth volatility. Expanding the sample to 121 developing countries confirms this result, although this role of shock-absorber fades away as economies grow richer. Stock market development, by contrast, appears neither to be a shock-absorber nor a shock-amplifier for most economies. These findings are consistent across a range of econometric estimators, including fixed effect, system GMM and local projection estimates."

Our results point to changes in the degree of financial frictions. We discuss the implications of this structural interpretation and show that the expectation effect of regime switching in financial conditions is an important component of the financial accelerator mechanism.

Our analysis considers a sample of 146 countries over the period 1970-2013, and reveals that extremely restrictive policy frameworks are likely to increase the expected cost of banking crises. By contrast, by combining discipline and flexibility, some policy arrangements such as budget balance rules with an easing clause, intermediate exchange rate regimes or an inflation targeting framework may significantly contain the cost of banking crises. As such, we provide evidence on the benefits of constrained discretion for the real impact of banking crises."

Beyond the role of macroeconomic and institutional factors (real estate prices, interest rates, term of loans granted, etc.), a decomposition of changes in ownership rates over the period using the Oaxaca-Blinder method highlights the role of changes in family structures (increasing proportion of single-parent families, decline in the share of couples with children in the most modest households) and the sharp decline in small rural home ownership. Family support gift assistance, inheritance and other forms of aid also played an important part in the 2000s: four out of ten recent homeowners benefited from it, two out of ten even receiving direct financial assistance for their purchase. This support increased significantly among wealthier households during the 2000s, contributing to a widening gap with the share of homeowners in the least well off populations."

We notably construct firm-level measures of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) that account for industry-specific values of the cost of equity and reflect the actual capital structure of firms. We find a confirmation that a high WACC drags down investment: a one SD increase in the real WACC (+2 pp) is associated on average with a reduction by 0.65 pp in the investment rate. The effect is somewhat larger for manufacturing firms and when firms are highly leveraged or more dependent on external finance.

Using a large sample of French corporate bonds held by funds, we run panel data regressions at the bond-level to explain their yields by macroeconomic variables, such as the sovereign 10-y rate, the short-term rate, the Vstoxx as well as bond-specific variables, such as the residual maturity, liquidity and the issuer s probability of default. We also account for the corporate securities purchasing programme (CSPP) implemented by the ECB since June 2016 by adding dummy variables on the eligible bonds. Then we add variables related to inflows/outflows to test for several hypotheses. First, our results show that flows to funds affect the yields of all corporate bonds across the board. Second, this effect is asymmetric since outflows have a greater impact on yields than inflows. Third, the greater the funds market share in a specific bond the higher the impact on this bond is. These three results are robust to change in econometric specification. Further estimations suggest that withdrawals may raise liquidity premia and ownership by funds could amplify the response of bond yields to financial stress, although these two latter results are not significant in all econometric specifications."

However, the experience of advanced small open economies (AEs), like the ones of the Euro Area periphery, points to the opposite, i.e., capital inflows lead to lower productivity, possibly because of entry of less productive firms. We measure capital flow shocks as exogenous variations in world real interest rates. We show that, in the data, lower real interest rates lead to lower productivity only in AEs, whereas the opposite holds for EMEs. We build a business cycle model with firms' heterogeneity, financial imperfections and endogenous productivity. The model combines a cleansing effect, stemming from capital outflows (inflows), with an original sin effect, whereby capital outflows (inflows), via a real exchange rate depreciation (appreciation), decreases (increases) the opportunity cost of producing for less productive firms and the borrowing ability of the incumbent, marginally more productive firms. The estimation of the model reveals that a low trade elasticity combined with high (low) firms' productivity dispersion in EMEs (AEs) are crucial ingredients to account for the different effects of capital flows across groups of countries. The relative balance of the cleansing and the original sin effect is able to simultaneously rationalize the evidence in both EMEs and AEs."

It occurs in particular with a persistent deleveraging shock, leading investors to hold cash yielding a low return. Policy implications differ from shorter-run analyses implied by nominal rigidities.

Affine approximations are not nested in conventional perturbations of arbitrary order. We apply this technique to models featuring Campbell-Cochrane habits, recursive preferences, and time-varying disaster risk.

We start by describing the recent evolution of the four main items constituting the French IIP; namely Portfolio Investments, Other Investments, Derivatives and Direct Investments. We observe ample, albeit temporary, variations of these items surrounding QE programs. This analysis is complemented by an econometric approach in which we consider as QE variables both the announcements of the programs and their actual implementation. QE measures do impact all the items of the French IIP. Announcements and particularly the one of January 2015 play a stronger role compared to the amounts purchased. We also decompose changes in the IIP into flows and valuation effects and show that the latter is the most reactive to QE measures. Finally, we establish counterfactual scenarios to quantify what France s IIP would have been in the absence of QE. The strong impact observed following the announcement of January 2015 is rapidly counterbalanced; which suggests an over-adjustment phenomenon at the beginning of the program. This analysis allows estimating the outcome of the policy on the net IIP and thus on international wealth transfer. Consistently wiThéour previous findings, we observe a robust impact at the beginning of the program which is then partly offset."

 """,2018.,The Inverted-U Relationship Between Credit Access and Productivity Growth,"696, Banque de France.","In this paper, we identify two counteracting effects of credit access on productivity growth: on the one hand, better access to credit makes it easier for entrepreneurs to innovate; on the other hand, better credit access allows less efficient incumbent firms to remain longer on the market, thereby discouraging entry of new and potentially more efficient innovators. We first develop a simple model of firm dynamics and innovation-based growth with credit constraints, where the above two counteracting effects generate an inverted-U relationship between credit access and productivity growth. Then, we test our theory on a comprehensive French manufacturing firmlevel dataset. We first show evidence of an inverted-U relationship between credit constraints and productivity growth when we aggregate our data at sectoral level. We then move to firm-level analysis, and show that incumbent firms with easier access to credit experience higher productivity growth, but that they also experienced lower exit rates, particularly the least productive firms among them. To confirm our results, we exploit the 2012 Eurosystem's Additional Credit Claims (ACC) program as a quasi-experiment that generated exogenous extra supply of credits for a subset of incumbent firms."

We find FDI to lead to a creative destruction phenomenon, with a short-term crowding out effect on domestic investment, followed by a long-term crowding in. Greenfield FDI develops stronger long run complementarities with domestic investment, while mergers and acquisitions do not show a significant effect on domestic investment. Financial development seems to mitigate crowding out pressures and even foster a crowding in for mergers and acquisitions."

Because the SRTC is effective after an incubation period , we make a distinction between short and long-term causality, following the methodology proposed by Dufour and Taamouti (2010). We find that causality from monetary policy to systemic risk, while not significant in the very short term, robustly represents 75 to 100% of the total dependence between the two variables in the long run. Reverse causality is rejected: systemic risk did not influence the policy of the European Central Bank before the global financial crisis. However, central banks must be aware that a too loose monetary policy stance may be conducive to a build-up of systemic risk."

An efficient policy should provide unemployment insurance benefits funded by experience rated employers contributions instead of short-time work benefits.

To understand their operating mechanisms, we first provide a model showing that short-time work may save jobs in firms hit by strong negative revenue shocks, but not in less severely-hit firms, where hours worked are reduced, without saving jobs. The cost of saving jobs is low because short-time work targets those at risk of being destroyed. Using extremely detailed data on the administration of the program covering the universe of French establishments, we devise a causal identification strategy based on the geography of the program that demonstrates that short-time work saved jobs in firms faced with large drops in their revenues during the Great Recession, in particular when highly levered, but only in these firms. The measured cost per saved job is shown to be very low relative to that of other employment policies."

The M line tariff, a tariff on cereals introduced in 1892, was a major protectionist shock that shifted relative prices in favor of agriculture and away from industry. In a context in which the latter was more intensive in skills than agriculture, the tariff reduced the relative return to education, which in turn affected parents decisions about the quantity and quality of children. We use regional differences in the importance of cereal production in the local economy to estimate the impact of the tariff. Our findings indicate that the tariff reduced enrollment in primary education and increased birthrates and fertility. The magnitude of these effects was substantial. In regions with average shares of employment in cereal production, the tariff offset the (downward) trend in birthrates for 13 years; in those with the highest cereal employment shares, there was a delay of up to 22 years."

We further show that while non-base wage components exhibit some degree of downward rigidity, they do so to a lesser extent than base wages."

On the one hand a positive shock increases market size and therefore innovation incentives for all firms. On the other hand it increases competition as more firms enter the export market. This in turn reduces profits and therefore innovation incentives particularly for firms with low productivity. Overall the positive impact of the export shock on innovation is magnified for high productivity firms, whereas it may negatively affect innovation in low productivity firms. We test this prediction with patent, customs and production data covering all French manufacturing firms. To address potential endogeneity issues, we construct firm-level export proxies which respond to aggregate conditions in a firm's export destinations but are exogenous to firm-level decisions. We show that patenting robustly increases more with export demand for initially more productive firms. This effect is reversed for the least productive firms as the negative competition effect dominates."

While the usual measures of mark-up rate implicitly assume perfect labor markets, our approach relaxes this assumption, and takes into account that part of firms rent created in an industry is shared with workers to an extent which can vary with their skills. Our results are based on a cross-country-industry panel covering 14 OECD countries and 19 industries over the 1985-2005 period. In a first part of our analysis we draw on OECD indicators of product and labor market (anticompetitive) regulations to test how they are related to our new measures of mark-up and rent-sharing. We find that anti-competitive Non-Manufacturing Regulations (NMR) affect mark-up rates positively, and hence firms rent creation and workers share of rent, whereas Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) has no impact on rent creation, but boosts workers wages per hour. However, we observe that these wage increases are offset by a negative impact from EPL on hours worked per output unit, leading to a non-significant impact of EPL on workers share of rents. The effects of EPL for low-skilled workers appear to be more pronounced than those for medium-skilled workers, both being much greater than for highly-skilled workers. In the second part of our analysis, we estimate the impacts of our new measures on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in the framework of a straightforward regression model. We use the OECD regulations indicators as relevant instrument to take care of endogeneity and to make sure that the resulting estimates assess the proper regulation impacts of rent creation and sharing without being biased by other confounding effects. We find that less competition in the product and labor markets as assessed by our measures of mark-up and workers share of rents have both substantial negative impacts on TFP."

These delays are important in that they can propagate other delays, thus prompting concerns that they could cause system gridlock. This paper characterizes the delays in the TARGET2 and analyzes whether delays in incoming transactions could cause delays in outgoing transactions. We distinguish between the potentially mechanical pass-through of delays and the reaction of one bank to its delaying counterparty, and we propose a set of instruments to tackle endogeneity issues. We find evidence that delays do propagate downstream; however, in most cases the effect is rather limited. As for delaying strategies on a payment-by-payment basis, contrary to the theoretical literature, the data show only very weak evidence.

Our approach allows us not only to assess the uncertainty surrounding the optimal inflation target, but also to determine the latter while taking into account the parameter uncertainty facing the policy maker, including uncertainty with regard to the determinants of the steady-state real interest rate.

However, the positive effects may be outweighed by adverse effects of excessive competition (lower profit margins, increased risk incentives).

We find that traditional global indicators such as oil prices and import prices provide more accurate information for euro area headline inflation than global slack measures. In what regards the forecast ability of the Phillips curve for headline inflation, we show that it is unstable and depends strongly on the time period. Global factors provide only limited additional information for forecasting. In addition, we explore whether domestic demand and global factors are useful for analysing the entire conditional distribution of euro area inflation. We find that their impact varies across inflation quantiles (low vs. high inflation) and that inflation is more persistent at the low end of the distribution. We provide evidence that quantile information can lead to more accurate forecasts in periods of persistently low inflation."

Using data on firms operating in France, we highlight that, at the technological frontier, productivity has accelerated, especially over the recent period, which contradicts the hypothesis of a decline in innovation. The most productive firms in a given year do not, however, improve their relative advantage. The convergence of firms productivity does not seem to have slowed down in the 2000s, which does not confirm the hypothesis of a decrease in the dissemination of innovation. On the other hand, the dispersion of productivity between firms has increased, which suggests growing difficulties in reallocating production factors, labour and capital, between firms."

In this paper we assess the impact of uncertainty fluctuations on the interconnectedness within the international system of equity prices. In this respect, we extend the measure of connectedness put forward by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) by allowing for non-linear effects through the estimation of a non-linear Threshold VAR model whose regimes depend on the level on uncertainty. Results clearly show that high uncertainty tends to generate more connectedness among equity indexes of a set of advanced and emerging countries. From an economic policy point of view, this result suggests that in the presence of high uncertainty, an adverse financial shock in a specific country is likely to propagate more widely and more strongly to the whole financial system. This result advocates for a close real-time monitoring of uncertainty measures."

 """,2018.,"Exchange Rate Movements, Firm-Level Exports and Heterogeneity","660, Banque de France.","This paper provides an estimation of the reaction of firm-level exports consecutive to real exchange rate movements, the exchange rate elasticity of exports. Following recent theoretical works emphasizing the role played by firm heterogeneity, we test in particular how the exchange rate elasticity may be affected by firm-level productivity, and how the heterogeneous reaction of different firms may contribute to shape the aggregate reaction of countries' exports. The analysis relies on a unique cross-country micro-based dataset of exporters available for 11 European countries (2001-2011), which details in particular information about firms' productivity and export performance. Our results show that while the average exchange rate elasticity across firms is quite weak, it is also highly heterogeneous. The least productive firms within each country and sector tend to react more to real exchange rate movements than the most productive firms. This weak reaction of highly productive and large exporters tends to reduce the macroeconomic exchangerate elasticity in all countries. Cross-country differences in the shape of the productivity distribution among exporters have a strong influence on the macroeconomic exchange rate elasticity: countries populated with a higher density of low productive firms tend to respond more to exchange rate movements in terms of aggregate exports than countries populated with highlyproductive exporters."

I provide an exact decomposition of allocational inefficiency into three components: labor misallocation, capital misallocation, and a third term representing the interplay between both. Misallocation increased substantially between 1997 and 2007, generating a loss in annual TFP growThéof roughly 0.8 percentage points. This increase is mainly related to labor misallocation, except at the beginning of the 2000s, when capital misallocation played the leading role. The impact of allocational efficiency during the Great Recession is sizeable: misallocation accounts for roughly 25% of the 2007-2009 decline in TFP and 20% of the improvement observed in the immediate aftermaThéof the crisis. The main feature behind the rise in misallocation during the crisis is the predominance of the interplay component, which is stable the rest of the time. It suggests that one should pay special attention to mechanisms disrupting both labor and capital markets in the wake of financial crises. Finally, allocational efficiency remains rather constant after 2010: the post-crisis slowdown in productivity growth is therefore even more pronounced for efficient TFP than for observed TFP."

Holding the sourcing strategy fixed, we find that larger firms (i) have lower import shares, (ii) concentrate their import spending on their top varieties and (iii) pay higher prices for their imported inputs.

 """,2017.,A Kinked-Demand Theory of Price Rigidity,"656, Banque de France.","I provide a microfounded theory for one of the oldest, but so far informal, explanations of price rigidity: the kinked demand curve theory. Assuming that some customers observe at no cost only the price of the store they happen to be at gives rise to a kink in firms' demand curves: a price increase above the market price repels more customers than a price decrease attracts. The kink in turn makes a range of prices consistent with equilibrium, but a selection criterion that captures firms' reluctance to be the first to change prices---the adaptive rational-expectations criterion---selects a unique equilibrium where prices stay constant for a long time. The kinked-demand theory is consistent with price-setters' account of price rigidity as arising from the customer's---not the firm's---side, and their account of their reluctance to make the first step in changing prices. The kinked-demand theory can be tested against menu-cost models in micro data: it predicts that prices should be more likely to change if they have recently changed, and that prices should be more flexible in markets where customers can more easily compare prices. At the macro level, the kinked-demand theory induces a trade-off between output and inflation that substantially differs from prominent theories of sticky prices: the Phillips curve is strongly convex but does not contain any (present or past) expectations of inflation, and is non-vertical in the long-run."

Using a firm level and country representative survey, we construct country-time indicators of SMEs use of three external financing sources: bank loans, credit line/overdraft and trade credit. These indicators account for composition effects and demand effects. We find substantial differences between countries in the SMEs use of the three financing sources. In particular, the cross-country differences related to SMEs use of bank loans have significantly increased over the period 2010-2014. This divergence is not related to a global increase in the volatility of this use between countries. Instead, it has been driven by a sharper increase (resp decrease) in the countries where SMEs use was initially higher (resp. lower). Finally, we investigate whether SMEs uses of financing sources are correlated at the country level with various macroeconomic and banking structure indicators. The results suggest that indicators about banking concentration are good candidates to explain the cross-country divergence of SMEs use of bank loans."

This model predicts that employment growThéof firms facing positive productivity shocks shrinks with the level of the frictions.

Using a DSGE model calibrated for France within the euro area, we show that the increase in output resulting from tax cuts on capital income would indeed be higher than the increase in output resulting from tax cuts on labour, both in the short and long run. Importantly, the strong response of output to capital income tax cuts appears to be partly explained by the particularly high level of capital income taxes in France. Moreover, such tax cuts would be less efficient if they were expected to be only temporary. Finally, we illustrate our main points through a recent fiscal package implemented in France, which combines labour and capital income tax cuts. After briefly assessing this package, we find that investment and real output would have been more strongly boosted in the medium run if this package had been focused to a larger extent on reductions in capital income taxes."

Policy makers had to constantly adjust the policy mix as events unfolded. This meant implementing monetary and fiscal policy innovations, such as the suspension of the gold standard and the instauration of Britain's first income tax. These adjustments signalled the government's commitment to undertake the necessary to win the war, without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability. Drawing on new hand-collected data, we also show that the Bank of England played an essential role in two successive phases of the war. The Bank granted ample liquidity to the domestic payment system, by discounting large amounts of private bills. It also financed the decisive phase of the wars by purchasing large amounts of public debt. The successful winding down of the balance sheet and the resumption of the gold standard influenced the Bank's policies and shaped the political and financial landscape for the century to come."

We build a simple theoretical framework of firms investment with credit rationing and real estate collateral. We show that real estate prices affect firms borrowing capacities through two channels. An increase in real estate prices raises the value of the firms pledgeable assets and mitigates the agency problem characterizing the creditor-entrepreneur relationship. It simultaneously cuts the expected profit due to the increase in the cost of inputs. While the literature only focuses on the first channel, the identification of the second channel allows for heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on investment across firms. We test our theoretical predictions using a large French database. We do find heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on productive investment depending on the position of the firms in the sectoral distributions of real estate holdings. Our preferreDeestimates indicate that a 10% increase in real estate prices causes a 1% decrease in the investment rate of firms in the first decile of the distribution but a 6% increase in the investment rate of firms belonging to the last decile."

Model-Based Results,"625, Banque de France.","This paper focuses on growth enhancing budget-neutral fiscal reforms, i.e. changes in the composition of government revenues and spending that stimulate GDP growth while keeping the ratio of the fiscal budget to GDP constant. To this aim, we present simulation results using a multi-country DSGE model with three large economic regions, the US, the euro area and the rest of the world. The model features constrained and unconstrained non-Ricardian households and a detailed government sector; its multi-country nature allows investigating cross-country spillovers. The paper focuses on the most growth-friendly budget-neutral fiscal measures: (i) an incomplete fiscal devaluation (ii) a rise in government investment compensated by a fall in government consumption and (iii) a rise in government investment compensated by a rise in consumption and labor taxes. Dampening or amplifying effects due to coordination across policies (monetary and fiscal) and across economic regions are also considered. Three main results stand out. First, an increase in government investment financed by rising less distortionary taxes appears to be an effective growth-friendly budget-neutral reform in the sense that it generates both short- and long-run GDP growth and improves fiscal sustainability. Second, benefits and costs of budget-neutral reforms are not equally distributed across agents, giving rise to a policy trade-off between growth and distributional consequences. Third, budget-neutral reforms do not have large cross-border trade spillovers; however, reforms coordinated across all countries in periods of accommodative monetary policy do have amplified domestic effects."

Our main result, obtained from panel regressions with both state and time fixed effects, shows that highways and higher education spending growth in a given decade correlates negatively with Gini indices at the end of the decade. Such a finding suggests a causal effect from growth in infrastructure spending to a reduction in inequality, through better access to job and education opportunities. More significantly, this relationship is stronger with inequality at the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution. In addition, infrastructure expenditures on highways are shown to be more effective at reducing inequality. A counterfactual experiment reveals which US states ended up with a significantly higher bottom Gini coefficient in 2010 that is attributed to underinvestment in infrastructure over the first decade of the 21st century. From a policy making perspective, this paper aims to present innovations in finance for infrastructure investments, for the US, other industrially advanced countries and also for developing economies."

We use difference-in-differences panel regressions and emulate crises by studying how defaults of banks and non-agricultural firms were affected by the arrival of an agricultural disease. We exploit the specificities of the implementation of the discount window to deal with the endogeneity of the access to the central bank to the arrival of the crisis and local default rates. We find that broad eligibility reduced significantly the increase in the default rate when the shock hit the local economy. A counterfactual exercise shows that defaults would have been 10% to 15% higher if the Bank of France would have implemented the strictest eligibility rule. This effect is identified independently of changes in policy interest rates and the fiscal deficit.

This high uncertainty is reflected in the debate on the possibility of a secular stagnation , fuelled by the short-lived Information and Communication Technology (ICT) shock and the current low productivity and GDP growth in advanced countries. Our projection tool allows for the modelling of technology shocks, for different speeds of regulation and education convergence, with endogenous capital growth and TFP convergence processes. We illustrate the benefits of this tool through four growth scenarios, crossing the cases of a new technology shock or secular stagnation with those of regulation and education convergence or of absence of reforms. Over the 2015-2100 period, the secular stagnation scenario assumes yearly TFP growThéof 0.6% in the US, leading to a 1.5% GDP growth trend. The technology shock scenario assumes that the third technological revolution will, in the US, provide similar TFP gains to electricity during the second industrial revolution, leading to a 1.4% TFP trend, to which we add a TFP growth wave peaking in 2040, and thus to an average GDP growth rate of 3% in the US. In non-US countries, GDP growth will depend on the implementation of regulation reforms, the increase in education and on the distance to the country-specific convergence target, namely the US, as well. Over the period 2015-2060, for the euro area, Japan and the United Kingdom, benefits from regulation and education convergence would amount to a 0.1 to 0.4 pp yearly growth rate depending on the initial degree boThéof rigidity and the TFP distance to the US."

We show that a Kiyotaki-Moore model accounts for both properties when interest-rate movements are driven, in a significant way, by self-fulfilling shocks that redistribute income away from lenders and to borrowers during booms. The credit-based nature of such self-fulfilling equilibria is shown to be essential: the dynamic correlation between current loanable funds rate and future aggregate economic activity depends critically on the property that the interest rate is state-contingent. Bayesian estimation of our benchmark DSGE model on US data shows that the model driven by redistribution shocks results in a better fit to the data than both standard RBC models and Kiyotaki-Moore type models with unique equilibrium."

The projects funded by the loans are subject to persistent idiosyncratic shocks that are freely observed by the borrowers. Borrowers pay entry costs in order to produce and liquidation costs to exit and therefore are willing to pay a higher interest rate for greater security of funding. However, they also have limited liability and will make continuation choices that shift risk to the bank in the absence of monitoring. To limit its exposure to risk, the bank applies a continuation threshold of its own, labeled a covenant. The bank has an incentive to acquire information both to enforce the covenant in the current period and update its monitoring intensity in future periods. But information is costly to acquire and reduces the value of the loan contract to the borrower because it passes more of the continuation right to the bank and therefore lowers the equilibrium interest rate. The paper uses numerical methods to calculate the optimal monitoring rate and covenant threshold as well as the associated loan interest rate and default rate."

(1) Strategic interactions generate a time-varying desired markup; (2) endogenous entry and (3) heterogeneous productivity engender a self-selection of the most productive firms (which are also the largest ones) in international trade. Hence, the weight of large firms in domestic production increases in response to a fall in international trade costs. These large firms transmit less marginal cost fluctuations to price adjustments, rather absorbing them into their desired markup to protect their market share. At the aggregate level, this leads to domestic inflation reacting less to real activity fluctuations."

This paper tackles this issue through the estimation of a threshold vector autoregressive (TVAR) model on a sample of 19 commodity markets. We aim at (i) assessing whether the effect of macroeconomic uncertainty shocks on commodity price returns depends on the degree of uncertainty, and (ii) investigating the transfer from macroeconomic uncertainty to price uncertainty using a newly developed measure of commodity price uncertainty. Our findings show that both agricultural and industrial markets are highly sensitive to the variability and the level of macroeconomic uncertainty, while the impact on precious metals is more parsimonious given their well-identified safe-haven role in time of economic turmoil. In addition, we find evidence that the recent 2007-09 recession has generated an unprecedented episode of high uncertainty in numerous commodity prices. Interestingly, our analysis further reveals that volatility and uncertainty in prices can be disconnected. This is especially true for the oil market as most important shocks in the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s that lead to price volatility do not generate price uncertainty, highlighting the relevance of our uncertainty measure in linking uncertainty to predictability rather than to volatility."

We then tackle the endogenous location selection issue in two ways. First, we rely on a standard instrumental variable approach to deal with diversity at the local labor market level, and propose a new instrument: diversity in the public housing sector. After correcting for endogeneity, the positive effect of diversity at this level is driven down to zero, revealing that it was mostly due to self-selection. Second, regarding neighborhood diversity, we adopt the strategy developed by Bayer et al. (2008) which takes advantage of the very precise localization of the data. The negative effect of diversity on employment at the neighborhood level is reinforced. We also show that diversity in terms of nationalities (a proxy for cultural diversity) matters more than diversity based on parents' origins (a proxy for ethnic diversity).

Spill-overs beyond the manufacturing sector are an important issue given the large size of the non-traded sector in modern economies as well as the imperfect spatial mobility of households. In this paper, I estimate the impact of Chinese import competition onto the structure of employment and wages of local labor markets in France, with an emphasis on spill-overs effects beyond manufacturing and the degree of local wage inequality. Local employment and total labor income in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing are negatively affected by rising exposure to imports. The estimates imply that each local manufacturing job destroyed by Chinese import competition results in the loss of about 1.5 local job outside of manufacturing. These substantial local multiplier effects are however much lower when expressed in terms of hours worked or earnings rather than job count. Import competition from China polarized the local structure of employment in the manufacturing sector. The wage distribution is uniformly negatively affected in manufacturing while the non-traded sector experiences wage polarization, i.e. a rise in upper-tail inequality and a decline in bottom-tail inequality. While overall wage inequality is on average not affected, I show that it increased in response to trade shocks in areas where the minimum wage is only weakly binding."

We report that information captured by our model describes historical macroeconomic and liquidity events in the European banking system, and explains interest rate spreads after controlling for different measures commonly used to characterize money markets. In particular, an increase in 10% of the probability of migration from the Unsecured to Secured Market is associated to a 20% percent increase in the spread between Unsecured and Secured rates."

Our analysis is based on the variation across states and years and addresses the issue of endogeneity of immigrant flows using a set of instruments that leverage distance from country of origin and historical settlements of foreign-born to obtain a proxy for supply-driven immigration flows. Pooling all elections, immigration to the U.S. had a negative average impact on the vote share to the Republican Party. This is consistent with the typical view of political analysts in the U.S. However, this average effect mainly detectable in House elections has two components. When the growThéof the immigrant population is due to an increase in naturalized migrants, the effect on Republican vote is clearly negative. Yet, when the share of non-citizen migrants in the population increases and their share in the state population is large making immigration a salient policy issue the impact on the Republican vote share is positive. These results are consistent with stronger voting preferences of naturalized immigrants for the Democratic Party relative to native voters, but also with native voters' political preferences shifting towards the Republican Party in places with high immigration of non-citizens. In our estimates, the second effect is only significant when immigrants are a large portion of the local population."

In the case of regular publications, forecasters want to prevent such a persistence of errors over several periods. For this reason, a safeguard model can be used to inform the forecaster when there is a risk that the standard model (i.e. the best specified model on average) leads to persistent errors over several months or quarters. This paper explains why and how such a safeguard model has been built in order to improve the forecasts of French GDP at the current quarter horizon (nowcasts), which are officially published by the French central bank. The official benchmark model for GDP nowcasts is an aggregated model that relies exclusively on survey in the manufacturing industry. In the long run, this model still has the best performances. On the contrary, the safeguard model is a disaggregated model which features equations for the valued added of 6 sectors. From this example, we provide general remarks on the advantages of disaggregation as well as how such safeguard models can be used in practice."

We find two key results. First, in the case of an independent monetary policy, the adverse impact of limited credibility is relatively small, and consolidation can be expected to reduce government debt at a relatively low output cost given that monetary policy provides more accommodation than it would under perfect credibility. Second, the lack of monetary accommodation under currency union membership implies that the output cost may be significantly larger, and that progress in reducing government debt in the short and medium term may be limited under imperfect credibility."

When Sovereigns finance bailouts with newly issued debt and the price of Sovereign debt is sensitive to unanticipated debt issues, then bailouts dilute the value of banks' Sovereign debt holdings rendering bailouts less effective. We explore this feedback mechanism in a model of financial intermediation in which banks are subject to managerial moral hazard and ex ante optimality requires lenders to commit to ex post inefficient bank liquidations. A benevolent Sovereign may desire to enact bailouts to prevent such liquidations thereby neutralizing lenders' commitment. In this context, home bias for Sovereign debt may arise as a mechanism to deter bailouts and restore lenders' commitment."

Banks react issuing more interest-bearing deposits, but pay an interest rate that increases with the quantity being borrowed.

Using a 1890-2013 17-OECD country database, this paper improves the measurement of TFP by taking into account production factor quality, i.e. the education level of the working-age population for labor and the age of equipment for the capital stock. However, our main contribution is to assess the role of technology diffusion to TFP growth through two emblematic general purpose technologies, electricity and information and communication technologies (ICT). Using both growth decomposition methodology and instrumental variables estimates, this paper finds that, among factor quality, education levels have posted the largest contribution to growth, while the age of capital has a significant, although limited, contribution. Quality-adjusted production factors explain less than half of labor productivity growth in the largest countries but Japan, where capital deepening posted a very large contribution. As a consequence, the one big wave of productivity growth (Gordon, 1999), as well as the ICT productivity wave for the countries which experienced it, remains only partially explained by quality-adjusted factors, although education and technology diffusion contribute to explain the US earlier wave in the 1930s-1940s. Finally, technology diffusion, as captured through our two general purpose technologies, leaves between 0.6 and 1 point of yearly growth, as well as a large share of the two 20th century technology waves, unexplained. These results support both a significant lag in the diffusion of general purpose technologies and a wider view on growth factors, encompassing changes in the production process, management techniques or financing practices."

For the United States and Europe, we highlight that this slow pace began prior to the Great Recession. The timing thus suggests that it is important to consider factors other than just the deep crisis itself or policy changes since the crisis. For the United States, at the frontier of knowledge, there was a burst of innovation and reallocation related to the production and use of information technology in the second half of the 1990s and the early 2000s. That burst ran its course prior to the Great Recession. Continental European economies were falling back relative to that frontier at varying rates since the mid-1990s. We provide VAR and panel-data evidence that changes in real interest rates have nfluenced productivity dynamics in this period. In particular, the sharp decline in real interest rates that took place in Italy and Spain seem to have triggered unfavorable resource reallocations that were large enough to reduce the level of total factor productivity, consistent with recent theories and firm-level evidence."

This result holds true regardless of the nature of the recession: average firm-level productivity rises following a negative aggregate productivity shock, as well as following a negative financial shock.

However we depart from the standard methodology in two important ways: first, we correct China s capital stock for overinvestment by taking into account the credit cycle; second, we disentangle the effects of sectoral reallocations from within-sector productivity, allowing for a better assessment of the expected shift from manufacturing to services.

This result is robust to several checks, notably to the instrumentation of aid and to estimations on various sub-samples. We then provide evidence that the positive effect of aid is especially strong for firms operating in sectors that are intensive in infrastructure and external finance, suggesting that aid may improve firm performance through the alleviation of infrastructure and financing constraints in developing countries."

At a time when concerns about the sustainability of China s growth model are rising, this paper assesses to what extent a hard landing in China would impact other countries, with a focus on trade and commodity price channels. After reviewing the main arguments pointing to a hard landing scenario historical rebalancing precedents, overinvestment, unsustainable debt trends, and a growing real estate bubble we focus on a sample of thirty-six countries, and use a global VAR methodology adapted to conditional forecasting to simulate the impact of a Chinese hard landing. We model metal and oil markets separately to account for their different end-use patterns and consumption intensity in China, and we identify three specific transmission channels to net commodity exporters: through real exports, through income effects (related to commodity prices), and through investment (a fall in commodity prices reducing incentives to invest in the mining and energy sectors); we also look at the role played by the exchange rate as a shock absorber. According to our estimates, emerging economies (ex. China) would be hardest hit with a 7.5 percent cumulated growth loss after five years , in particular in South-East Asia but also in commodity-exporting regions such as Latin America; advanced economies would be less affected. The ""growth gap"" between emerging and advanced economies would be considerably reduced, leading to partial recoupling."

The dynamic nature of financial integration is first emphasized in order to account for both effects of risk sharing on the one hand and intermediation margins and bank rates of return on the other hand. In addition to considering simple variables of growth correlation, we exploit the multiple dimensions of business cycle synchronization first by allowing for asymmetric dynamics during expansion and recession, and by further acknowledging the importance of de-synchronized fluctuations to allow for the costs and benefits of financial integration for an individual country. Our main results are threefold. First, it seems that the financial integration variables are not informative about the likelihood of observing co-movements between the recession phases (after controlling for different variables influencing the business cycle). Secondly, our estimates portray a situation in which both risk-sharing and the convergence of price-based indicators lead to economic specialization rather than to a convergence of the expansion phases. Thirdly, the price-based indicators provide better information than risk-sharing variables to account for business cycle synchronization."

Combining two firm-level customs datasets for which we observe French and Chinese individual sales on the same destination market over the 2000-2006 period, we are able to estimate all the components of the dyadic elasticity: i) the demand-side parameter that governs the intensive margin and ii) the supply side parameters that drive the extensive margin. These components are then assembled under theoretical guidance to calculate bilateral aggregate elasticities over the whole set of destinations, and their decomposition into different margins. Our predictions fit well with econometric estimates, supporting our view that micro-data is a key element in the quantification of non-constant macro trade elasticities."

Two distinct instrumentation strategies suggest that this correlation (partly) reflects a causality from innovativeness to top income inequality, and the effect is significant: for example, when measured by the number of patent per capita, innovativeness accounts on average across US states for around 17% of the total increase in the top 1% income share between 1975 and 2010. Yet, innovation does not appear to increase other measures of inequality which do not focus on top incomes. Next, we show that the positive effects of innovation on the top 1% income share are dampened in states with higher lobbying intensity. Finally, from cross-section regressions performed at the commuting zone (CZ) level, we find that: (i) innovativeness is positively correlated with upward social mobility; (ii) the positive correlation between innovativeness and social mobility, is driven mainly by entrant innovators and less so by incumbent innovators, and it is dampened in states with higher lobbying intensity. Overall, our findings vindicate the Schumpeterian view whereby the rise in top income shares is partly related to innovation-led growth, where innovation itself fosters social mobility at the top through creative destruction."

I show that collateral policy can serve to dampen asymmetric shocks in a currency area when these shocks also affect the collateral held by banks and when collateral portfolios of banks differ systematically across countries. In my model banks from 2 countries use collateral to borrow from the money market or a central bank that targets a level of interest rate (or investment) in each economy. The distressed bank may enter a collateral crunch regime where it is constrained in its access to funding due to a moral hazard problem. The central bank faces an heterogeneous transmission of its interest rate: a unit change in rate has a smaller effect on the economy rate of the distressed country. The central bank therefore sets a high interest rate which is well transmitted in the booming economy and relaxes the haircut on the collateral owned by the distressed bank.

We present a simple model with Bayesian learning in which firms are uncertain about their idiosyncratic demand parameter in each of the markets they serve, and update their beliefs as noisy information arrives in each period. The model predicts that firms update more their beliefs following a new demand shock, the younger they are. To test this learning mechanism, we make use of a specific feature of exporter-level data which contains both the values and the quantities sold by a given firm for the same product in different destination markets. This allows us to derive a methodology that identifies separately the demand shocks faced by the firms and their beliefs about future demand. We find strong support for our main prediction: the updating process appears especially strong in the first years after entry. However, the bulk of accumulated knowledge is lost during short periods of exit. Second, we consider implications of this prediction for firm growth rates and survival. Consistent with the learning model, we find that: (i) the absolute value of the mean growth rate for firms' beliefs decreases with age, as does the variance within cohorts; (ii) exit probability decreases with firms' beliefs and the demand shock the firm faces. Further, demand shocks trigger more exit in younger cohorts."

I extend the standard empirical approach in two main ways. First, I apply a micro-founded strategy for disentangling demand from supply shifts in credit. Using this identification scheme, I show that lending supply is negatively correlated with the short-term market interest rate over the long period. The sensitivity of credit supply to monetary shocks is not related to the bank characteristics generally used in the empirical literature, whereas a proxy of the individual bank external finance premium (EFP) tends to capture financial constraints better than size, liquid assets or capitalization ratios. However, the patterns of the BLC have changed since the onset of the global financial crisis. In the post-crisis period, the money market rate does not affect the lending supply of the average bank anymore, while small banks and those lacking access to long-term funds appear more sensitive to monetary shocks in some estimations. Second, I check whether several types of uncertainty may drive the BLC, beyond liquidity risk. Over the long period, I find evidence that higher market risk borne by banks' securities portfolios (captured by a longer duration of public debt bonds) and lower uncertainty in the money market (captured by a lower volatility of rates) appear to consistently enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy through the BLC."

We measure banks marginal cost by their rate on new deposits, contrary to the literature that focuses on money market rates. This allows us to account for banks risks. We focus on the interest rate on new short-term loans granted to non-financial corporations in these countries. Our analysis is based on an error-correction approach that we extend to handle the time-varying long-run relationship between banks lending rates and banks marginal cost, as well as stochastic volatility. Our empirical results are based on a harmonised monthly database from January 2003 to October 2014. We estimate the model within a Bayesian framework, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC).We reject the view that the transmission mechanism is time invariant. The long-run relationship moved with the sovereign debt crises to a new one, with a slower pass-through and higher bank lending rates. Its developments are heterogeneous from one country to the other. Impediments to the transmission of monetary rates depend on the heterogeneity in banks marginal costs and therefore, its risks. We also find that rates to small firms increase compared to large firms in a few countries. Using a VAR model, we show that overall, the effect of a shock on the rate of new deposits on the unexpected variances of new loans has been less important since 2010. These results confirm the slowdown in the transmission mechanism."

We calibrate the model to firm-level balance sheet data for Greece and quantify the response of tax evasion to the 2010 fiscal adjustment. One third of the tax increase is lost because small and medium size firms expand their share of non-declared activity.

If fixed costs are at the firm level, multi-product firms have a cost advantage and dominate international trade. If fixed costs are at the product level, many firms export different varieties of the same product. Using detailed product level data from 40 exporting countries to 180 destination markets, the results indicate that entry barriers operate at the product level. Looking at firm entry within products across time and destinations, I find evidence of spillover effects that reduce fixed costs for product market rivals, increase firm en- try and augment export revenues. The efficiency gains in production through lower product fixed costs outweigh the competition effects from more firm entry. Trade policies encouraging product entry, such as advertising products in destination markets through export promotion agencies, would result in more firm entry and generate higher export revenues."

Based on these facts, I assess the ability of the Eaton-Kortum model, the workhorse model of modern Ricardian trade theory, to account for the observed patterns. The results show that specialization through comparative advantage induced by technological differences can explain the qualitative and quantitative facts.

In order to do so, I add three ingredients to an otherwise standard two-country new-Keynesian model: strategic interactions generate time varying desired markup; endogenous firm entry makes the market structure change with globalization; heterogeneous productivity allows for self-selection among firms. Because of productivity heterogeneity, only high-productivity firms (that are also the bigger ones) enter the export market. They tend to transmit less marginal cost fluctuations into inflation because they absorb them into their desired markup in order to protect their market share. At the aggregate level, the increase in the proportion of large firms reduces the pass-through of marginal cost into inflation."

As the composition of growth matters at least as much as its overall intensity, it is key to identify the sectors that have the strongest impact on poverty reduction and unleash their potential; if growth happens to concentrate in sectors with scarce pro-poor potential, like commodity-driven growth, redistributive strategies are necessary to compensate the weak effect on poverty."

This fact tends to prevent less financially sophisticated customers from asking advice although they are the most in need of financial guidance. Overall, the model predicts a monotonic relationship between financial literacy and the demand for financial advice. I then use a representative sample of French households (PATER 2011) to test the predictions of the model. I find that financial literacy is strongly associated to the probability to ask a financial advisor. Decomposing the measure of financial literacy, I show that the relationship is weakly monotonic which provides support to the fact that financial advice cannot substitute for financial literacy.

Such a change is consequential: banks with higher centrality within the network have better access to liquidity and are able to charge larger intermediation spreads. Therefore, we show the existence of a sizeable interbank lending channel."

To explore the relationship between these variables, we develop a macroeconomic model with firms that are subject to both credit and labor market frictions. The value of collateral is driven by the forward-looking dynamics of the land price which reacts endogenously to fundamental and non-fundamental (sunspot) shocks. We calibrate the model to French data and find that land price shocks give rise to significant amplification and hump-shaped responses of investment, vacancies and unemployment that are in line with the data. We show that both the endogenous movements in the firms discount factor and the sluggish response of the land price are key elements that drive the results."

Fragmentation is defined as the situation where some banks are cut from the interbank loan market. The paper incorporates fragmentation in an otherwise standard theoretical model of monetary policy implementation, where profit maximizing banks, subject to reserve requirements, borrow and deposit funds at a central bank. It shows that in the presence of fragmentation, excess liquidity arises endogenously and the interbank rate declines below the central bank main rate. The interbank rate is then unstable. The paper documents that this is what happened in the Euro-Area since 2008. The model is also well suited to analyze unconventional monetary policy measures."

We then show that the microeconomic dynamics of former colonies exports and imports at the product level is significantly influenced by the geographical proximity between trade partners and the former colonizer, or their degree of economic integration. These results are consistent with the predictions from models of trade networks (Chaney2014). Overall, they confirm that the microeconomic dynamics of trade contribute to shape the cross-sectional distribution of aggregate trade flows across countries."

These new facts present a challenge to benchmark models of expectation formation based on informational frictions. We show that these models require two additional ingredients to match the entire term structure of disagreement: First, agents must disentangle low-frequency shifts in the fundamentals of the economy from short-term fluctuations. Second, agents must take into account the dynamic interactions between variables when forming forecasts. While models enriched with these features capture the observed term structure of disagreement irrespective of the source of the informational friction, they fall short at explaining the time-variance of disagreement at medium- and long-term horizons. We also use the term structure of disagreement to analyze the monetary policy rule perceived by professional forecasters and show that it features a high degree of interest-rate smoothing and time variation in the intercept."

In this respect, the Mixed-Data Sampling (MIDAS) model has proved to outperform existing tools by combining data series of different frequencies. However, major issues remain regarding the choice of explanatory variables. The paper first addresses this point by developing MIDAS based dimension reduction techniques and by introducing two novel approaches based on either a method of penalized variable selection or Bayesian stochastic search variable selection. These features integrate a cross-validation procedure that allows automatic in-sample selection based on recent forecasting performances. Then the developed techniques are assessed with regards to their forecasting power of US economic growth during the period 2000-2013 using jointly daily and monthly data.

It examines how a monopoly bank sets its monitoring intensity in order to manage credit risk when it makes long duration loans to borrowers who have private knowledge of their project's stochastic profitability. In contrast to standard models, it has a recursive structure and a general equilibrium. The bank loan contract considered specifies the interest rate, the monitoring intensity and a profitability covenant. Within this class of contract, the bank chooses the terms which maximise steady-state profits subject to the constraint that it must have as many deposits as loans. The model is then used to consider whether the reduction in credit standards and credit spreads observed before the financial crisis could have been caused by low official interest rates or a positive deposit shock. The model rejects a risk-taking channel of monetary policy and endorses the savings glut hypothesis."

I claim that a New Keynesian model with nominal rigidities is able to replicate the set of moments of both volatilities and correlations; the model presents two distinctive features: employment decreases after a positive technological shock and the calibration strategy in choosing the vacancy posting cost is different with respect of Shimer (2005) and in line with the RBC tradition.

In this paper we look at a well-documented solution to this problem, and a key institution of the commodity money system: coin assaying. To that goal we build a model of search and matching in which agents trade using coins that are imperfectly recognizable, but have access to a coin inspection technology that reveals the intrinsic content of coins for a fee. We consider two sources of imperfect information: counterfeit coins and clipping. With counterfeits we show that coin assaying reduced the extent of inefficiencies associated with imperfect coins recognizability (namely lower traded quantities and lower trading frequencies). Yet it did not necessarily increase welfare because it unmasked counterfeits which then traded at a discount, reducing total output. With clipping, we show that agents clip for two reasons: in the hope of passing an inferior coin for a superior one, and to reduce the purchasing power of coins that are too valuable. While coin assaying could remove the first type of clipping, it had no effect on the second. While framed in the context of the commodity money system, our analysis relates to the more general issue of asset trading under imperfect information."

We find that our results are mainly driven by observations on euro area countries after the onset of the 2008 crisis, wiThéobserved spreads found to significantly exceeDeestimated values during the crisis for a number of euro area countries. We also shed light on the effect of unconventional monetary policies, while Target 2 balances are used for euro area countries in order to reflect concerns on the stability of the euro area. Finally, according to our cointegration model, we find a long-term relationship between the spread, the debt-to-GDP ratio, and potential GDP growth, with a larger impact of the latter variable."

 """,2014.,"Heterogeneity, Unemployment Benefits and Voluntary Labor Force Participation","493, Banque de France.","In this paper, I propose a new Keynesian DSGE model with labor market search and matching frictions which replicates the low volatility and the moderate procyclicality of the labor force participation rate, that are observed in the United States at business cycle frequency. That being so,it can also generate large procyclical fluctuations in the vacancy-unemployment ratio. This results from two plausible explanations, namely heterogeneity in households preferences and unemployment benefits. Aggregate movements in the participation rate are also consistent with rational behavior of individual agents. In particular, heterogeneous workers cannot share perfectly their idiosyncratic risk and adopt a consumption allocation arrangement which motivates their participation in the labor market. As a result, both labor force participation and job acceptance are voluntary."

This exercise was announced in October 2011 and required large European banking groups to meet a higher Tier 1 capital ratio by June 2012, after accounting for an unprecedented temporary buffer against exposure to sovereign debt. Controlling for bank characteristics and demand at the level of country of residence, we find that banks in a banking group that had to increase its capital by 1 percent of risk-weighted assets tended to have annualized loan growth (over the 9 month period of the exercise) that was between 1.2 and 1.6 percentage points lower than for banks in groups that did not have to increase their capital ratio. Looking at aggregate effects at the country level, we also find that banks that did not have to recapitalize did not substitute for more constrained lenders.

The simultaneous estimation of common factors (shared by all countries) and local factors (specific to one country) requires development of a normalization procedure beyond that of ordinary factor analysis. By jointly estimating common and local factors we avoid sequential estimation effects that may explain the lack of agreement in the multi-country term structure literature regarding not only the total number of latent factors required to explain the joint dynamics of yield curves, but also the number of common and of local factors. Using data on international yield curves of U.S., Germany, U.K. and Japan from January 1986 to December 2009, we generally find (analyzing yields in level and in difference) that a model with two common factors and three correlated local factors is preferred to a model (of similar complexity) that includes one common factor only or a model wiThéonly correlated local factors. In addition, each common factor closely mimics (or is similar to) a local factor extracted from a pure local factor model. We also reach the conclusion that dependence across international yield curves are driven, first, by the instantaneous correlation between local factors of different countries and, then, by the (full) autoregressive matrix of latent factors and by the matrix of common loadings."

In a first step, we show that the main domestic determinants of FDI inflows are the market size, risk premia, unit labour costs, the openness, as well as progress in structural reforms (mainly related to privatisation process and banking sector) and institutional reforms (namely the lack of trade barriers, the ability for individuals to accumulate private property and progress in fighting corruption) in the host economy. Moreover, the macroeconomic conditions in the euro area also play an important role in explaining FDI flows to the region. In a second step, we analyse the impact of FDI inflows on economic growth.

We consider the occurrence of the 2007 and 2011 crises and show their negative impact on the FDI - economic growth link, both crises reducing the positive impact of FDI on economic growth."

We extend existing structural forMêmethodologies by considering the effect of both taxes and transfers. Non-labour income contains the (hypothetical) transfer amount someone gets when out of work, while the wage is replaced by the difference between net wages and the amount of lost transfers due to taking up a job (gains to work). To incorporate these components of the budget set, we employ a detailed tax-benefit model. Using data from the Hungarian Household Budget Survey (HKF), we find that participation probabilities are strongly influenced by transfers and the gains to work, particularly for low-skill groups and the elderly. Moreover, the same change in the net wage leads to a much larger change in the gains to work for low earners, making them even more responsive to wages and taxation. Overall, we find that a single equation can capture a large heterogeneity of individual responsiveness to taxes and transfers. Our parametric estimates can be readily utilized in welfare evaluations, or microsimulation analyses of tax and transfer reforms."

We find that a higher capital ratio is associated with higher growThéof lending abroad when aggregate liquidity conditions deteriorate. We find that our results are mainly driven by cross-border lending to the financial sector whereas local lending by foreign affiliates is hardly affected by the balance sheet shocks that the overall banking group is experiencing. We also investigate to what extent the identified effects differ depending on whether banks accessed public liquidity during the crisis and find that our baseline results are sensitive to the inclusion of central bank liquidity assistance."

Factor utilisation adjusts the most rapidly, first through capital capacity utilisation and the capital workweek and then labour working time. The adjustment is slow for the number of employees and even slower for the capital stock. In case of a change in factor volume targets, the three factor utilisation degrees adjust to offset the very slow reaction of factor volumes. Obstacles to increasing the capital operating time lead to a slower adjustment of capital operating time, offset by a stronger adjustment of capacity utilisation."

The key feature of the framework is to endogenize the network of exposures, the gross and net notional amounts traded and the collateral delivered through initial and variation margins, as a function of idiosyncratic counterparty risk and regulatory collateral and clearing requirements. Using the framework, we investigate numerically the size of the derivatives network, the aggregate collateral demand and the pricing of the contracts under the following schemes: (i) various levels of collateralization for uncleared transactions, (ii) rehypothecation of received collateral and (iii) clearing through a central clearing party (CCP). Overall results suggest that dynamic effects due to the endogeneity of the derivative network to the collateralization and clearing requirements have sizeable consequences on both contract volumes and prices. Intermediary trading and market liquidity are reduced by higher collateralization requirements and enhanced by rehypothecation, while the potential for contagion is reduced. Not accounting for dynamic effects in current market conditions may lead to over-estimate collateral demand induced by mandatory central clearing by up to 22%."

These are the average spreads on the yield of euro area private sector bonds relative to the yield on German federal government securities of matched maturities. The indicators are also constructed at the country level for Germany, France, Italy and Spain. These indicators reveal that the financial crisis of 2008 has dramatically increased the cost of market funding for both banks and non-financial firms. In contrast, the prior recession following the 2000 U.S. dot-com bust led to widening credit spreads of non-financial firms but had no effect on the credit spreads of financial firms. The 2008 financial crisis also led to a systematic divergence in credit spreads for financial firms across national boundaries. This divergence in cross-country credit risk increased further as the European debt crisis has unfolded since 2010. Since that time, credit spreads for both non-financial and financial firms increasingly reflect national rather than euro area financial conditions. Consistent with this view, credit spreads provide substantial predictive content for a variety of real activity and lending measures for the euro area as a whole and for individual countries. VAR analysis implies that disruptions in corporate credit markets lead to sizeable contractions in output, increases in unemployment, and declines in inflation across the euro area."

We use a unique database for the French banking sector between 2003 and 2011 combining confidential bank-level Bank Lending Survey answers with the discretionary capital requirements set by the supervisory authority. We find that on average, more capital means an acceleration of credit. But the elasticity of lending to capital depends on the intensity of the supervisory capital constraint. More supervisory capital-constrained banks tend to have a credit growth that is less sensitive to the capital ratio. Our results also show a similar effect for non-performing loans. When banks are constrained, credit growth is all the more sensitive to this type of assets as their share rises. However, both aforementioned effects weaken close to the supervisory minimum capital requirement."

Using a cross section of detailed monthly firm-product-destination level French export data we show that, in line with the predictions of the model, firms adjust on both margins for market size. In a stochastic setting, increased demand uncertainty is associated with larger logistics costs as well as a more convex marginal cost function. Firms adjust to increased uncertainty by reducing their sales and, for a given export volume, by reducing their number of shipments and increasing their shipment size. We show that these predictions of the model are in line with patterns in the data."

We show that if the energy-saving technical progress rate remains at its recent historical value, the magnitude of the carbon tax is quite unrealistic. When the direction of technical progress responds endogenously to economic incentives, CO2 emissions can be reduced by more than that allowed by the substitution possibilities, but not by a factor of four. To achieve this, an additional instrument is needed, namely a subsidy to fossil energy-saving research. The redirection of technical progress, which is a driver of energy transition, comes at a small cost in terms of the overall growth rate of the economy."

The first big wave was staggered across countries, hitting the US first in the Interwar years and the rest of the world after World War II. It came long after the actual innovation could be implemented, emphasizing a long diffusion process. The productivity leader changed during the period under study, the Australian and UK leadership becoming a US one during the first part of the XXth century and, for very particular reasons, also a Norwegian, Dutch and French one at least for some years at the end of the XXth century. The convergence process has been erratic, halted by inappropriate institutions, technology shocks, financial crises but above all by wars, which led to major productivity level leaps, downwards for countries experiencing war on their soil, upwards for other countries. Productivity trend breaks are detected following wars, global financial crises, global supply shocks (such as the oil price shocks) and major policy changes (such as structural reforms in Canada or Sweden). The upward trend break for the US in the mid-1990s is confirmed, as well as the downward trend break for the Euro Area in the same period.

This paper uses quarterly data, covering all exchanges flows at the product level since 2005, to compute indicators of export performance stripped of compositional effects. The resulting Export Competitiveness Database (ECD) reveals that emerging and developing regions, particularly the Asia and Pacific one, had strongest capacity to gain market shares in the most recent period, with changes reflecting growth in export volumes rather than price developments (once controlled for the composition effects). In contrast, ECD indicators also trace the legacy of the double-dip recession in the euro area, which have turned into negative the geographical effects of the traditional intra-zone specialization, despite the generally positive effects of sectoral structure. These measures of competitiveness correlate to nominal and real effective exchange rates, factors that are commonly perceived as important determinants of a country s export competitiveness."

In this study, we focus on government expenditures on goods and services. Our conclusion following Blanchard and Perotti (2002) for the identification of government spending shocks is that the multiplier is significant and not far from 1 on impact and becomes statistically insignificant after about 3 years in France. We provide numerous robustness checks concerning the definition of expenditures, assumptions about data stationarity, the role of expectations and the choice of the sample. Moreover, using a time-varying SVAR model, our main findings are (1) that the multiplier did not evolve significantly at any horizon since the beginning of the 1980s and (2) that the variance of shocks hitting the economy evolves a lot more than the model autoregressive parameters. Even in alternative specifications where the Bayesian priors are pushed towards time-variation, the main evolution that we uncover is a (non-significant) decrease of the medium term expenditure multiplier, partly linked to a more aggressive monetary policy since the 1990s. We do not find evidence of an increase of the multiplier during every recession in France, contrary to the finding of Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) for the United States.

(b) Second banks specialising on contracts that do not include monitoring feature less cyclical fluctuations of aggregate lending. This has clear implications: (i) the presence of banking heterogeneity decreases firms average productivity as it increases adverse selection by entrepreneurs as well as favours rent extractions by banks; (ii) an individual bank featuring a lower cyclicality signals a lower efficiency in its monitoring abilities; (iii) a heterogeneous banking system featuring a lower cyclicality of aggregate lending might not be desirable as it may come along with allocative and incentives distortions.

Therefore, identifying the impact of the 2008 crisis requires to distinguish, among the failures occurring over the period, those resulting from the crisis from hose mechanically stemming from firm demography, as we know that many firms disappear during their first years of existence. Our study was conducted using the universe of firms created between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2007. This sample is extracted from the database managed by the Companies Direction at Banque de France. The lack of complete information on firms created before 2000 led us to restrict the sample to newly created firms, but the period under study is long enough to encompass the increase in the number of firm creation in 2003-2004. The originality of this study lies both in the sample size and in the richness of the data used. Our statistical analysis focuses on the period between the date of the firm creation and of its first failure. The impact of the crisis is estimated using a flexible duration model, stratified according to the date of creation. The model takes into account the effects of the company age at the failure date, its industry, its size and the sequence of dates associated with its payment incidents on trade bills. We examine more specifically the failure rates in four industries: retail trade, transport, manufacturing and construction. The proportion of failures due to the crisis varies greatly across these four sectors. On average, the impact of the 2008 crisis has been of 27% in retail trade, 35% in transports, 43 % in manufacturing and 46 % in construction. Younger firms, namely those created in 2006 and 2007, were the most affected by the crisis."

Unlike the results on spot rates in the empirical financial literature, we find that bank interest rates do not display evidence of mean reversion, and that the variance increases with the level of the bank rates only for a few countries. Moreover, we notice that the correlations between changes in the rates are not constant over the whole time period, and peak during the last months of 2008. Afterwards, they return more or less quickly to their previous level for some countries, while they remain lower for others.

We also implement double difference estimations, using the fact that targeted urban areas have been selected in different waves over time. Finally, we exploit a discontinuity in the eligibility criteria of the policy as an exogenous source of variation to estimate the impact of the treatment. We find that conditioning on locating in a municipality that hosts a ZFU, the policy has a positive and sizable impact on the probability to locate in the ZFU part rather than in the non-ZFU part of municipalities. However the impact is highly heterogeneous across zones, industries and firms. Moreover, we show that the policy mostly generates diversion effects within municipalities."

Using a dynamic loan market competition model where borrowers face both exogenous and endogenous costs to switch between banks, we uncover a competition softening effect of securitization that allows banks to extract rents in the primary loan market. By reducing monitoring incentives, securitization mitigates winner s curse effects in future stages of competition thereby decreasing ex ante competition for initial market share. Due to this competition softening effect, securitization can adversely affect loan market efficiency while leading to higher equilibrium profits for banks. This effect is driven by primary loan market competition, not by the exploitation of informational asymmetries in the secondary market for loans. We also argue that banks can use securitization as a strategic response to an increase in competition, as a tool to signal a reduction in monitoring intensity for the sole purpose of softening ex ante competition. Our result suggests that securitization reforms focusing exclusively on informational asymmetries in markets for securitized products may overlook competitive conditions in the primary market."

The default indicator is replaced by an appropriate prediction and the prediction error, that is the default-event surprise, is neglected. Our paper develops an approach to get closed-form expressions for the prices of credit derivatives written on multiple names without neglecting default-event surprises. This approach differs from the standard one, since the default counts necessarily cause the factor process under the risk-neutral probability, even if this is not the case under the historical probability. This implies that the standard exponential pricing formula of default does not apply. Using U.S. bond data, we show that allowing for the pricing of default events has important implications in terms of both data-fitting and model-implied physical probabilities of default. In particular, it may provide a solution to the credit spread puzzle. Besides, we show how our approach can be used to account for the propagation of defaults on the prices of credit derivatives."

However, recent studies on international migration have overlooked the role of short-run factors in explaining international migration flows. This paper aims to fill that gap. We first derive a model of optimal migration choice based on an extension of the traditional Random Utility Model. Our model predicts that an improvement in the economic activity in a potential destination country relative to any origin country may trigger some additional migration flows on top of the impact exerted by long-run factors such as the wage differential or the bilateral distance. Compiling a dataset with annual gross migration flows between 30 developed origin and destination countries over the 1980-2010 period, we empirically test the magnitude of the effect of short-run factors on bilateral flows. Our econometric results indicate that relative aggregate fluctuations and employment rates affect the intensity of bilateral migration flows.

It is argued that foreign reserve accumulation is part and parcel of a growth strategy based on strong capital investment in a financially constrained economy. It is further proved using a Ramsey problem that purchasing international reserves is a welfare-improving policy in terms of production efficiency gains if it is jointly used with capital controls. In fact, when domestic firms are occasionally credit-constrained and they do not have a direct access to international financial market, they need domestic saving instruments to increase their retained earnings so that they can sufficiently invest in capital. The central bank plays the role of financial intermediary and provides domestic firms with liquid public bonds, thus relaxing domestic financial constraints. The proceeds of domestic public bonds are invested abroad due to the limited scope of domestic financial market and a depressed domestic interest rate, leading to foreign reserve stockpiling. The speed of foreign reserve accumulation would slow down once the economic growth rate decelerates and the domestic financial market develops."

When agents update their beliefs about the unobserved process driving financial shocks to the leverage ratio, the responses of output and other aggregates under adaptive learning are significantly larger than under rational expectations. In our benchmark case calibrated using US data on leverage, debt-to-GDP and land value-to-GDP ratios for 1996Q1-2008Q4, learning amplifies leverage shocks by a factor of about three, relative to rational expectations. When fed with the actual leverage innovations, the learning model predicts the correct magnitude for the Great Recession, while its rational expectations counterpart predicts a counter-factual expansion. In addition, we show that procyclical leverage reinforces the impact of learning and, accordingly, that macro-prudential policies enforcing countercyclical leverage dampen the effects of leverage shocks. Finally, we illustrate how learning with a misspecified model that ignores real/financial linkages also contributes to magnify financial shocks."

The spillover effect of policy uncertainty on capital flows depends on the time period as well as on global and domestic economic conditions. After the financial crisis more of the effect of policy uncertainty on capital flows was transmitted via overall financial market uncertainty than previously. We also find evidence for a structural break in the direction and explanatory power of portfolio flow determinants including policy uncertainty in Q2 2007 at the onset of the financial crisis, and again in Q4 2010.

The second one is based on econometric estimations of the probability and the cost of a systemic banking crisis. The former approach provides an upper evaluation of the fiscal cost of systemic banking crises, whereas the latter one provides a lower one. Hence we believe that the combined use of these two methodologies helps to gauge the range of fiscal risk."

Through the use of stock market data and Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads, this paper examines the investors reaction to Lehman s collapse in an attempt to identify a spillover effect on the surviving financial institutions. The empirical analysis indicates that (i) the collateral damages were limited to the largest financial firms; (ii) the most affected institutions were the surviving non-bank financial services firms; (iii) the negative effect was correlated with financial conditions of the surviving institutions. We also detect significant abnormal jumps in the CDS spreads that we interpret as evidence of sudden upward revisions in the market assessment of future default probabilities assigned to the surviving financial firms."

One of the main advantages of our framework, particularly relevant as regards the calibration of transitory shocks, is that it allows considering various reverting patterns for the stressed variables and informs the choice of the appropriate stress horizon. We illustrate the proposed methodology by implementing outlier detection algorithms to several time series of (macro)economic and financial variables typically used in bank stress testing."

We compute country-specific indices which measure the volatility of the international price of 41 commodities in the sectors of agriculture, minerals and energy. We find robust evidence that tax revenues in developing countries are hurt by the volatility of commodity prices. More specifically, the volatility of import prices decreases revenues from international trade tax while the volatility of export prices reduces revenues from income tax. We also show that this negative effect on tax revenues is not homogenous between countries. First, the export price volatility impact is negative except for oil exporters for whom it is null. Second, the magnitude of the negative impact of import price volatility on tax revenues depends on the tariff structure, i.e. is greater in countries where tariff dispersion is high."

The key point is that we do not do not impose the dependence structure but let the data select it. To do so, we model the dependence between commodity (metal, agriculture and energy) and stock markets using a flexible approach that allows us to investigate whether the co-movement is : (i) symmetric and occurring most of the time, (ii) symmetric and occurring mostly during extreme events and (iii) asymmetric and occurring mostly during extreme events. We also allow for this dependence to be time-varying from January 1990 to February 2012. Our analysis uncovers three major stylized facts. First, we find that the dependence between commodity and stock markets is time varying, symmetric and occurs most of the time (as opposed to mostly in extreme events). Second, not allowing for time-varying parameters in the dependence distribution generates a bias toward evidence of tail dependence. Similarly, considering only tail dependence may lead to wrong evidence of asymmetry. Third, a growing comovement between industrial metals and equity markets is identified as early as in 2003, a comovement that spreads to all commodity classes and becomes unambiguously stronger with the global financial crisis after Fall 2008."

It has also triggered renewed interest in the literature on currency crises, with many countries, especially among emerging market economies, experiencing severe exchange market pressure. While several policy institutions are in the process of developing new early warning systems, there is a lot of skepticism on the ability to predict currency crises or, more generally, any type of financial crises. This skepticism stems from the alleged poor out-of-sample performance of leading models, but also from a more fundamental objection, according to which it is by definition impossible to predict crises what can be referred to as a new impossibility theorem . Moreover, another criticism of early warning systems is that they may contribute to the phenomenon they are supposed to fight (the self-fulfilling prophecies view). The objective of this paper is to challenge this skeptical view. To this aim, the paper discusses the general conditions under which the impossibility theorem may fail and self-fulfilling prophecies can be avoided, stemming e.g. from political economy arguments. The ability of a simple currency crisis model to provide useful information on economic vulnerabilities is illustrated by testing its out-of-sample performance in a panel of emerging market economies following the collapse of Lehman Brothers."

The source of financial fragility is the socially excessive risk-taking by banks due to limited liability and deposit insurance. We characterize the conditions under which locally optimal (Ramsey) policy dedicates the prudential instrument to preventing inefficient risk-taking by banks; and the monetary instrument to dealing with the business cycle, with the two instruments co-varying negatively.

Entrepreneurs receive private signals about the productivity of the new technology and borrow from households to publicly invest in the old or the new technology. The three main results of the paper are that bubbles (informational cascades) can occur in this general equilibrium setting; that the central bank can detect them even though it has directly access to less information than the investors; and that the central bank can eliminate bubbles by manipulating the interest rate. Indeed, monetary policy, by affecting the investors' cost of resources, can make them invest in the new technology if and only if they receive an encouraging private signal about its productivity. In doing so, it makes their investment decision reveal their private signal, and therefore prevents herd behavior and the asset-price bubble. We also show that such a leaning against the wind"" monetary policy, contingent on the central bank's information set, may be preferable to laisser-faire, in terms of ex ante welfare."

I find that (i) public bank lending is significantly less cyclical than that of private banks, (ii) public banks cut less on their loans during economic downturns, with a positive relation between economic development and their ability to absorb macro shocks, and (iii) privatised banks switch from a regime of low to high lending cyclicality. Then, the lower co-movement of public bank loans with macroeconomic fluctuations reveals both (a) a less vulnerable balance sheet structure and more stable financing sources, which is consistent with a lending relationship business model, (b) as well as delayed loan deterioration, which is a symptom of forbearance and inefficient loan management; the actual combination of the two is not orthogonal to economic development, with high income countries more likely to feature efficient public bank lending cyclicality, while evidences suggest it may reveal an inefficient credit allocation for less developed countries."

Previous studies have looked at the role of backward linkages with domestic suppliers and their effects on domestic competitors. In this paper, we study how these externalities are affected by technological incompatibilities between foreign and domestic technologies. When foreign technologies require specialized inputs, some local suppliers self-select into production for multinational firms. A decrease in the cost of inputs compatible with the foreign technology has heterogeneous effects. It benefits foreign firms and the most productive downstream domestic firms that adopt the foreign technology, and negatively affects firms using the domestic technology. Technological incompatibilities reduce the welfare gains from openness to FDI, but this negative effect can be overcome by domestic technology adoption. The model's predictions are consistent with the stylized facts drawn from the empirical literature on FDI spillovers."

We examine the optimal policy of the central bank by modelling it as a Ramsey planner who can choose the level of domestic public debt and of international reserves. The central bank can improve the saving opportunities of credit-constrained consumers modelled as in Woodford (1990). We find that in a steady state it is optimal for the central bank to replicate the open economy, i.e., to issue debt financed by the accumulation of reserves so that the domestic interest rate equals the foreign rate. When the economy is in transition, however, a rapidly growing economy has a higher welfare without capital mobility and the optimal interest rate differs from the international rate. In the chinese context, we argue that the domestic interest rate should be temporarily above the international rate, which means that the central bank should accumulate more foreign assets than in an open economy."

The random allocation of the households over file managers with different pro-household friendlinesses is used to correct for endogeneity. Sixty percent of households are ordered to repay part of their debt. Over a two-year horizon, the possibility to grant a delay of payment decreases the average redefault rate and the average repayment rate respectively from 13 to 7 percentage points and from 14 to 12 percentage points. The net benefit over a small fraction of low distressed households offsets the loss observed over a large fraction of more distressed households.

Preliminary evidence shows that large banks borrow on average at better rates compared to smaller institutions, both before and after the start of the financial crisis. Nonetheless, controlling for size, centrality measures can capture part of the cross-sectional variation in overnight rates. More specifically: (1) Before the start of the crisis all the banks, independently of their size, profit from different forms of interconnectedness, but the economic size of the effect is small. Bank reputation and perceived credit riskiness are the most relevant factors to reduce average daily interest rates. Foreign banks borrow at a discount over Italian ones. (2) After August 2007 the impact of banks interconnectedness becomes larger but changes sign: the reward stemming from a higher centrality becomes a punishment , which possibly reflects market discipline. Bank reputation becomes even more important. (3) After Lehman s bankruptcy the effect of centrality on the spread maintains the same sign as after August 2007, but the magnitude increases remarkably.

This goal is achieved by introducing the notion of Exponential-Quadratic SDF or, equivalently, the notion of Second-Order Esscher Transform. The log-pricing kernel is specified as a quadratic function of the factor and the associated sources of risk are priced by means of possibly non-linear stochastic first-order and second-order risk-correction coefficients. Focusing on security market models, this approach is developed in the multivariate conditionally Gaussian framework and its usefulness is testified by the specification and calibration of what we name the Second-Order GARCH Option Pricing Model.

Next, the paper turns to higher frequency data for a subset of countries to analyze the link between credit ratings and bond spreads. The results indicate that bond spreads react strongly to credit ratings, especially to downgrades in the non-investment grade category. The results are robust to a variety of additional tests."

After having estimated the model using daily euro-area data, I explore the behaviour of risk premia at the short end of the yield curve. These risk premia are neglected by the widely-used practice that consists in backing out market forecasts of future policy-rate moves from money-market forward rates. The results suggest that this practice is valid in terms of sign of the expected target moves, but that it tends to overestimate their size. As an additional contribution, the model is exploited to simulate forward-guidance measures. A credible commitment of the central bank to keep its policy rate unchanged for a given period of time can result in substantial declines in yields. For instance, a central-bank commitment to keep the policy rate at 1% over the next 2 years would imply a decline in the 5-year rate of about 25 basis points."

 """,2012.,Bank leverage shocks and the macroeconomy: a new look in a data-rich environment,"394, Banque de France.","The recent crisis has revealed the potentially dramatic consequences of allowing the build-up of an overstretched leverage of the financial system, and prompted proposals by bank supervisors to significantly tighten bank capital requirements as part of the new Basel 3 regulations. Although these proposals have been fiercely debated ever since, the empirical question of the macroeconomic consequences of shocks to banks' leverage, be they policy induced or not, remains still largely unsettled. In this paper, we aim to overcome some longstanding identification issues hampering such assessments and propose a new approach based on a data-rich environment at both the micro (bank) level and the macro level, using a combination of bank panel regressions and macroeconomic factor models. We first identify bank leverage shocks at the micro level and aggregate them to an economy-wide measure. We then compute impulse responses of a large array of macroeconomic indicators to our aggregate bank leverage shock, using the new methodology developed by Ng and Stevanovic (2012). We find significant and robust evidence of a contractionary impact of an unexpected shock reducing the leverage of large banks."

But how to measure properly competitiveness, beyond price or cost competitiveness, remains an open methodological issue; and what is the resilience of producers located in the EU to the competition of emerging economies is disregarded. We analyze the redistribution of world market shares at the level of product variety, as countries no longer specialize in sectors or even products, but in varieties of the same product, sold at different prices. We decompose changes in market shares into structural effects (geographic and sectoral) and a pure performance effect. Our method is based on an econometric shift-share decomposition and we consider the EU-27 as an integrated economy, excluding intra-EU trade. Revisiting the competitiveness issue in such perspective sheds new light on the ongoing debate. From 1995 to 2009 the EU-27 withstood the competition of emerging countries better than the US and Japan. The EU market shares in the upper price range of the market proved quite resilient, by cumulating good performance and favorable structure effects, contrary to the US and Japan. Finally, while most developed countries lose market shares in high-technology products to developing countries, the EU is slightly gaining, benefiting of a favorable structure effect."

When welfare economics describes the fundamentals of green growth, with innovation as a cornerstone for the management of externalities, it does not confront the financial aspects of the problem. However, the transformation of the economy towards more environmentally friendly practices requires significant investments, and their financing is likely to constitute, in practice, a bottleneck. Thus, it is not excluded that economically beneficial investments that would be capable of generating growth do not emerge because of a lack of funding. This study reviews the main findings of the literature in this regard and shows the different types of actions that may be considered by public authorities to remove this obstacle. In France, public support for green growThéoccurs through two main sets of measures. On the one hand, the investments related to the implementation of the Grenelle Environment Forum and, secondly, through some programs included in the ""Investing for the Future"" program.

We show how the number of imprudent intermediaries is determined in equilibrium jointly with the interest rate, and how both ultimately depend on the cross-sectional distribution of intermediaries capital. One implication of our analysis is that an exogenous increase in the supply of funds to the intermediary sector (following, e.g., capital inflows) lowers interest rates and raises the number of imprudent intermediaries (the risk-taking channel of low interest rates). Another one is that easy financing may lead an increasing number of intermediaries to gamble for resurrection following a bad shock to the sector s capital, again raising economy wide systemic risk (the gambling-for-resurrection channel of falling equity)."

Regulatory constraints would become really binding when workers or unions use them as a tool to oppose management s decisions; ii) regulatory constraints interacted with branch or firm agreement has a positive significant impact on TFP. These agreements, which can only be obtained if labour relations are supportive, would be used by firms to offset the negative impact of regulatory constraints.

While the recovery programs undertaken during the 2008 crisis have led to a big takeoff in public debt ratios, the factors likely to curb its upward spiraling dynamic are subject to considerable uncertainty and fuel debate among economists. Are budgetary consolidations alone sufficient? Is there a need to return to inflationary policies, or is strong economic growth the essential factor to bring about a drop in the public debt ratio? The present paper proposes a long term retrospective study of the French case. A model of advanced indicators for the debt ratio is proposed whose results are interpreted in the light of the historical context. It is shown that from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 1950s, growth, inflation and primary balances were factors capable of explaining the alternation between upward and downward phases in the debt ratio. Then, during the three decades of the post-war boom, very high inflation and economic growth masked nascent budgetary imbalances while the so-called stop and go policies were privileged.

Using a panel of 18 industrialized countries from 1978 to 2009, we find that income inequality significantly rises during periods of fiscal consolidation. In addition, while fiscal policy that is driven by spending cuts seems to be detrimental for income distribution, tax hikes seem to have an equalizing effect. We also show that the size of the fiscal consolidation program (in percentage of GDP) has an impact on income inequality. In particular, when consolidation plans represent a small share of GDP, the income gap widens, suggesting that the burden associated with the effort affects disproportionately households at the bottom of the income distribution. Considering the linkages between banking crises and fiscal consolidation, we find that the effect on the income gap is amplified when fiscal adjustments take place after the resolution of such financial turmoils. Similarly, fiscal consolidation programs combined with inflation are likely to increase inequality and the effects of fiscal adjustments on inequality are amplified during periods of relatively low growth. Our results also provide support for a nonlinear relationship between inequality and income and corroborate the idea that trade can promote a more equal distribution of income."

The case of developed countries,"380, Banque de France.","Measuring an intermediation rate is a good way of capturing the importance of the role of financial intermediaries in a given economy and their position in the face of the growth in market financing. Results show a quite sizeable decline in the financial intermediation rate in France over the period concerned, characterised by the strong growThéof capital markets and the increasing use made by non-financial agents of non-intermediated financing. This development should nevertheless be treated cautiously, for several reasons. First, because it stems largely from the internationalisation of the financing and investing movements of resident financial institutions (FIs) and of market financing received by non-financial agents. Thus, an increasing proportion of resident FIs' assets are held vis- -vis non-residents and a growing share of the financing received by residents comes from the ""Rest of the world"", mainly from non-resident FIs. Second, because an analysis of the revenue of financial intermediaries confirms the change in their price setting practices and a shift in their activities. Lastly, because the choice by non-financial agents is not only made between intermediaries and direct-market access. First of all, this article analyses the changes in the intermediation rate in France and abroad. A growing share Is accounted for by the Rest of the world, while the financing of the national economy by resident FIs has declined. Conversely, resident FIs have developed their operations with the Rest of the world. A broader concept of intermediation is then proposed in order to deal with the so-called decline in financial intermediation. A complementary view of intermediation revenue makes it possible to measure the developments in resident FIs' earnings and to understand the changes that have enabled them to maintain their revenue."

While some of the questions asked have a relatively long history, the methods used to undertake our investigations are very new, and the time-varying structure allows us to offer a more detailed picture. In using these methods we also undertake a substantial technical discussion to unearth the appropriateness of the TVP-SVAR models hitherto estimated in the literature, in particular the role of the choice of priors in determining the outcome of the estimations.

We estimate a vector autoregressive (VAR) model for the Brazilian economy and identify interest rate and reserve requirement shocks. For both instruments a discretionary tightening leads to a decline in domestic credit. We find, however, very different effects for other macroeconomic aggregates. In contrast to interest rate policy, a positive reserve requirement shock leads to an exchange rate depreciation and an improvement in the current account, but also to an increase in prices.

Households sometimes choose to default on their loans, and when they do this triggers forced selling by the shadow banks. Because the forced selling comes when net worThéof potential buyers is low, the ensuing price dynamics can be described as a fire sale. The proposed framework can assess five different policy options that officials have advocated for combating defaults, credit crunches and fire sales, namely: limits on loan to value ratios, capital requirements for banks, liquidity coverage ratios for banks, dynamic loan loss provisioning for banks, and margin requirements on repurchase agreements used by shadow banks.

It uses a panel database of 4,136 observations, comprising industry-level data on 17 OECD countries over the period 1988 to 2007. This dataset merges the STAN database and regulation indicators, both compiled by the OECD. Our approach presents three original features. First, the empirical analysis is carried out in two steps. The first explains the rent creation process. For each country-industry-year observation, the size of rents, measured by the value added price relative to the GDP price, is assumed to depend solely on direct anti-competitive regulations on services and goods. The second step explains the rent sharing process. The second original feature is that three destinations of rents are distinguished for each country-industry-year observation: upstream industries, capital and labour. Finally, the cross-country-industry analysis makes it possible to estimate more complex relations than at the country data level. The main empirical findings are as follows. Regarding the rent creation step, direct anti-competitive regulations are associated with a very significant rise in rent size. Concerning the rent sharing step, the capital share in value added appears to i) increase with rent size, decrease with anti-competitive regulation in upstream sectors and increase with the industry specific output gap; ii) decrease with the national output gap, increase with the national employment rate and decrease with employment protection regulation; iii) increase with the interaction of rent size and the unemployment rate and decrease with the interaction of rent size and employment protection regulations. These results confirm the existence of three destinations for rents (labour remuneration, capital remuneration and upstream industries). They also show that the magnitude of each destination depends on the market power of its beneficiary. All these results are robust to a variety of sensitivity checks."

We use two series of average wage: the average hourly blue-collar wage rate (SHBO) and the average wage per capita (SMPT). We combine these series with aggregate data for the overall economy over four decades from 1970 to 2009, going from the SMIC first implementation (in 1970) to the change in the annual calendar of mandatory increases (in 2009) from the 1st of July to the 1st of January by the law of the 3rd December 2008. We provide three original contributions with respect to the existing literature. First, our study is based on data from a much longer period of time which gives us more information. Second, the models we estimate allow for a very gradual impact of the minimum wage on the average wage, while previous studies often assumed only an immediate impact. Third, we differentiate the impact of minimum wage increases on the average wage by distinguishing between the effects of each of the three sources of increase. Our results confirm the advantages of this approach. Because of the discretionary increases of the minimum wage from the government (the so-called coup de pouces ), the minimum wage increased more rapidly than the average wage over the period 1970-2009. Our estimates suggest that the impact on the average wage of minimum wage increases is strong. This impact is larger than in previous studies because our models take into account the existence of dynamic diffusion effects. Finally, minimum wage increases related to the legal indexation to half of the increase in the purchasing power of the SHBO have a large effect on the SHBO itself. This result suggests that a feedback effect between the minimum wage and the SHBO is possible and could trigger the dynamics between these series.

We emphasize instead the importance of distinguishing between global and local shocks. We exploit a panel of 276 micro price levels collected on a semi-annual frequency from 1990 to 2010 across 88 cities in 59 countries around the world, that enables us to distinguish between different types (local and global) of micro and macro shocks. We find that global shocks have more persistent effects on prices as compared to local ones e.g. prices respond faster to local macro shocks than to global micro ones, implying that the relatively slow response of prices to macro shocks documented in recent studies comes from global rather than local sources. Global macro shocks have the most persistent effect on prices, with the majority of goods and locations sharing a single source of trend over time stemming from these shocks. Finally, both local macro and local micro shocks are associated with relatively fast price convergence."

To do so, it exploits a unique transaction-level dataset on French firms containing information on cross-border monthly transactions matched with data on worldwide intra-firm linkages as defined by property rights (multinational business groups, hierarchies of firms). This newly assembled dataset allows us to distinguish firm-level transactions among two alternative organizational modes of global value chains: internalization of activities (intra-group trade/trade among related parties) or establishment of supply contracts (arm s length trade/trade among unrelated parties). After an overall assessment of the role of global value chains during the trade collapse, we document that intra-group trade in intermediates was characterized by a faster drop followed by a faster recovery than arm s length trade. Amplified fluctuations in terms of trade elasticities by value chains have been referred to as the ""bullwhip effect"" and have been attributed to the adjustment of inventories within supply chains. In this paper we first confirm the existence of such an effect due to trade in intermediates, and we underline the role that different organizational modes can play in driving this adjustment."

Contrary to a conventional interest rate policy, reserve requirements become more effective when there is foreign currency debt."

Using various econometric approaches, we find that a rise in the Brazilian tax on portfolio bond inflows has been affecting other Latin-American economies through significant surges in portfolio funds invested either in fixed income or equity securities. The effect is usually short lasting and followed by rapid reductions in those inflows. Yet it can be large.

The arbitrage-free valuation framework involves five factors and two regimes, one of the latter being interpreted as a crisis regime. These common factors and regimes explain most of the fluctuations in euro-area yields and spreads. The regime-switching feature of the model turns out to be particularly relevant to capture the rise in volatility experienced by fixed-income markets over the last years. In our reduced-form set up, each country is characterized by a hazard rate, specified as some linear combinations of the factors and regimes. The hazard rates incorporate both liquidity and credit components, that we aim at disentangling. The estimation suggests that a substantial share of the changes in euro-area yield differentials is liquidity-driven. Our approach is consistent with the fact that sovereign default risk is not diversifiable, which gives rise to specific risk premia that are incorporated in spreads. Once liquidity-pricing effects and risk premia are filtered out of the spreads, we obtain estimates of the actual or real-world default probabilities. The latter turn out to be significantly lower than their risk-neutral counterparts."

In rolling sub-samples, we document that the transmission of technology shocks to hours worked has been varying over time. We argue that this change is due to the increase of the elasticity of factor substitution. That is, labor and capital became less complementary throughout the sample inducing a change in the sign and size of the response of hours.

The existence of a common monetary policy under European Monetary Union determines the short end of the yield curves, whereas decentralized debt policies drive expected default probabilities and thereby spreads towards Germany, assumed to be free of default risk. The pricing factors are three observable area-wide macroeconomic variables and measures of national fiscal sustainability, which we proxy by expected changes in debt/GDP ratios of the respective countries. Our model explains spreads both before and during the crisis to an impressive extent. The deterioration in public finances was the major driver of the widening in spreads since 2008 through both heightened compensations for default risk and increases in risk premia. We also present perceived probabilities of sovereign default at any maturity and assess their elasticity to shifts in expected changes in debt/GDP ratios."

We estimate the dynamic MES recently proposed by Brownlees and Engle (2011) for a panel of 65 large US banks over the last decade and a half. Running panel regressions of the MES on bank characteristics, we first find that the MES can be roughly rationalized in terms of standard balance sheet indicators of bank financial soundness and systemic importance. We then ask whether the cross section of the MES can help to identify ex ante, i.e. before a crisis unfolds, which institutions are the more likely to suffer the most severe losses ex post, i.e. once it has unfolded. Unfortunately, using the recent crisis as a natural experiment, we find that standard balance-sheet metrics like the tier one solvency ratio are better able than the MES to predict equity losses conditionally to a true crisis."

In this paper, I provide a framework in which fiat money has value in equilibrium, even though a higher-return asset is available and there are neither restrictions nor transaction costs in using it. I suggest that the use of money is associated with frictions underlying debt contracts. In an environment where full enforcement is not feasible, the actual rate of return on assets is determined by incentives eliciting voluntary debt repayment.

We adjust for endogeneity biases by means of instrumental variables. The main results obtained from the estimation of capital retirement models may be summarised as follows: i) The retirement rate decreases with the variations in cyclical pressures measured by the changes in output and the workweek of capital; this relation corresponds to a countercyclical decelerator effect on capital retirement; ii) The capital retirement rate increases with the structural intensity of capital utilisation; this effect, which corresponds to a wear and tear one, is nevertheless small compared to the decelerator one; iii) The profit rate does not have a significant impact on the retirement rate. Compared with the existing literature, here mainly Mairesse and Dormont (1985), the contribution of these results is to show, through the use of unique survey data, that the effect of the intensity of capital utilisation on capital retirement is structurally positive, via a wear and tear effect, and cyclically negative, via a decelerator effect which completes that already taken into account via the effect of changes in value added."

Thus, while previous confidence intervals for median-unbiased half-lives are consistent with virtually anything, our tighter confidence intervals are inconsistent with economic models with nominal rigidities as candidates for explaining the observed behavior of real exchange rates and move us away from solving the PPP puzzle."

We apply to that end a newly developed methodology based on high dimensional VAR theory. This approach features a dominant unit to a large set of over 60 countries' real effective exchange rates and is based on the comparison of two estimated systems: one before and one after EMU. We find strong evidence that the pattern of responses depends crucially on the nature of global shocks. In particular, post-EMU responses to global US dollar shocks have become similar to Germany's response before EMU, i.e. to that of the economy that used to issue Europe's most credible legacy currency. By contrast, post-EMU responses of euro area countries to global risk aversion shocks have become similar to those of Italy, Portugal or Spain before EMU, i.e. of economies of the euro area's periphery. Our findings also suggest that the divergence in external competitiveness among euro area countries over the last decade, which is at the core of today's debate on the future of the euro area, is more likely due to country-specific shocks than to global shocks."

In the Borjas (2003) specification, we find that a 10% increase in immigration increases native wages by 3%. However, as the number of immigrants and the number of natives are positively and strongly correlated across cells, the immigrant share may not be a good measure of the immigration shock. When the log of natives and the log of immigrants are used as regressors instead, the impact of immigration on natives wages is still positive but much smaller, and natives wages are negatively related to the number of natives. To understand this asymmetry and the positive impact of immigration on wages, we explore the link between immigration and the occupational distribution of natives within education/experience cells. Our results suggest that immigration leads to the reallocation of natives to better-paid occupations within education/experience cells."

We show that (i) migration could have a substantial impact on GDP growth in sending and destination regions; (ii) endogenizing migration induces important changes in the volume and the distribution of migration flows between regions compared to the United-Nations projections; (iii) the size of these flows, although substantial, will not be sufficient to counteract the impact of population ageing in the receiving regions."

Such an assessment plays a central role in the determination of the structural deficit and therefore in the definition of consolidation plans. After presenting the possible effects of the crisis on potential growth identified by the literature, we use for our evaluations an unobserved component model. This helps to reconcile the so-called traditional approaches, based on the use of a production function and the statistical approaches based on filtering methods. Our evaluations show for the different areas that the crisis has had a significant impact on potential growth starting in 2009; by 2012, potential growth should remain weak. The low potential growth is caused in part by a sharp decline in labor input, particularly in France and the euro area. This decline stems mainly from an increase of structural unemployment, except in Germany."

In this paper, we assess the ability of a general equilibrium New Keynesian asset-pricing model to account for these facts. The model we consider allows for staggered price and wage setting, as well as time-varying risk aversion through habit formation. We find that the model predicts a stock market response to policy shocks that matches empirical estimates, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our findings are robust to a range of variations and parameterizations of the model."

It develops a model in which, lower access to external finance, or reduced internal liquidity, hampers the firm ability to finance the recurrent costs to serve foreign markets and decreases firm survival in foreign markets. Additionally, financial constraints act as a barrier to firm export expansion by decreasing the firm ability to finance the entry costs into new export markets; thus, they push firm to avoid losing destinations. We use a unique longitudinal dataset on French firms that contains information on export destinations of individual firms and allows us to construct various firm-level measures of financial constraints to test these predictions. We obtain two main results. First, credit constraints have a negative effect on the number of newly served destinations. Second, higher probability of exit from the export market is also associated with credit constraints; that is consistent with constraints limiting the financing of recurrent export costs."

However, while stock prices immediately adjust to the shock and the effect of fiscal policy is temporary, housing prices gradually and persistently fall. Consequently, the attempts of fiscal policy to mitigate stock price developments (e.g. via taxes on capital gains) may severely de-stabilize housing markets. The empirical findings also point to significant fiscal multiplier effects in the context of severe housing busts, which gives rise to the importance of the implementation of fiscal stimulus packages. In addition, our results suggest that when governments run a budget deficit, they place an upward pressure on real interest rates, which ""crowds-out"" private consumption and investment. In contrast, during bust periods, unexpected variation in the fiscal stance crowds-in private spending, which reflects the ""direct"" and ""indirect"" effects of policy actions impact arising from a downward movement in real interest rates and an upward revision in price level expectations."

We examine here a two-sector model with two primary energy resources, a polluting exhaustible resource and an expensive carbon-free renewable resource, in which an environmental regulation is imposed through a cap on the atmospheric carbon stock. We assume that only the emissions from one sector can be captured. Previous literature, based on one-sector models in which all emissions are capturable, finds that CCS technology should not be used before the threshold has been reached. We find that, when technical constraints make it impossible to capture emissions from both sectors, this result does not always hold. CCS technology should be used before the ceiling is reached if non capturable emissions are large enough. In that case, we find that energy prices paths must differ between sectors reflecting the difference of social cost of the resource according to its use. Numerical exercise shows that the initial carbon tax should equal 52$/t CO2 and that using CCS before the ceiling is optimal."

We find that there has so far been a moderate increase in actual protectionist measures to restrict trade through tariff and non-tariff barriers. At the same time, evidence from surveys shows that public pressure for more economic protection has been mounting since the mid-2000s, and has possibly intensified since the start of the financial crisis. However, no World Trade Organization (WTO) member has retreated into widespread trade restrictions or protectionism to date. Our model-based simulations suggest that the impairment of the global flow of trade would hamper the recovery from the crisis, as well as the long-term growThéof the global economy. At the same time, it is unlikely that protectionism would help to correct existing current account imbalances. Moreover, the countries implementing protectionist measures should expect a deterioration of their international competitiveness, which would further affect the potential for longer-term real GDP growth."

Given the nonlinear/non-Gaussian state-space form, approximating the likelihood for the parameters is conducted wiThéoutput generated by the particle filter. Methods are employed to ensure that the approximating likelihood is continuous as a function of the unknown parameters thus enabling the use of standard Newton-Raphson type maximization algorithms. Our approach is robust and efficient relative to alternative Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes employed in such contexts. In addition it provides a feasible basis for undertaking the nontrivial task of model comparison. Furthermore, we introduce new volatility model, namely SV-GARCH which attempts to bridge the gap between GARCH and stochastic volatility specifications. In nesting the standard GARCH model as a special case, it has the attractive feature of inheriting the same unconditional properties of the standard GARCH model but being conditionally heavier-tailed; thus more robust to outliers. It is demonstrated how this model can be estimated using the described methodology. The technique is applied to daily returns data for S&P 500 stock price index for various spans. In assessing the relative performance of SV with leverage and jumps and nested specifications, we find strong evidence in favour of a including leverage effect and jumps when modelling stochastic volatility. Additionally, we find very encouraging results for SV-GARCH in terms of predictive ability which is comparable to the other models considered."

We apply the model to an analysis of multinational firms sourcing strategies and predict that (1) complex and specific inputs are more likely to be sourced from financially developed countries and (2) multinationals are more likely to integrate suppliers located in countries with poor financial institutions, especially when trade involves complex goods. We examine and validate these predictions using firm-level trade data on multinational firms wiThéoperations in France. We provide evidence that financial development generates a comparative advantage in the supply of complex goods. Moreover, we find higher shares of intra-firm imports of complex inputs from countries with a lower level of financial development. The findings are robust to different measures of complexity and specificity, and are not driven by industry differences in fixed costs or traditional measures of external financial dependence. Quantitatively, we find that financial development is as important as contract enforcement in alleviating hold-up problems."

We emphasize that at the safer equilibrium the less productive or smaller jurisdiction leads and hence loses the second-mover advantage. If asymmetry among jurisdictions is sufficient, Pareto-dominance reinforces risk-domination in selecting the same SPE. Three results may be deduced from our analysis: (i) the downward pressure on tax rates is less severe than predicted; (ii) the smaller jurisdiction leads; (iii) the 'big-country-higher-tax-rate' rule does not always hold.

The implied higher stock of liquidity also loosens the borrowing constraints faced by firms, thereby raising labour demand and possibly the real wage. Whether private consumption and wages actually rise or fall ultimately depends on the relative strengths of the liquidity and wealth effects that arise following the shock. The expansionary effects of tax cuts are also discussed. Classification-JEL: E21; E62."

The focus is in particular on UK and Spain. We use a Markov Switching FAVAR framework and regime-dependent impulse response functions. The `Crisis' regime which we identify endogenously is shown to also correspond to an exogenously determined index of frequency of financial crises in OECD countries, which peaked in the early 1990s and in the more recent Subprime crisis. Furthermore, we find that the response of domestic house price to a shock to a common (global) house price factor during a `Crisis' regime is relatively more amplified than in a `Normal' (more tranquil) regime.

Ricardian equivalence does not hold due to the presence of monetary frictions, modeled here as reserve requirements. When capital markets are integrated, the fiscal policy of one country influences equilibrium wages and interest rates. Under certain rules, monetary policy may respond to the price variations induced by regional fiscal policies. Depending on the type of rule it adopts, interventions by the monetary authority affect the magnitude and nature of the spillover from regional fiscal policy."

Our simulations of these rules over the next five years lead us to conclude that two groups of countries could emerge as regards their respective budgetary situations. On the one hand, some virtuous countries whose structural deficits will diminish whatever the exit crisis scenario envisaged, whereas on the other side, others will not succeed in stabilizing their national debt ratio, because their discretionary fiscal policy is less pro cyclical."

We include factors summarizing large sets of individual bank balance sheet ratios in a standard factor-augmented vector autoregression model (FAVAR) of the French economy. We first find that factors extracted from banks' liquidity and leverage ratios predict macroeconomic fluctuations. This suggests a potential scope for macroprudential policies aimed at dampening the procyclical effects of adjustments in banks' balance sheets structure. However, we also find that fluctuations in bank ratio factors are largely irrelevant for the transmission of monetary shocks. Thus, there is little point monitoring the information contained in bank balance sheets, above the information already contained in credit aggregates, as far as monetary policy transmission is concerned."

The theoretical literature emphasises the existence of a separation principle between the first policy, which seeks to ensure monetary stability and the other two policies, which are intended to ensure financial stability through the smooth functioning of the interbank money market. This paper shows in particular that a central bank not only has the capacity but indeed must strive to separate the conduct of its monetary policy, which must seek to ensure medium and long-term price stability, from that of its credit policy, which is driven by short-term imperatives and consists in supplying the banking system with liquidity in the event of temporary money demand shocks. During the first part of the crisis, the ECB acted in accordance with the separation principle. However, it became increasingly difficult to apply as interest rates approached the zero-lower-bound. In effect, the unconventional measures adopted by the ECB created interference between its monetary policy, its credit policy and its interest rate policy."

To this end, we use a quantile regression analysis covering the period from 1999 to 2007. The heterogeneity is very pronounced when the regions face a negative shock on debt, for instance a tightening of financial conditions. We explain our findings as a consequence of the fact that the Golden rule can be thought of as a soft rule if some local administrations believe that a financial rescue from the central government is automatic (as the regions receive transfers from the later). In this case, some regions find it advantageous to consider borrowing as an adjustment variable when taking their budgetary decisions."

Some 30 percent of settlements stipulate several predetermined wage changes during the year following the date of signature of the agreement. The frequency of wage agreements is highly seasonal, but the dates at which agreements take effect are more staggered. The date at which the national minimum wage level is revised each year has a significant impact on the timetable of wage agreements, both at the firm- and at the industry-levels. Wage increases negotiated at these two levels mainly depend on the inflation regime, the firm profitability and the proportion of minimum-wage workers in the same industry."

We find that these nonlinearities are both frequent (as they exist on all behaviors analyzed: real GDP, private consumption, business investment and private employment) and significant. For this, we estimate time-varying probability Markov-switching models (TVPMS) in order to take into account two budgetary regimes, on the one side periods of severe recessions or depressions (crises), and, on the other side ""normal"" periods (expansions or moderate recessions). These two regimes are identified endogenously, so that we do not need to preliminary separate episodes of huge contractions and expansions of the business cycle. Further, we are able to identify the variables influencing the probability of a switch between regimes. Searching for nonlinear fiscal impacts in the form of regime-switching effects, we assume temporary variations in the budgetary variables, boThéon the revenue side (taxes on consumption, on firm's profit, lump sum transfers) and on the expenditure side (traditional public boosts of aggregate demand, transfers, and subsidies). Our results show that if one considers the aggregate GDP, public expenditure has a stronger impact during crisis and the expenditure multiplier is greater than the tax multiplier. Also, when households are sensitive to the unemployment situation, tax cuts do not increase consumption spending, while transfers are playing a significant role. On the firms side, our results show that direct taxes changes induce a (stimulus) effect in the investment rate only during non-crisis periods. A rise in subsidies has a negative influence during crises. Finally, the estimates suggest that employment policies should be asymmetric: fiscal measures aiming at reducing unit labor costs could be efficient in good times, while an increase in public employment is preferable during crisis."

We show that SV-M models deliver results preferable to those of log-GARCH-M models, despite the high computational cost of their estimation. SV-M models fit generally better data than log-GARCH-M ones. As their residuals do not violate distribution assumptions, they do not deliver dubious conclusions concerning the significance of the relationship, which is the case of the log-GARCH-model for France, the UK and the US.

 """,2010.,Do product market regulations in upstream sectors curb productivity growth? Panel data evidence for OECD countries,"283, Banque de France.","The paper focuses on the influence of upstream competition for productivity outcomes in downstream sectors. This relation is illustrated with a neo-Schumpeterian theoretical model of innovation (Aghion et al., 1997) with market imperfections in the production of intermediate goods. In this context, upstream market imperfections create barriers to competition in downstream markets and upstream producers use their market power to share innovation rents sought by downstream firms. Thus, lack of competition in upstream markets curbs incentives to improve productivity downstream, negatively affecting productivity outcomes. We test this prediction by estimating an error correction model that differentiates the potential downstream effects of lack of upstream competition in situations close and far from the global technological frontier. We measure competition upstream with regulatory burden indicators derived from OECD data on sectoral product market regulation and the industry-level efficiency improvement and the distance to frontier variables by means of a multifactor productivity (MFP) index. Panel regressions are run for 15 OECD countries and 20 sectors over the 1985-2007 period with country, sector and year fixed effects. We find clear evidence that anticompetitive regulations in upstream sectors have curbed MFP growth downstream over the past 15 years. These effects tend to be strongest for observations (i.e. country/sector/period triads) that are close to the global technological frontier. Our results suggest that, measured at the average distance to frontier and average level of anticompetitive regulations, the marginal effect of increasing competition by easing such regulations is to increase MFP growth by between 1 and 1.5 per cent per year in the OECD countries covered by our sample. Our results are robust to changes in the way MFP and the regulatory burden indicators are constructed, as well as to variations in the sample of countries and/or sectors."

This relationship is expressed in two ways: in terms of Marginal Propensity to Consume out of wealth (MPC) and in terms of Elasticity of consumption to wealth. Three concepts of consumption are investigated: total households consumption expenditure, consumption excluding financial services and consumption excluding durable goods. Different estimators are also considered. Based on the MPC approach, when considered as permanent by households, an increase (decrease) in total wealThéof one euro would lead to an increase (decrease) of 1 cent in total consumption. In terms of elasticity, an increase (de- crease) of 10% in wealth would imply also a relatively small impact of 0.8 to 1.1% on consumption depending on the concept of consumption considered. In most cases, the effect of a change in financial wealth is bigger than of a change in housing wealth. The results indicate that the wealth effects are smaller in France than in the UK and US but close to what is observed in Italy. In addition, any deviation of the variables from their common trends is corrected at first by adjustments in disposable income in line with what has been uncovered by studies on Germany and consistent with the ""saving for the rainy days"" approach of Campbell (1987).

An interesting finding is that, even allowing for other channels of international transmission (through global interest rates, or activity), the US real house price, which appears to be exogenous in the US dynamics, unidirectionally causes the international house price factor, which in turn causes the domestic real house price growth for several countries.

During the past century, the United States has overtaken the United Kingdom and become the leading world economy. During the past 25 years, the four countries have also experienced contrasting advances in productivity, in particular as a result of unequal investment in information and communication technology (ICT). The past 120 years have been characterized by: (i) rapid economic growth and large productivity gains in all four countries; (ii) a long decline in productivity in the United Kingdom relative to the United States, and to a lesser extent also relative to France and Japan, a relative decline that was interrupted by the second world war (WW2); (iii) the remarkable catching-up to the United States by France and Japan after WW2, interrupted in the case of Japan during the 1990s. Capital deepening (at least to the extent this can be measured) accounts for a large share of the variations in performance; increasingly during the past 25 years, this has meant ICT capital deepening. However, the capital contribution to growth varies considerably over time and across the four countries, and it is always less important, except in Japan, than the contribution of the various other factors underlying TFP growth, such as, among others, labor skills, technical and organizational changes and knowledge spillovers. Most recently (in 2006), before the current financial world crisis, hourly labor productivity levels were slightly higher in France than in the United States, and noticeably lower in the United Kingdom (by roughly 10%) and even lower in Japan (30%), while TFP levels are very close in France, the United Kingdom and the United States, but much lower (40%) in Japan."

In addition, a disaggregated approach taking into account several different types of fiscal measures highlights that tax and interest rate subsidies are the most efficient fiscal tool for influencing residential investment. When accounting for financial factors by means of households' borrowing capacity, we find that the latter also impacts residential investment positively. Moreover, this alternative specification underlines the robustness of the above mentioned results, as it confirms subsidies as the most efficient measure to influence residential investment."

 """,2009.,Stockholding: Does housing wealth matter?,"266, Banque de France.","The existence of an equity premium puzzle has been largely emphasized in the empirical literature: one observes low risky assets holding that the standard portfolio choice model (with expected and discounting utility and homothetic preferences) is not able to explain. Besides modifications of rationality assumptions, other changes have been introduced in the standard framework to account for this equity premium puzzle: the existence of transaction costs, liquidity constraints or other risks (e.g. risks associated with employment, income, health,). These background risks (i.e. risks that are unavoidable, exogenous and independent from the financial market risk) may lead households to reduce their stockownership in order to limit their global exposure to risk. Recent developments examine the role of housing on stockholding as another background risk. This paper analyses the empirical link between stockholding and housing wealth within this framework. We use the French wealth survey (Enqu te Patrimoine 2004, Insee) that gives us detailed information on households portfolio, socio-demographic variables, and several measures of preference and exposition to various risks (income, unemployment, health, and business). We find that an increase in the housing to net wealth ratio crowds out stock market investment for a given total financial wealth: when facing real estate exposure to risk, households tend to moderate their global exposure to risk by limiting the share of their financial wealth invested in stocks. Among the other significant determinants of the equity premium puzzle, we emphasize the role of transaction and information costs, the attitude toward risk and the exposition to various risks in hampering investments in stocks."

Using U.S post-war data, we provide empirical evidence in favor of the existence of a cointegration relationship with a structural break in the mid-eighties. Moreover, we show that until the beginning of 2000, consumption spending and housing wealth were dominated by permanent shocks. The main variable that adjusts to restore the long-run trend when a deviation occurs is the financial wealth and therefore it presents the main transitory variations in total wealth. However, over the last period 2000-2009, most of transitory shocks in total wealth are associated to fluctuations in the housing component of wealth rather than financial wealth. Besides, we found that a small fraction of transitory changes in wealth is associated with movements in consumption.

Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset-price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting asset-price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. We infer the probability that an asset-price boom turns into an asset-price bust. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly asset-price booms. We find some evidence that house price booms are more likely to turn into costly recession than stock price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability of a set of indicators to robustly explain costly asset-price booms. According to our results, real long-term interest rates, total investment, real credit and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly housing-price boom, whereas real GDP and house prices tend to increase the probability of a costly stock-price boom. Regarding the latter, credit variables tend to play a less convincing role. From this perspective, we specify the scope of macro-prudential regulation as a set of tools aiming at avoiding ""costly"" asset-price booms. In doing so, we try both to make the case for state-contingent macro-prudential regulations and to set out clear delineation between monetary and financial stability objectives."

At business-cycle frequencies, the variance of interest payments is lower when nominal long-term bonds are issued. From a budget-smoothing perspective, debt service variability plays a major role, but pro- or counter-cyclicality of debt service also matters. In this respect, the results suggest that while interest payments associated with medium- to long-term nominal bonds are negatively correlated with real activity, those associated with inflation-linked bonds and short-term nominal bonds tend to be pro-cyclical."

Out-of-sample results over the period 2007-2008 show that financial variables would have been helpful in predicting a recession signal as September 2007, that is around six months before the effective start of the 2008-2009 recession in the euro area."

First, we present a simple theoretical model showing that judicial case outcomes cannot be directly interpreted in terms of EPL. A large fraction of cases that go to trials may well be a sign of low firing costs when firms face low litigation costs and are therefore willing to go to court or a sign of high firing costs when workers face low litigation costs and are therefore willing to sue the firm. Second, we exploit our model as well as the French institutional setting to generate instruments for these endogenous outcomes. Using these instruments, we show that labor courts decisions have a causal effect on labor flows. More dropped cases and more trials cause more job destructions: more trials indeed are a sign of lower separation costs. More settlements, higher filing rates, a larger fraction of workers represented at trial, large lawyer density dampen job destruction. A larger judge density causes less job creation, in particular on the extensive margin."

The bank bears a relatively high share of the risk initially, as it should have high-powered incentives to monitor, but its long term financial stake tapers off as losses unfold. Liquidity regulation based on securitization can replicate the optimal contract. The sponsor provides an internal credit enhancement out of the proceeds of the sale and extends protection in the form of weighted tranches of collateralized debt obligations. In compensation the trust pays servicing and rent-preserving fees if a long enough period elapses with no losses occurring. Rather than being detrimental, well-designed securitization seems an effective means of implementing the second best."

Based on a small macroeconometric model, the implicit target, not known by the econometrician, is identified through a minimal set of theoretical restrictions: (i) the inflation target is a non stationary process, (ii) inflation is a monetary phenomenon in the long-run, and (iii) changes in the implicit target have no long-run effects whatsoever on real variables. The model is estimated so as to match output growth, changes in inflation and the ex post real interest rate. Our main results are: (i) inflation target shocks account for the bulk of nominal fluctuations; (ii) due to monetary policy inertia and nominal stickiness, changes in the target generate large swings in the real interest rate translating into substantial short-run effects on real variables; (ii) in spite of this inflation target shocks moderately impact on output dynamics."

Three possible explanations of these stylised facts are considered: globalisation, information technology, and competition.

Second, it must be able to propose a joint dynamics of some macroeconomic variables, of the whole curve of interest rates, of the whole set of term premia and, possibly, of various decompositions of the term premia. The first condition is required if we want to disentangle the respective impacts of, for instance, the expectation part of the term premium of a given long-term interest rate on some macroeconomic variable. The second condition is necessary if we want to analyze the interactions between macro-variables with some global features of the yield curve (short part, long part, level, slope and curvature) or with, for instance, term premia of various maturities. In the present paper we propose to satisfy both requirements by using a Near-Cointegrated modelling of basic observables variables, in order to meet the first condition, and the no-arbitrage theory, in order to meet the second one.

 """,2009.,"Time-varying (S, s) band models: empirical properties and interpretation","231, Banque de France.",". A recent strand of empirical work uses (S; s) models with time-varying stochastic bands to describe infrequent adjustments of prices and other variables. The present paper examines some properties of this model, which encompasses most micro-founded adjustment rules rationalizing infrequent changes. We illustrate that this model is also flexible enough to fit data characterized by infrequent adjustment and variable adjustment size. We show that, to the extent that there is variability in the size of adjustments (e.g. if both small and large price changes are observed), i) a large band parameter is needed to fit the data and ii) the average band of inaction underlying the model may differ strikingly from the typical observed size of adjustment. The paper thus provides a rationalization of a recurrent empirical result: very large estimated values for the parameters measuring the band of inaction."

Most countries negotiate wages on several levels, the sectoral level still being the most dominant, with an increasingly important role for bargaining at the firm level. The average lengThéof collective bargaining agreements is found to lie between one and three years.

The model relies on three key assumptions: (i) liquidity provisioning is not verifiable -it cannot be contracted upon-, (ii) banks face moral hazard when confronted with liquidity shocks-unobservable effort can help overcome the shock-, (iii) liquidity shocks are private information - they cannot be diversified away-. Under these assumptions, the equilibrium risk-adjusted return on liquidity provisioning increases with the aggregate equilibrium volume of ex ante liquidity provision. As a consequence, banks may provision too little liquidity compared with the social optimum. Within this framework we derive two main results. First inter-bank market collapse is an equilibrium. Second such an equilibrium is more likely when (i) the individual probability of the liquidity shock is lower, (ii) ex ante competition between banks on illiquid long term assets is larger."

We critically assess the widely used projections of the Working Group on Ageing Populations (AWG) of the EU's Economic Policy Committee and argue that ageing costs may be higher than projected in the AWG reference scenario. Taking into account adjusted headline estimates for ageing costs, largely based upon the sensitivity analysis carried out by the AWG, we consider alternative indicators to quantify sustainability gaps for euro area countries. With respect to the policy implications, we assess the appropriateness of different budgetary strategies to restore fiscal sustainability taking into account intergenerational equity. Our stylised analysis based upon the lifetime contribution to the government's primary balance of different generations suggests that an important degree of pre-funding of the ageing costs is necessary to avoid shifting the burden of adjustment in a disproportionate way to future generations. For many euro area countries this implies that the medium-term targets defined in the context of the revised stability and growth pact would ideally need to be revised upwards to significant surpluses."

 """,2008.,Econometric Asset Pricing Modelling,"223, Banque de France.","The purpose of this paper is to propose a general econometric approach to no-arbitrage asset pricing modelling based on three main ingredients: (i) the historical discrete-time dynamics of the factor representing the information, (ii) the Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF), and (iii) the discrete-time risk-neutral (R.N.) factor dynamics. Retaining an exponential-affine specification of the SDF, its modelling is equivalent to the specification of the risk sensitivity vector and of the short rate, if the latter is neither exogenous nor a known function of the factor. In this general framework, we distinguish three modelling strategies: the Direct Modelling, the Risk-Neutral Constrained Direct Modelling and the Back Modelling. In all the approaches we study the Internal Consistency Conditions (ICCs), implied by the absence of arbitrage opportunity assumption, and the identification problem. The general modelling strategies are applied to two important domains: security market models and term structure of interest rates models. In these contexts we stress the usefulness (and we suggest the use) of the Risk-Neutral Constrained Direct Modelling and of the Back Modelling approaches, both allowing to conciliate a flexible (non-Car) historical dynamics and a Car R.N. dynamics leading to explicit or quasi explicit pricing formulas for various derivative products. Moreover, we highlight the possibility to specify asset pricing models able to accommodate non-Car historical and non-Car R.N. factor dynamics with tractable pricing formulas. This result is based on the notion of (Risk-Neutral) Extended Car process that we introduce in the paper, and which allows to deal with sophisticated models like Gaussian and Inverse Gaussian GARCH-type models with regime-switching, or Wishart Quadratic Term Structure models."

A lot of recent empirical works provide estimates of this proportion and evaluate its stability over time. A second model assumes that prices are state-dependent. Firms have to pay an adjustment cost each time they change their price and it can be optimal to differ a price change. These adjustments costs are empirically measured and empirical studies focus on the impact of these menu costs on the inflation process."

We provide an assessment of these effects through a small simulation experiment. The empirical analysis is devoted to three key indicators, the US GNP, the French IPI and the french contribution to M3 monetary aggregate for the euro zone.

We study this topic from an unified perspective through an extension of Beveridge Nelson decompositions. We show that estimation of the various components of a given time series is feasible once the location of unit roots which drive the persistence of the series have been determined. The precise identification of seasonal unit roots is performed in a preliminary step. Then we derive estimates for each component from a modelization of the raw series which may be parametric (ARMA) or semi parametric, with special attention paid to deterministic components which play a prominent role in the decomposition.

Our main results can be summarized as follows: (i) the share of R&D investment over total investment is countercyclical without credit constraints, but it becomes more procyclical as firms face tighter credit constraints; (ii) the result is magnified for firms in sectors that depend more heavily upon external finance; (iii) in more credit constrained firms, R&D investment share plummets during recessions but does not increase proportionally during upturns; (iv) average R&D investment and productivity growth are more negatively correlated with sales volatility in more credit constrained firms."

 """,2008.,"Competition, R&D, and the Cost of Innovation","197, Banque de France.","This paper proposes a model in the spirit of Aghion et al. (2005) that encompasses the magnitude of the impact of competition on R&D according to the cost of the innovation. The effect of competition on R&D is an inverted U-shape. However, the shape is flatter and competition policy is therefore less relevant for innovation when innovations are relatively costly. Intuitively, if innovations are costly for a firm, competitive shocks have to be significant to alter its innovation decisions. Empirical investigations using a unique panel dataset from the Banque de France show that an inverted U-shaped relationship can be clearly evidenced for the largest firms, but the curve becomes flatter when the relative cost of R&D increases. For large costs, the relationship even vanishes. Consequently, in sectors in which innovations are costly, policy changes have to be on a very large scale for an impact to be expected; at the extreme end, in certain sectors, the curve is so at that competition policy is not an appropriate tool for boosting the research effort of firms."

To reconcile some puzzles in the recent literature on the nature of policy interactions among nations, we prove that games characterized by different commitment and cooperation schemes can admit the same equilibrium outcome if certain spillover effects vanish at the common solution of these games. We provide a detailed discussion of these spillovers, showing that, in general, commitment and cooperation are non-trivial issues. Yet, in linear-quadratic models with multiple policymakers commitment and cooperation schemes are shown to become irrelevant under certain assumptions. The framework is sufficiently general to cover a broad range of results from the recent literature on policy interactions as special cases, both within monetary unions and among fully sovereign nations."

Second, focusing on the role of intra-industry trade, we provide preliminary evidence that this variable can account (i) for the low pass-through of import price to consumer price and (ii) for the flattening of the Phillips curve, i.e. the lower sensitivity of inflation to the output gap."

 """,2008.,An Inflation Forecasting Model for the Euro Area,"192, Banque de France.","With the European economic integration, the understanding of inflation and inflationary pressures requires to analyse both the national level and the whole Euro area level. This is true in particular for the inflation forecasts that are carried out within the Eurosystem and published four times a year in the ECB Monthly Bulletin. For that purpose, the Banque de France is currently building tools for the Euro area in addition to those already in use for France. The present study puts forward a simple model of short-term developments (one year ahead) in inflation, as measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of the Euro area. This model does not take into account the feed-back effect of prices on activity, which should be considered in order to analyse medium-term price developments. It could hence be improved along these lines in the future. The model includes seven equations, explaining the total HICP of the Euro area and some of its sector-based sub-indexes (services, manufacturing sector, unprocessed food, processed food, energy and underlying inflation, defined as HICP inflation excluding unprocessed food and energy prices). It uses exogenous variables such as unit labour cost, import deflator, indicators of tightening in the labour market, or in the goods market, and indirect tax indicators. We have favoured an empirical approach rather than a strict compliance with theoretical models, paying particularly attention to the fit of the equations to the data. However, this model is able to provide relevant economic interpretations of recent price developments. Finally, we assess the forecasting performance of the model in traditional in-sample and out-of-sample rolling event evaluations. To do so, the forecasts were compared to the ones obtained from simple autoregressive equations, which are also commonly used to forecast short-term price developments. On the whole, the model provides more accurate forecasts than those provided by the autoregressive model, and a sector-based disaggregated approach outperforms a single equation to forecast total HICP. Part of this result may come from dummy variables that correspond to well identified shocks that improve both the econometric characteristics and forecast performance of the equations of our model."

Is this debt simply backed by future taxation with no inflationary consequences? Or will the circulation of region debt induce monetization by a central bank? We argue here that boThéoutcomes can arise in equilibrium. In the model economy, there are multiple equilibria which reflect the perceptions of agents regarding the manner in which the debt obligations will be met. In one equilibrium, termed Ricardian, the future obligations are met with taxation by a regional government while in the other, termed Monetization, the central bank is induced to print money to finance the region's obligations. The multiplicity of equilibria reflects a commitment problem of the central bank. A key indicator of the selected equilibrium is the distribution of the holdings of the regional debt. We show that regional governments, anticipating central bank financing of their debt obligations, have an incentive to create excessively large deficits. We use the model to assess the impact of policy measures within a monetary union."

We find that infrequent price changes are not necessarily associated with large adjustment costs. Indeed, extrinsic rigidity appears to be significant in many cases. We also find that asymmetry in the price adjustment could be due to trends in marginal costs and/or desired mark-ups rather than asymmetric cost of adjustment bands."

We show that the assumptions regarding interregional correlations of forecast errors are important in our model: they have a large impact on the uncertainty of the macroeconomic variables, and it appears that the macroeconomic adjustments can differ substantially if we consider independence or high correlation across the regions. In particular, the macroeconomic behaviour of the agents in the current account/saving problem differs significantly across regions according to the degree of interregional correlation."

We obtain that a decrease of prices stickiness does not necessary result in a decrease of the sacrifice ratio. In addition, the sacrifice ratio rises with the degree of wage stickiness."

 """,2007.,DSGE Models in a Data-Rich Environment,"162, Banque de France.","Standard practice for the estimation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models maintains the assumption that economic variables are properly measured by a single indicator, and that all relevant information for the estimation is summarized by a small number of data series. However, recent empirical research on factor models has shown that information contained in large data sets is relevant for the evolution of important macroeconomic series. This suggests that conventional model estimates and inference based on estimated DSGE models might be distorted. In this paper, we propose an empirical framework for the estimation of DSGE models that exploits the relevant information from a data-rich environment. This framework provides an interpretation of all information contained in a large data set, and in particular of the latent factors, through the lenses of a DSGE model. The estimation involves Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods. We apply this estimation approach to a state-of-the-art DSGE monetary model. We find evidence of imperfect measurement of the model's theoretical concepts, in particular for inflation. We show that exploiting more information is important for accurate estimation of the model's concepts and shocks, and that it implies different conclusions about key structural parameters and the sources of economic fluctuations."

We show that in most models these interest-rate rules are necessarily forward-looking (i.e. make necessarily the interest rate conditional on the private agents' expectations), while in all models non-forward-looking interest-rate rules exist which ensure only the local determinacy of the targeted equilibrium. We also discuss the robustness of the effectiveness of these rules to departures from various assumptions and show in particular that they can still be effective when the central bank has imperfect knowledge of the model's structural parameters. We finally argue that such rules could also serve as a useful guide in the reflections on the best monetary policy reaction to perceived asset-price bubbles or exchange-rate misalignments."

A high heterogeneity across sectors is also observed: business-services prices change less often than industrial producer prices. The data lend some support to predictions of both time- and state-dependence models: Taylor contracts are not unusual but prices also respond to the changes in the firm's economic conditions.

We find that adverse weather is associated with higher growth rates of non-food expenditures. Furthermore, richer households are better able to cope with crop failure than poorer households.

In particular, they find that reforms increasing incentives to lower the number of temporary labour contracts do not induce firms to change their long-term labour demand level. Thus, such reforms are not sufficient by themselves to reduce the unemployment rate and to stimulate production and productivity. Fiscal incentives offering income tax credits to households in which a person who was previously not employed find a job, tend to increase labour supply. However, their effectiveness is often limited by the disincentive effects of other transfer policies. In general, structural labour markets reforms cannot succeed when their potential effects are neutralized by inappropriate wage increases. It is thus important to examine the institutional context which determines the wage bargaining process. Several contributions show that, on one side, a higher coordination in the bargaining process could increase labour market flexibility and reduce labour cost, while, on the other side, an excessive decentralisation of the bargaining process could increase the variance of labour contracts. Thus determining the bargaining level which maximizes the efficiency of monetary policy is a crucial issue for any central bank."

I first provide empirical evidence that foreign banking penetration can be associated with a contraction of banking credit, especially in countries with poor credit markets. Second I present a model in which the presence or the absence of foreign lenders endogenously modifies firms credit constraints and hence the volume of credit extended in the economy. Specifically, I show on the one hand that foreign lenders consider loans from domestic lenders as firm collateral. This implies that their lending supply is positively associated with the volume of capital a firm is able to borrow from domestic lenders (collateral effect). On the other hand, the presence of foreign lenders raises competition, reduces domestic lenders profits and hence reduces domestic lenders capital supply (competition effect). Two different cases are then possible. If foreign lenders are able, in spite of the collateral effect, to extend a large volume of loans even when domestic lenders lending capacity has shrinked (due to increased competition on the capital market), then the economy benefits at the steady state both from a large capital supply and a low cost of capital. Integration then raises the economy's growth rate. On the contrary, if foreign lenders are not able, due to the collateral effect, to extend a large volume of loans when domestic lenders lending capacity has shrinked, then competition reduces domestic lenders lending capacity and the collateral effect prompts foreign lenders to reduce their capital supply. Integration then depresses the economy's growth rate, firms cost of capital and the volume of credit extended in the economy."

These factors highlight the role of national and international portfolio shifts in monetary developments. Furthermore, the traditional specifications of the money demand function sometimes yield unsatisfactory results: instability of short and long-term coefficients, relatively large differences between the estimated and actual value of monetary aggregates, and significant changes in the number of long-run relations. Hence the idea of constructing a money demand function that excludes the external counterpart of M3 or, alternatively, introducing financial asset prices in the demand function of M3, as suggested by Friedman (1988). First, the basic equation, based on the quantitative equation of money, was reestimated in order to verify, for example, whether extending the estimation period or revising certain variables would not result in a major change, notably in terms of the stability of the parameters or the number of structural relations. Indeed, this equation exhibits two instabilities (parameters and the number of long-run relations). Similar results are obtained when the external counterpart of M3 is not taken into account. However, by including European share prices, we obtain a substitution effect (significantly negative coefficient) of this variable and a better adjustment, without affecting the two long-run relations (money demand and the Fisher relation) discussed in the article published in Banque de France Monthly Digest No. 113. So, all other things being equal, a decline in European stock market yields would result in a rise in real money holdings and a decrease in the velocity of circulation of money. Equity market developments therefore appear to be a significant explanatory factor for the dynamics of M3 in the euro area. Lastly, estimates of the real money gap, based on the money demand equation factoring in the substitution effect associated with European stock price developments, point to moderate but persistent excess liquidity in the euro area."

Around one-third of firms follow mainly time-dependent pricing rules while two-thirds allow for elements of state-dependence. The majority of firms take into account past and expected economic developments in their pricing decisions. Price stickiness is mainly driven by customer relationships - explicit and implicit contracts - and coordination failure.

Wealth effects seem to have a fairly limited impact on loans to households. However, the balance sheet structure effect appears to be largely responsible for the expansion of loans to companies. The rise in stock prices in the latter half of the 1990s seems to have sharply increased companies' equity capital, thus allowing them to increase their leverage.

The forward-looking nature of this model is in this respect interesting on two accounts: first, it worsens the time-inconsistency problem of optimal monetary policy by adding a stabilization bias to the possible inflation bias; second, it enables us to model more satisfactorily the reputation of the central bank by accounting for the coordination of the private agents on the punishment length. Our results suggest that the inflation bias and the stabilization bias can be overcome for the calibrations used in the literature. These results enable us to endogenize Woodford's timeless perspective and weaken the case for monetary policy delegation."

We find that this model is not rejected by the data and is able to produce impulse responses in SVAR from simulated data similar to impulse responses in SVAR from actual data. Moreover, technology shocks represent the main contribution to the variance of the business cycle component of output under the estimated DSGE model.

Prices are found to adjust infrequently; the median firm modifies its price only once a year. Price reviews are more frequent than price changes; the median firm reviews its price quarterly. Firms are found to follow either time-dependent, state-dependent or both pricing rules. Moreover, the chosen interval of price reviews depends on the probability that changes in the firms' environment occur. Coordination failure and nominal contracts (either written or implicit) are the most important sources of price stickiness, while pricing thresholds and physical menu costs appear to be totally unimportant. Asymmetries in price stickiness are found to be different for cost shocks compared to demand shocks: prices are more rigid downward than upward for cost shocks, while the reverse is true for demand shocks."

Two instruments, pensions and child benefits, are necessary to decentralize the optimal state. Next, we compare the scenario depicted by the model with historical fact.

This paper addresses the question of whether differences in the price elasticity of demand for ICTs could explain why Europe lags behind the United States in terms of ICT diffusion. We use annual macroeconomic data covering the period 1975-2001 and consider five countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Europe's lag in ICT diffusion does not appear to be linked to cross-country differences in the price elasticity of demand for ICT products. Our results suggest that at least part of the gap in ICT diffusion should be ascribed to more structural cross-country differences. The estimated value of the price-elasticity of computer hardware and software is generally lower than -1 which, given the decline in the relative price of these products, explains the increase in their share of investment expenditure and GDP.

The Kalman filter simultaneously estimates two unobservable variables: the output gap and the natural rate of interest.

Consistent with the theoretical intuition, our identifying assumptions include a close relationship between the TVNRI and the low-frequency fluctuations of potential output growth. The resulting interest rate gap, that is, the difference between the real rate of interest and its estimated natural level, provides us with a valuable tool for assessing the monetary policy stance in EU12 over the last two decades. While our TVNRI estimate seems quite robust to changes in model specifications, the relatively high uncertainty surrounding the estimate hampers its direct integration into the policy-making process."

A strong heterogeneity across sectors both in the average duration of prices and in the pattern of price setting is reported. There is no clear evidence of downward nominal rigidity, since price cuts are almost as frequent as price rises. Moreover, the average size of a change in price is quite large in both cases.

The analysis is first based on annual data over a long period spanning the entire 20th century for the United States, France and the United Kingdom. Productivity trends are then studied over a shorter period, using quarterly data, for the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Japan and the Netherlands. There are already a large number of studies of this kind, but they are too often focused on presenting average productivity growth rates for given periods chosen on an ad hoc basis. In this article, we use a robust statistical method to endogenously identify possible breaks in per capita productivity trends. This method, developed by Bai and Perron (1998), brings out the following salient features: in the United States, per capita productivity growth accelerated following the trend break at the start of the 1920s, then slowed down at the end of the 1960s. This finding is in line with the Big Wave concept developed by Gordon (1999, 2002) to describe the trends in US productivity growth throughout the 20 th century. French and UK productivity started catching up with that in the United States around the end of the Second World War. Most of the countries under review recorded slower trend productivity growth in the first half of the 1970s. In the United States, this break occurred in 1966. This finding differs from that of other existing analyses, which point to 1974. Trend productivity growth in Europe and Japan slowed in the 1990s, whereas US productivity gained momentum over the same period."

Modern New Keynesian theory is an appropriate framework for analysing the impact that this anchoring of expectations has on the determination of the short- to medium-term inflation rate. From this point of view, observed inflation in the euro area seems to be in line with the theory and the ECB's action seems to be very effective. Thirdly, we will focus on the other aspect of monetary stability: the degree of price-level uncertainty and the anchoring of inflation expectations in the medium to long term. Even though this assessment is more difficult than it is in the short to medium term, since we only have a track record covering five years, various indicators from the theoretical analysis paint a fairly reassuring picture of the effectiveness of the device used by the ECB."

In contrast, under large departure from normality (as found in some stocks in mature markets or in some stock indices in emerging markets), the mean-variance criterion may fail to approximate the expected utility correctly. In such cases, the three-moment or four-moment optimization strategies may provide a good approximation of the expected utility."

Full homogeneity of the nominal side of the model ensures the independence between the nominal equilibrium and the real equilibrium, the latter being only determined in the long run by relative prices. Furthermore, as regards the specification of equations, special attention was paid to the consequences of changes in short-term interest rates."

The hybrid ""New Keynesian"" Phillips Curve is a prominent example. Estimates of such hybrid models have produced conflicting empirical results: Studies which use ML estimation tend to find the forward-looking component to be small, while those using GMM have reported the inflation dynamics to be predominantly forward-looking. This paper provides a rationalization for this empirical conflict. Allowing for two alternative and straightforward mis-specifications (measurement error and omitted dynamics) in a hybrid model, we show that the ML estimator tends to undervalue the weight of the forward-looking component, while the GMM estimator tends to overstate it. This result is shown to hold analytically in a simple DGP. Monte-Carlo experiments indicate that it remains valid in a wide range of more plausible DGPs. Simulations also suggest that the gap obtained between the two estimators in the context of the new Phillips curve can more readily be accounted for by mis-specification, than by the finite-sample biases."

However, regarding total HICP we do not produce forecasts that are totally satisfactory in the sense of being capable of recognizing the 1999-2000 upturn in inflation in a timely manner. But, from that point of view, the construction of a ''synthetic core'' indicator helps achieve significantly better forecasts over a 12-month horizon than the AR model for total inflation for the final part of the sample.

In the short to medium term, central banks should be cautious when identifying changing patterns in potential output growth, as temporary errors in appreciation may have an asymmetrical impact on economic stability: the production instability that could result from central banks mistakenly perceiving the advent of a NE would be greater than that generated by the failure to recognise a genuine rise in potential output growth."

Unlike in the US, the size of a bank does generally not explain its lending reaction. We also show that the standard publicly available database, BankScope, obscures the heterogeneity across banks. Indeed, for several types of questions BankScope data suggest very different answers than more complete data that reside at national central banks."

 """,2002.,Is There a Bank lending Channel in France? Evidence From Bank Panel Data,"92, Banque de France.","The aim of this paper is to check the possible existence of a bank lending channel in France. For that purpose, we have estimated a dynamic reduced form model allowing for asymmetries in loan supply across banks, depending on their size, liquidity and capitalization. We have used a panel of 312 French banks observed quarterly over the period 1993-2000. We find some asymmetry between liquid and illiquid banks, the latter being more sensitive to a monetary policy tightening. This result is in accordance with that obtained for several other countries of the Euro area. It constitutes an indication that, as far as they can, French banks sell part of their liquid assets in order to shield their loan portfolio from the effects of increases in the interest rate. Contrary to what has been found for the US (e.g., see Kashyap and Stein (1995, 2000) and Kishan and Opiela (2000)), we do not find the two other banks' characteristics we consider (size and capitalization) to have any significant impact on bank lending."

Supervising banks more often will alleviate this problem but will increase the costs of supervision. This paper analyzes the trade-offs that supervisors face between the cost of supervision and their need to monitor banks effectively. We first characterize the optimal supervisory policy, in terms of the time between examinations and the closure rule at examinations, and compare it with the policy of an independent supervisor. We then show that making this supervisor accountable for deposit insurance losses in general reduces the excessive forbearance of the independent supervisor and may also improve on the time between examinations. Finally, we extend our analysis to the impact of depositor-preference laws on supervisors' monitoring incentives and show that these laws may lead to conflicting effects on the time between examinations and closure policy vis-a-vis the social optimum."

Moments of market returns can be expected to be time varying as structural changes occur in nascent market economies. We develop an ad-hoc optimal asset-allocation strategy with a flavor of Bayesian learning adapted to these various characteristics. Since an extreme event often heralds a new state of the economy, we re-initialize learning when unlikely returns materialize. By considering a Cornell benchmark, we show the usefulness of our strategy for certain types of re-initializations. Our model can also be used in situations when new industries emerge or when companies are subject to important restructuring."

The final section proposes a structural method for estimating potential output, where business sector output is described by a Cobb-Douglas function, while that of the non-business sector is assumed to be exogenous. For this structural method, the NAIRU has to be calculated before estimating the short to medium-term level of potential output."

 """,2002.,Short-Run Assessment of French Economic Activity Using OPTIM,"88, Banque de France.","This paper describes a short-term projection model for French economic activity, OPTIM, the aim of which is twofold. First it gives an early estimate of real GDP growth for the previous quarter, when no figure has yet been released by Insee, the French National Statistical Institute, along with flash estimates for main GDP components (consumption, investment, inventories and external trade) together with a breakdown by sectors (services, manufacturing, construction, equipment, agri-food). This appears particularly useful for the short-run analysis. In this respect OPTIM may be considered as a traditional bridge equation model since it links a particular indicator available generally ahead of the release of the quarterly national accounts with a quarterly aggregate like GDP, consumption . Second, this tool supplies also estimates for GDP growth and its main components for the current quarter and for the next quarter (i.e two and three quarters respectively following the latest reference period of Insee's GDP data release). A pool of (mainly) monthly variables is used, which are, sometimes, directly introduced in the specification but, more often, summarised by the implementation of a principal component analysis (PCA). The largest part of the set of indicators comprises survey data together with monthly traditional indicators (industrial production, consumption in manufactured goods ). But other data (in particular financial data) are also introduced. The outcomes of OPTIM rely on a relatively complex procedure involving about twenty equations and mixing two alternative approaches: a supply approach consisting in a direct modelling of GDP and a demand approach where GDP is the sum of consumption, investment, changes in stocks and net trade (exports minus imports). The discrepancy between these two estimates is distributed according to an original method, yielding a unique GDP estimation. The paper is organised as follows. Section 1 presents the main features of OPTIM. Section 2 deals with data description while section 3 addresses the data assessment's issue. In section 4, the main equations are described. Section 5 presents a general assessment of OPTIM in terms of forecasting record. Finally section 6 concludes and proposes some avenues for further developments."

In this paper, we test whether European and US inflation dynamics can be described by this model. For this purpose, we estimate hybrid Phillips curves, which include both backward and forward-looking components, for major European countries, the euro area, and the US. Estimation is performed using the GMM technique as well as the ML approach. We examine the sensitivity of the results to the choice of output gap or marginal cost as the driving variable, and test the stability of the obtained specifications. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, in all countries, the NKPC has to be augmented by additional lags and leads of inflation, in contrast to the prediction of the core model. Second, the fraction of backward-looking price setters is large (in most cases, more than 50 percent), suggesting only limited differences between the US and the euro area. Finally, our preferred specification includes marginal cost in the case of the US and the UK, and output gap in the euro area."

However, an abundant econometric literature underlines the unappealing small-samples properties of GMM estimators. Focusing on the Federal Reserve reaction function, we assess GMM estimates in the context of monetary policy rules. First, we show that three usual alternative GMM estimators yield substantially different results. Then, we compare the GMM estimates with two Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimates, obtained using a small model of the economy. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the empirical results. We find that the GMM are biased in small sample, inducing an overestimate of the inflation parameter. The two-step GMM estimates are found to be rather close to the ML\ estimates. By contrast, iterative and continuous-updating GMM procedures produce more biased and more disperseDeestimators."

A variable is said to be causal for another in the long-run if knwoledge of the past of the former improves long-run predictions of the latter. In a VAR framework, we show that long-run non-causality can be easily tested with a Wald statistics, conditionally on the cointegration rank. The methodology is used to study long-run causal links between US, German, and French long-term interest rates from January 1990 to June 1997."

It explains the choices that modelers have to make at different stages of the procedure. An illustration is provided by an analysis of monetary policy shocks in France over the 1972 : 1-1995 : 2. Compared with previous studies of this country, the main finding is the statistically significant effect of monetary policy on economic activity and inflation. This is found by introducing an additional variable that measures budget policy. The article shows that "" structural "" VARs can be used to analyse the 1993 recession."

 """,1998.,"L'inflation sous-jacente à partir d'une approche structurelle des VAR : Une application à la France, l'Allemagne et au Royaume-Uni","51, Banque de France.","Central banks should dispose of a precise measure of the structural inflation, i.e. the inflation adjusted from the economic cycle. This component of inflation, also called core inflation, is deduced from a structural VAR. Economists agree upon the long-term neutrality of inflation on production. Imposing such a constraint on a structural VAR, including inflation and production, allows to disentangle the core and the cyclical components of inflation. The core inflation is obtained by canceling the cyclical component of inflation. Quah and Vahey(1995) use the identification method proposed by Blanchard and Quah(1989) to compute the core inflation in UK. We apply the same technique for France, Germany and UK. Moreover, the procyclical characteristic of short-term inflation is showed whereas, since 1993, inflation would be closer to its underlying level in Germany. Stronger nominal rigidity in Germany would explain such a fact."

As such, it could be attacked from a methodological point of view as relying excessively on that indicator and on a small number of hypothesis (although we have empirical arguments for each of these). We do consider that if each one of our hypothesis (and then our measures) may be discussed, the global picture we draw is the only one which puts all the available data in a consistent order. This picture is different from the prevailing one in some aspects concerning the Poincar stabilization, and reinforces one of the interpretations of the 1930s."

We consider a non-parametric method based on a mixture of log-normal densities, the semi-parametric ones based on an Hermite approximation of Madan and Milne, or based on an Edgeworth expansion of Jarrow and Rudd, the parametric approach of Malz which assumes a jump-diffusion for the underlying process, and eventually Heston's approach assuming a stochastic volatility model. We apply those models on FRF/DEM exchange rate options for two dates, for various maturities. Models differ when important news hit the market (here the 1997 snap elections). The non-parametric model provides a good fit to options prices but is unable under critical circumstances to provide as much information about market participants expectations than Malz's jump-diffusion model."

Constraints on the parameters of the restricted VAR lead us to prefer an indirect estimation based on the error-correction model. This approach is applied to euro-rates over the period 1975-96.

 """,1997.,La Théorie des anticipations de la structure par terme : test partir des titres publics fran ais,"45, Banque de France.",This paper focuses on the expectations hypothesis of the term structure on long-term government bonds. Standard tests (based on the relationships between the change in the long-term rate and the spread and between the change in the short-term rate and the spread) lead to a puzzle close to the one obtained by Campbell and Shiller (1991) using US data. An approach based on stationarity of excess returns and error-correction models gives more details on these results: the expectations hypothesis is widely accepted when holding return is considered whereas it is systematically rejected when rollover return is considered.

 """,1997.,Le contrat notionnel : efficience et causalit,"44, Banque de France.","The main topic of this paper is about the overall functionnning of the french futures bonds market. Three mains questions are asked: (1) Is the futures market inefficient? (2) Is there any free lunch between the future market and the spot market? (3) Does one of these markets play a leader role? Econometric tests give globally an negative answer to all these three questions. The arbitrage's opportunities which have been detected in the period 86.12-90.06 can be explained by the restrictions to sell-short bonds in the french cash market. The two tests on the rationality of the expectations which have been undertaken (a time series test and a panel data test) yield the same conclusion : one cannot reject the assumption that the market is efficient. Finally, tests of causality between the future market and the cash market on daily data shows strong instantaneous correlation between them. Concerning delayed causality, the future market have played a leader role during the period 90.01-93.06 during which one has observed an overall stability of the futures prices."

A data set has been constructed, which contains zero-coupon yield curves on government bonds over the period 1980-95. The information content is generally very weak over the whole period. On the contrary, over the period 1985-95, the term structure contains information for certain maturities. On the one hand, spreads vis- -vis 2-year rates are informative for future changes in short-term rates, whereas spreads vis-à-vis 3-year rates are informative for both future changes in short-term rates and future changes in long-term rates; on the second hand, the spreads from (2- versus 1-year rates) to (5- versus 1-year rates) and (4- versus 2-year rates) are the most informative for future changes in inflation rate."

The non-significance of expected volatility in return equation can be explained by the influence of trading volumes on returns. On the other hand, asymmetric effects (from non-expected return to volatility) are very high, especially for Dow Jones, DAX and Nikkei. International transmission mechanisms are very clear-cut for return equations (in particular, from Dow Jones to other stock market indices), but much more contrasted for volatility equations. The trading volumes have marked effects on all the markets, both in the return and in the volatility equations."
