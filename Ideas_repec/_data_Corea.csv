 """,2020.,Wage and Employment Effects of Immigration: Evidence from Korea,"2020-30, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","This paper studies the impact of immigration on native labor market outcomes in Korea. We exploit the variation in immigration flows in an education-experience cell and find that, on average, immigration has no harmful effect on the wages or employment of native workers. However, there is great heterogeneity in the wage effects across education groups: high school dropouts suffer from the adverse effects, whereas the effects for college graduates are positive. We find the potential explanation for these differential effects in the suggestive evidence on the degree of substitution. Specifically, we examine the similarity of occupational distribution between natives and immigrants. While the least-educated natives and immigrants have almost identical occupation distributions, highly educated natives are likely to work in different occupational segments from the corresponding immigrants."

 """,2020.,The Excess Sensitivity of Long-term Interest rates and Central Bank Credibility,"2020-29, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Long-term interest rates show considerable reactions to macroeconomic and monetary policy news. It is, however, difficult to be explained by standard rational expectations macro-finance models widely used in policy analyses. In this research, we demonstrate that private¡¯s subjective beliefs and central bank credibility can account for the excess sensitivity of long-term interest rates using an estimated macro-finance model which incorporates private¡¯s subjective perceptions on future real activity and inflation and endogenously evolving central bank credibility. We find that long-term rates respond stronger to macro shocks and shifts in private's perceptions regarding expected real activity and inflation when credibility is lower. In addition, the model simulation shows that 10-year yield varies substantially more when credibility is low."

The results suggest that there is a break on the consumption path at the time of a home purchase; non-durable consumption in the after-period of a home purchase is 5.2% higher than the before-period. The results propose an extra path that connects the two cycles of housing markets and consumption by suggesting that home purchases trigger not only additional home-related durable spendings, but also release delayed consumption."

 """,2020.,"Central Bank Digital Currency, Tax Evasion, Inflation Tax, and Central Bank Independence","2020-26, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Can introducing Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) improve social welfare? We construct a dual currency model to study whether introducing CBDC with a recordkeeping technology can reduce tax evasion incentives in cash transactions, and further achieve a better allocation than in a cash-only economy. Tax evasion does not occur in an economy only with an inflation tax. However, if imposing a positive sales tax is inevitable for central bank independence, there arises an inefficiency associated with tax evasion in cash transactions. Introducing CBDC with positive interest can reduce this inefficiency and thus improve welfare by discouraging tax evasion, and rewarding tax payments."

Using the synthetic control method, we estimate the conflict¡¯s impacts on Chinese tourists to Korea and stock prices of China-related Korean firms. We find that a negative effect on the inflow of tourists appeared with a lag of 3 months after the announcement of the decision and persisted for about 18 months. On the other hand, the impacts on the stock market appeared immediately, but insignificant and short-lived."

 """,2020.,Estimating Capital Stock in North Korea and Its Implications (in Korean),"2020-24, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","This study aims to estimate the capital stock in North Korea from 1955 to 2018, based on the perpetual inventory method, and then to explain its economic growth. The capital stock is estimated by decomposing it into construction assets and equipment assets. Estimates show that North Korea's capital stock increased rapidly from 1955 to 1989, then decreased significantly in the 1990s, and recovered since the 2000s. The capital stock estimate as of 2018 stands at 24% higher than that in 1989. The capital stock/GDP ratio as of 2018 is around 3.9 times, which is higher than 3.0, the ratio commonly observed in many advanced economies. The estimated share of equipment capital within total capital is only 8% as of 2018, which compares with the corresponding rate (32%) during the 1970-1990 period in South Korea. Growth accounting analysis shows that North Korea achieved a rapid input-led growth in the early stages of economic growth, but has since shown stagnant or sluggish growth, due mainly to a drop in total factor productivity. It suffered from the economic crisis in the 1990s, and after 2000 the low growth pattern was maintained as productivity continued to remain sluggish amid a lower input growth rate. Since 2017, the economic growth rate has plummeted due to a further drop in the input growth rate and a significant drop in productivity in the wake of sanctions. We believe that the negative GDP growth rate during the so-called ¡°Arduous March Period,¡± and the low growth seen in succeeding periods that has been characterized by idle capacity with a poverty trap, can be explained by a Harrod (1939)-Domar (1946) model based on the Leontief production function as outlined in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995). As North Korea's growth conditions have deteriorated significantly due to the embargo on capital goods, it is required to improve its system that promotes productivity, efficiency and creativity through innovation in the ownership structure and management of farms and enterprises. More favorable foreign relations and an active opening policy are also necessary to attract foreign investment and technology, which is essential for human and physical capital accumulation and the resulting economic growth. Despite the estimates of this study, efforts should continue to be made to compare the historical accumulation process of individual assets, to calculate deflators, and to enhance the accuracy of production data used in estimating economic growth. In particular, the capital stock estimates in this paper should be understood as preliminary figures, as it is linked to work to improve the estimation of North Korea's other macro statistics."

 """,2020.,Credit Market Frictions and Coessentiality of Money and Credit,"2020-23, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","We explore how credit market frictions matter for the coessentiality of money and credit. There are high-productivity and low-productivity borrowers. Limited commitment can yield a one-for-one credit limit in accordance with a borrower's productivity. An adverse selection problem caused by asymmetric information, however, makes lenders impose the credit limit of a low-productivity borrower on a high-productivity borrower. If productivities differ sufficiently between borrowers, a high-productivity borrower is credit-constrained and is willing to hold money to compensate for the deficiency of their credit limit, but a low-productivity borrower is not. This eventually implies the coessentiality of money and credit in the sense that the use of both improves the allocation from a social welfare perspective."

 """,2020.,Vulnerable Growth: A Revisit,"2020-22, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","This paper studies the distributional linkages between future economic performance and current conditions by means of a flexible quantile regression method. The examination of the linkages suggests that the conditional quantiles are nonlinear, which offers a new perspective on the conditional distribution. The nonlinearity causes countercyclical volatility to break down in both the right and left tails, the breakdown being associated with positive skewness in the short-term. As a corollary, in periods of recessions accompanied by a financial crisis, downside risks inherent in the distribution are smaller than we would think otherwise based on linear quantile regression."

 """,2020.,A Model of Satisficing Behaviour,"2020-21, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","We build a model of satisficing behaviour. We explicitly introduce the value the decision maker “expects” from an action, where this expectation is adaptively formed. This valuation of an action is differentiated from her satisficing level which is taken to be the value the agent “expects” from her outside option. If the valuation is higher than her satisficing level she continues with the current action, updating her valuation of the action. If she receives a low payoff and her valuation of the action falls below her satisficing level, she updates her satisficing level downward the valuation and explores an alternative action. And, she occasionally experiences shocks on her satisficing level and choice of action. We show that in individual decision problems, satisficing behaviour results in cautious, maximin choice. In games like the Prisoner’s Dilemma and Stag Hunt, they in the long run play either cooperative or defective outcomes and in a class of coordination games, they coordinate on Pareto optimal outcomes."

 """,2020.,Macroeconomic and Financial Market Analyses and Predictions through Deep Learning,"2020-18, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Since Hinton, Osindero, and Teh (2006) developed the fast learning algorithm, deep learning has been a set of powerful tools that has recently achieved impressive performance across a wide spectrum of industries as well as in academia. For the macroeconomic and financial variables, however, more elaborate approaches need to be taken due to the unique latent features of them. In this regards, we propose novel approaches to apply deep learning to the predictions of time series variables in those fields. Specifically, we suggest ensembles of neural networks and Bayesian learning to estimate the posterior distributions of the forecasting outcomes as the out-of-sample forecasts. Examples are provided with predictions of monthly custom clearance exports from Korea and daily Korean won-US dollar exchange rates. The prediction results show that deep learning approaches are prevail even with non-granular data sets which normally used for the conventional econometric models."

 """,2020.,Cross-border Trade Credit and Trade Flows During the Global Financial Crisis,"2020-14, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Cross-border trade credit is credit extended by exporters and importers and makes up a considerable share of the trade finance instruments used in global trade. We use quarterly data on cross-border trade credit recorded in the International Investment Position at the International Monetary Fund and examine its effects on trade flows during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Unlike previous studies, we find not only that the effects of trade credit are positive on average, but also that these effects are more pronounced during the crisis. Specifically, we find that the decrease in trade credit explains 8.9%-10.5% of the trade collapse during the crisis. In addition, we find that the effects of trade credit on trade flows are more pronounced during the crisis for countries with a low level of financial development in the pre-crisis period."

 """,2020.,House Prices and Household Consumption in Korea,"2020-11, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","We measure impact of real estate housing prices on household consumption and investigate channels in operation, making use of panel data from Korea. Our baseline finding is that households expand their consumption by 0.194 percentage points in response to a 1 percentage point increase in the real house price index. This result is driven to a larger extent by home-owning households rather than non home-owning households, and by falling prices rather than rising prices. In an attempt to find clues as to the operation of relevant channels, we further breakdown total households into subgroups based on multi-house ownership, ages of the householders, size of the housing unit, and borrowing constraints that the household may face. In examining these subgroups of homeowners, we find evidence consistent with the operation of the wealth effect channel, but we do not find evidence supporting the operation of the collateral effect channel. Estimates for non home-owning households are broadly consistent with the precautionary saving effect channel, but we also find results that might be interpreted as there being a discouragement effect channel for a subgroup of non home-owning households."

 """,2020.,Aggregate Productivity Growth and Firm Dynamics in Korean Manufacturing 2007-2017,"2020-9, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","We study aggregate productivity growth of the Korean manufacturing industry for the 2007-2017 period. We find that the nature of such growth was quite different for two measures of productivity. For labor productivity, most of growth comes from productivity changes among surviving firms. On the other hand, for TFP, most of the productivity growth comes from that of new entrants in recent years. Our work illustrates the different nature of two productivity measures in terms of their growth paths. We also show interesting industry dynamics for both productivity measures, as exiting firms contributed positively to aggregate productivity growth with increasing trends, which suggests that the market had gradually eliminated firms of lower productivity. Using the dynamic Olley and Pakes (1996) decomposition, we also find that for both productivity measures, a substantial productivity growth after the 2008 global financial crisis was due to market share reallocations between firms, but this between-firm contribution has somewhat slowed or been decreasing since then. Our industry sector level study also shows that there has been fundamentally different heterogeneous productivity growth patterns and components across manufacturing sectors. Finally, we find that the wage level also plays a role in moderating or as an accelerating factor for different productivity growth paths among surviving, entering, and exiting firms. We find that higher wage groups had disproportionately higher entry and exit rates, and that the contributions of these industry dynamics to aggregate productivity growth were largest for the highest wage group while the productivity growth from the between firm component was substantially higher for lower wage groups. Therefore, we find that not only a timely change in input and output, but also in the wage, is a necessary ingredient for the pace and magnitude of reallocation to be effective in aggregate productivity growth."

 """,2020.,Network-Based Measures of Systemic Risk in Korea,"2020-8, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","We estimate systemic risk in the Korean economy using the econometric measures of commonality and connectedness applied to stock returns. To assess potential systemic risk concerns arising from the high concentration of the economy in large business groups and a few export-oriented sectors, we perform three levels of estimation using individual stocks, business groups, and industry returns. Our results show that the measures perform well over our sample period by indicating heightened levels of commonality and interconnectedness during crisis periods. In out-of-sample tests, we show that the measures can predict future losses in the stock market during the crises. We also provide the recent readings of our measures, both at the market, chaebol, and industry levels. The measures indicate systemic risk is currently not a major concern in Korea, as they tend to be at the lowest level since 1998. Systemic risk within-chaebols or within-industries overall has not significantly increased in the recent sub-period. In contrast, commonality within the finance industry has not subsided, which we interpret as capturing the interconnectedness endemic to the finance industry, rather than indicating a heightened systemic risk within the banking sector."

We estimate latent common factors by applying an array of data dimensionality reduction methods to a large panel of monthly frequency time series data. We augment benchmark forecasting models with common factor estimates to formulate out-of-sample forecasts of the real exchange rate. Major findings are as follows. First, our factor models outperform conventional forecasting models when combined with factors from the US macroeconomic predictors. Second, our factor models perform well at longer horizons when American real activity factors are employed, whereas American nominal/financial market factors help improve short-run prediction accuracy. Third, models with global PLS factors from UIP fundamentals overall perform well, while PPP and RIRP factors play a limited role in forecasting."

Using this method, we find that a structural change in the trend and cycle in Korea occurred in 1993. To explain these, we estimate the parameters of the productivity process in Korea, using data on Solow residuals. Our estimates show that the relative importance of trend growth shocks in the post-break period increased by a factor of 2.56 compared to that in the pre-break period."

 """,2019.,"Uncertainty, Credit and Investment: Evidence from Firm-Bank Matched Data","2019-25, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","This paper studies how high uncertainty affects corporate bank loans, addressing the important identification issue. In times of high uncertainty, firms reduce their credit demand due to delayed investments or a deterioration in their credit worthiness, while at the same time banks are more exposed to negative shocks to their balance sheet and thereby reduce credit supply. To isolate the uncertainty effect from the credit supply effect, we employ matched bank-firm loan data covering all loans extended by all financial intermediaries to the universe of listed firms in Korea, a bank-centered economy. Our empirical results reveal that a failure to control for credit supply leads to overestimation of the negative effect of uncertainty on bank loans. In addition, we find that the negative effect is stronger for relatively larger firms or financially unconstrained firms with low leverage or financial slack, once credit supply is controlled for. We confirm the same results in the analysis of firm investment, suggesting that high uncertainty may transmit to investment and bank loans mainly through the real options effects."

 """,2019.,Impact of Chinese Renminbi on Korean Exports: Does Quality Matter?,"2019-24, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","This paper examines the impact of changes in the Chinese exchange rate on Korean exports taking into consideration the characteristics of the exported products. In this paper, we consider the degree of vertical product differentiation to be one of the causes that ease the negative spillover effects from the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi on Korea¡¯s export performance. Using import data from OECD member countries from 2002 to 2014, we find that Korea's exports to OECD countries of the products that have a greater degree of competition fall more as the renminbi depreciates. In addition, once quality differences between Korea and China are considered in the estimation, the negative impact from the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi turn out to be negligible. Due to a small response to the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi for a high quality good, the negative impact diminishes in the markets and the products where Korean goods show a relatively higher quality than those of China."

 """,2019.,Systemic Risk of the Consumer Credit Network across Financial Institutions,"2019-23, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","We investigate a network of financial institutions in Korea using the Korea Consumer Credit Panel (KCCP). The main contribution of this paper is that we construct the network of financial institution from the consumer credit level. We assume each consumer make a loan from multiple institutions so that those institutions share same risk from same consumer no matter of quality or type of loan. Then we construct the financial network between institutions and compute contagion index based on those multiple connection with a weight of default probability of individual borrowers. We found strong connection with banking institutions and credit card firms due to convenience in making small-amount loans with credit cards. However, when we give an weight with default probability to the linkage among institutions, connections of banking institution with savings bank, non-credit card finance corporation and merchant banking are stronger than others, while banking institution holds center position and has biggest amount of loans individually. Contagion index hit a peak in 2013Q1 and then fell rapidly, finally has been fluctuated in relatively low level from 2016 to 2017Q2. The result in our paper enables the authority to watch the systemic risk from consumer credit level with specific consumer type with their default probability."

 """,2019.,Identifying Government Spending Shocks and Multipliers in Korea,"2019-22, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Accurately estimating the government spending multiplier is important so that fiscal policies can be used appropriately when recessions hit the economy. To fill the gap between the frontier research of calculating the government spending multiplier and current Korean research, and to estimate a more accurate multiplier in Korea, we construct a government spending news series in Korea based on Fisher and Peters (2010) by exploiting a market-weighted sum of excess stock returns of military contractors in Korea. We then use this military spending news series and estimate a structural VAR model to evaluate the effects of government spending. As a result, GDP and government spending show statistically significant responses to military spending news shocks. The accumulated government spending multiplier peaks after four quarters, and the five-year cumulative multiplier is calculated as 1.27. For a robustness check, different types of VAR models are tested and results are qualitatively similar."

For this purpose, we propose the QCCRE(Quantile Canonical Cointegrating Regression Estimator). The QCCRE provides an estimation method for quantile regression with non-stationary time series data. The estimator is a solution to the Koenker and Bassetts (1978)¡¯s minimization problem, and its asymptotic distribution follows a mixed normal distribution. The estimation results show that disposible income has a positive effect which confirms previous research. Financial assets (stock price index) have a positive wealth effect, however, household¡¯s real assets (house price index) have a negative wealth effect which is different from previous research. Household debt has a positive effect on household consumption. However, the net effects of household debt may be smaller or even insignificant because household debt is sum of martgage loan and non-martgage loans that have opposite effects on household consumption."

The main findings are as follows: (i) the significant and negative relationship between mortgagors¡¯ interest payments and consumption comes from borrowers with ARMs (Adjustable-Rate Mortgages), (ii) among mortgagors with ARMs, those with low liquidity and credit accessibility show a high interest-induced MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume), (iii) the debt burdens of mortgagors have a weaker effect on the interest-induced MPC heterogeneity due to active deleveraging behavior of borrowers with a high debt burden, (iv) while unconstrained borrowers consistently show low and insignificant MPCs, constrained borrowers (those with low liquidity, credit accessibility) maintain long-lasting high MPCs for eight quarters after interest reduction, and (v) the MPC of those with low liquidity becomes lower as time goes by, indicating that windfall gains by mortgage interest reduction help to relax the liquidity constraints they face. These results imply that financial characteristics of mortgage borrowers can affect the magnitude and persistence of the cash flow channels of an expansionary monetary policy."

However, with the emergence of many countries such as China since then, this approach no longer seems reasonable. In line with this change to the global economic environment, there also have been changes in cross-country correlations: the output correlation between the U.S. and Europe has risen, and their consumption correlation has slightly fallen. Accordingly, this paper adds many countries to a standard model to show that doing so can capture the transition in the cross-country correlations. By analytical investigation, I first show that as the number of countries in a simple model increases, the output correlation rises and the consumption correlation falls. A quantitative analysis with a more general model also shows that when the model has more countries, it yields a higher output correlation and a smaller consumption correlation."

In contrast with existing literature, this paper regards skilled workers as overhead labour, and presents a model wherein skilled workers constitute a fixed input, required to produce a new product. The demand for skill increases with product variety, and information technology is skill-biased because it raises product variety by lowering the fixed cost of product creation. However, skill-biased change does not necessarily raise measured productivity because product diversification reallocates resources into fixed inputs, which is consistent with the historical fact that skill-biased change did not always accompany productivity growth."

In particular, controlling for the existing geographic distribution of knowledge production, the frequency of domestic citations of Korean patents is no more than the citation frequency from overseas. We also examine localization effects across regions and industries. Our findings suggest a potential role for government policy aimed at promotion of positive innovation externalities within the Korean economy."

Intra-firm trade refers to the cross-border flow of goods between related parties, and arm¡¯s length trade refers to the cross-border flow of goods between unrelated parties. Using firm-level data from the Korean manufacturing sector from 2006 to 2009, we employ two approaches that complement each other, accounting decomposition and fixed effects regression analyses. Our accounting decomposition result reveals that aggregate-level intra-firm trade is more responsive to shocks during the global financial crisis compared to arm¡¯s length trade, particularly in durable goods industries. The decline in intra-firm trade during the crisis is largely driven by extensive margins while the changes in arm¡¯s length and total trade are largely driven by intensive margins. The fixed effects panel regression results show that firms¡¯ involvement in the global value chain is the most significant determinant for the decline in a firm¡¯s trade growth during the crisis, where the negative effect is stronger for arm¡¯s length trade than for intra-firm trade, and is more pronounced in durable goods industries than in non-durable goods industries."

We quantify the tones of 24,079 news articles around 152 dates of Monetary Policy Board (MPB) meetings of the Bank of Korea (BOK) from March 2005 to November 2017. We then measure monetary policy surprises using the changes of those tones following monetary policy announcements and estimate the impact of monetary policy surprises on asset prices. Our measure of monetary policy surprises better explains changes in long-term rates, while changes in the Bank of Korea's base rate are more closely associated with changes in short-term rates (maturity of one year less). Our results strongly suggest that using a text mining approach to measure monetary policy surprises sheds light on information related to forward guidance and market expectations on future monetary policy."

By applying an overlapping generations model with random-relocation shocks, the effects of securitization are analyzed in three different hypothetical situations: 1. only one region of the economy issues securities, 2. all regions issue securities with the same capital productivity, and 3. all regions issue securities, but capital productivity is disparate across regions. Asset securitization plays a role in supplying alternative liquid assets (fiat money). As the economy can invest its resources more efficiently in high-yielding illiquid assets (capital) due to securitization, both consumption and welfare increase overall. Optimal monetary policy follows the Friedman rule in cases 1. and 2. However, the rule does not apply in case 3."

We find that, in the event of cost shocks, the asymmetric responses of borrowing households without and saving households with dividend incomes lead to different labor supplies and consumptions over heterogeneous households, and eventually to an extension of monetary policy transmission channels. The income effect and low elasticity of labor supply play key roles for such asymmetric responses over heterogeneous households. We also find that the social welfare in flexible inflation targeting (FIT) monetary policy, in which both the inflation gap and output gap are considered in an integrated way for policy-making, is similar to that of Ramsey optimal monetary policy (ROP), in which the shares of debt-constrained households as well as all economic states including both the inflation gap and output gap are considered comprehensively for policy-making, and greater than that of simple inflation targeting (SIT) monetary policy, in which only the inflation gap is considered mechanically for policy-making. Such social welfare implies that FIT policy may still work well even in an economy with a sizable number of debt-constrained households. Further, the responses of cost shocks to consumption and labor supply are dying out more slowly in FIT and ROP policies than in SIT policy."

This paper introduces the results of recent studies into the government¡¯s industrial policies. It examines the mechanisms that enable the supply of sufficient funds for the development of innovative technologies through a theoretical model, and then draws policy implications. Extending loans to innovative industries is likely to result in insufficient lending to emerging innovators. This is due to poaching externality that focuses on entrepreneurs with good repayment histories of existing loans. There may be an equilibrium where funding to the innovative industries cannot be achieved at all. This implies that if private financial institutions only play a role of supplying funds to innovative companies, a smooth supply of funds to innovative companies may not be attained. Therefore, the government needs to implement industrial policies to facilitate investment in innovative industries."

The risk-taking is proxied by the risk weight of a bank, derived from its BIS capital ratio. We show that in Korea, an interest rate increase (decrease) make a bank bear less (more) risk. The risk-taking of a bank more profitable is less sensitive to an interest rate change. In addition, the asset structure, such as ratio of loan to total asset and ratio of short-term asset to total asset, of a bank adopting internal ratings based approach for its asset risk assessment, has more impact on bank¡¯s risk-taking than one with standardized approach. This paper is the first attempt to use the risk weight of a bank under capital regulation to analyze the relation between an interest rate change and bank¡¯s risk-taking. It thus contributes to the literature by the use of direct measure for risk-taking of a bank and by showing the interaction between monetary policy and macroprudential policy."

 """,2019.,Central Bank Digital Currency and Financial Stability,"2019-6, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","We examine the implications of central bank digital currency (CBDC) for financial stability using a monetary general equilibrium model in which (i) banks provide liquidity in the form of fiat currency, and (ii) commercial bank deposits compete with the central bank deposits in CBDC account. CBDC is a national currency-denominated, interest-bearing and account-based claim on the central bank. People have access to CBDC via direct deposit at the central bank. Claims on specific agents cannot be traded across locations due to limited communication and hence in the event of relocation an agent needs to withdraw deposits in the form of universally verified paper currency. Claims on interest-bearing CBDC is not subject to limited communication problem in the sense that it is also universally verified across locations as an account-based legal tender. The introduction of deposits in CBDC account essentially decreases supply of private credit by commercial banks, which raises the nominal interest rate and hence lowers a commercial bank's reserve-deposit ratio. This has negative effects on financial stability by increasing the likelihood of bank panic in which commercial banks are short of cash reserves to pay out to depositors. However, once the central bank can lend all the deposits in CBDC account to commercial banks, an increase in the quantity of CBDC which does not require reserve holdings can enhance financial stability by essentially increasing supply of private credit and hence lowering nominal interest rate."

Higher aggregate and idiosyncratic productivity volatility induce firms, which are constrained by information capacity, to allocate more attention to productivities and less to the monetary policy shock. This makes firms under-react to monetary policy actions, which increases real effects of monetary policy shocks. A threshold vector autoregression, which incorporates instrumental variables to identify the monetary policy shock, finds that monetary policy shocks have stronger impacts on output when uncertainty, as measured by VIX, is high."

Quantifying trend growth shocks, I find that persistent fluctuations in trend growth are the key driver of sizable long-run consumption risk. I compare this result to two conventional assumptions on a productivity process: 1) a deterministic trend with a cycle and 2) a random walk with drift. Persistent trend growth shocks generate larger long-run consumption risk than both highly persistent cycle shocks and random walk shocks. As a result, agents in the face of the trend growth shocks tend to save more and demand a higher equity premium. In addition, fluctuations in aggregate productivity growth is largely attributable to movements in trend growth."

We estimate the relationship between a country¡¯s mode of integration into global value chains, represented by global value chain participation and position indices, and its share in world¡¯s total value added at the aggregate and sectoral levels. We use OECD-WTO Trade in Value Added data of 61 countries over the period between 2000 and 2011. Based on the estimation results, we find that the extent of their upstream and downstream activities within global value chains is one of the key determinants of countries¡¯ export performance in value added terms. At the aggregate level, countries located upstream are associated with a higher share in total valued added. At the sectoral level, the positive effect of participating in global value chains thorough upstream activities on the share in total value added is apparent in the automotive industry, whereas the benefits of downstream activities are pronounced in the electrical and optical industry. Countries are expected to reap benefits from linking into global value chains either through forward or backward linkages in the textiles and foods industry. Thus, the effects of the mode of integration into global value chains on the share in total value added are found to be heterogeneous across industries."

By analyzing the KOSPI 200 options intraday data, we find that the abnormal implied volatility significantly increases around announcements of macroeconomic news and that the extent of the response is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of macroeconomic indicators released, option type and economic conditions. Specifically, the increase in implied volatility around these announcements is more pronounced for puts than for calls. These effects are also more pronounced in the crisis and post-crisis periods than in the pre-crisis period. Monetary policy announcements have a more substantial impact on implied volatility than other announcements, even after controlling for news surprise components. Finally, the impact appears to be greater for policy rate hikes than for policy rate cuts."

The country is projected to enter into the status of an aged society from 2018, with a share of the elderly in its population of 14.3%, and to become a super-aged society with a share of 20% in 2025. Population aging, characterized by low fertility rates and growing life expectancy, influences the whole economy: it alters macroeconomic variables such as output growth, consumption, the current account and inflation as well as household finance, the housing and labor markets, and the industrial structure. It also causes significant changes in the fiscal and monetary policy environment. It is therefore important to assess the impact of aging from a broad, long-term perspective, so as to prepare for it in advance. The Korean government set the low fertility rate and population aging as items on its national agenda back in 2004, and since 2006 has pursued three five-year plans to tackle these issues, albeit without visible results. Given that it takes at least a generation's time to see the effects of a population policy, failing to identify and address the current shortcomings could lead to irreversible consequences later. Against this backdrop, the Bank of Korea has been conducting broad research to analyze the situation related to population aging and devise appropriate policies in response. Under the overarching title Population Aging: Impacts and Policy Imperatives, this volume contains 15 papers, including an assessment of the macro and long-run impacts of population aging, case studies of other countries, and evaluations of and suggestions for the policies as well as the governance framework in Korea. Following this introduction in Part 1, Part 2 provides an overview of how population aging is unfolding in Korea, after which Part 3 undertakes a comprehensive evaluation of the macroeconomic implications of population aging. Part 4 then looks into the impacts of population aging on the various economic sectors, and the related policy challenges. Lastly, Part 5 provides the economic outlook for Korea as population aging progresses, and suggests policy imperatives."

The model produces international business cycle statistics that are closer to the data than a standard model. In particular, the output correlation between the two countries increases and the consumption correlation falls compared to the standard model. Notably, unlike standard models, this model yields an output correlation that exceeds the consumption correlation, which mitigates the ¡°quantity anomaly¡± that was previously noted in the literature.

After estimating a behavioral equation for international capital flows, we find that tightening monetary policy shocks cause international capital inflows to increase by raising the returns on investment, and that easing monetary policy shocks also lead to increased inflows of international capital by affecting investors¡¯ expectations of future economic conditions. We also find that the effects of monetary policy on international capital flows are not large during periods of low interest rates, and that in the low interest rate conditions since the global financial crisis its effects have weakened. This implies that, as the level of the Base Rate is increased in the future, the policy effects on international capital flows could be strengthened. The contribution of this paper is that, using our behavioral equation for international capital flows, we decompose the direct and indirect effects of monetary policy and check the nonlinear channel of monetary policy transmission to international capital flows. Although there are methodological limits in estimating the behavioral equation, the finding that monetary policy has statistically significant nonlinear effects on international capital flows implies that the monetary policy analysis should closely consider nonlinear effects as well."

This measure arises mainly due to the existence of the drifts in private long-term predictions, which are different from those of the central bank. It is shown that central bank credibility matters for macroeconomic stability. As the credibility increases, macroeconomic variables vary less. This generates endogenous volatility changes. Lastly, the magnitude of response of inflation to monetary policy depends on the level of credibility. This suggests that ignoring credibility changes might leads to overestimate of the cost of disinflation."

They are significant factors for private bank capital, however only for short-term interest rates, which takes up ignorable amounts in total capital balances. The most impressive factor is the foreign currency reserves owned by major central banks; these are particularly influential to capital flows throughout the sectors. Global and local risk indicators can also explain the variation of capital flows by sector. The underlying reasons behind these findings are as follows: changes in the proportions of sectoral capital balances after the global financial crisis, introduction of regulations on leverage ratios for international banks, risk management by investors, and increasing flows from foreign currency reserves of major central banks."

After first showing empirically that the shocks have stronger effects on commodity exporters than on importers, I then augment a standard three-country model to include commodities. Consistent with the empirical evidence, the model indicates that an expansionary monetary policy shock to the U.S. increases the aggregate output of commodity exporters by more than that of importers. This is because the increased U.S. aggregate demand triggered by the shock leads to greater U.S. demand for commodities and higher real commodity prices, and thus the exports of commodity exporters increase relative to those of commodity importers. Furthermore, I show that if commodity exporters¡¯ currencies are pegged to the U.S. dollar, then the U.S. monetary policy shocks have stronger spillovers to commodity exporters and importers. In the event that the U.S. becomes a net energy exporter, the shocks will have weaker effects on commodity exporters and stronger impacts on importers."

However, on the qualitative aspects, MWI could have positive effects by enhancing firm productivity and crowding out marginal firms in the market. These positive effects of MWI can offset, to some extent, its potential negative effects ? the increase of labor cost and the decrease of employment among others. In this regard we empirically examine the impact of MWI on the firm productivity (total factor productivity). Using firm level panel data in the manufacturing industry of Korea, we calculate the influence rates of minimum wage by sector and by size (number of workers) and analyze their effect on the firm productivity. In particular the production functions of the firms are estimated by the way of taking into account endogeneity among input factors, in order to resolve the drawbacks of existing studies ? underestimating capital factor coefficient and overestimating labor factor coefficient. This study finds that the influences of MWI on wage, employment, and productivity differ across sectors and firm sizes. While MWI has shown positive influences on the productivity growth in the manufacturing industry as a whole, each sector demonstrates different direction of effect and the degree of productivity change is also varying by sector. The impacts of MWI on the firm productivity are estimated generally to be more negative for smaller firms but for some sectors the effects are found to be positive. In addition, the wage increases resulted from MWI seem to cause productivity enhancement throughout all sectors in the manufacturing industry. The policy implications of this study are as follows. Considering the empirical finding that MWI causes the increases of productivity in many sectors of the manufacturing industry, it will be desirable to evaluate not only the negative side effects but also the positive effects of MWI for designing future minimum wage policy. Moreover, in spite of the uniform minimum wage, this study finds that the diverse influence rates of minimum wage across firms have differential impacts on wage, employment, and productivity across sectors or different sizes of establishment. This finding could be conducive to discussing about the differentiation of minimum wage scheme by sector or by size."

Although the impacts have been minimal, it is likely that the impact for this time turns out to be different from the previous cases, given the recent drastic minimum wage hike. Our study is meaningful in that we investigate empiric relationship between minimum wage and employment structure by using the data and analysis methodology differentiated from the existing research in circumstances where there is mounting concern as to the impact of rapid icreases in the minimum wage."

This paper also finds that a decline in the youth population, especially among people in their 20s, does not help to address the issue of youth unemployment. Secondly, this paper explains the additional factors behind Korea¡¯s higher youth unemployment rates. One is Korea¡¯s disadvantageous employment environment, compared to that in Japan, in terms of wage earning. Other factors include the existence of fewer decent corporate jobs than in Japan, and wide disparities in wages between large and small corporate jobs.

Although the results slightly differ depending on the estimation method, we find that an increase in the share of permanent workers has the greatest effect in increasing productivity growth. More specifically, productivity growth is significantly slowed by the use of temporary instead of permanent workers, whereas there is little difference in productivity growth when replacing permanent with self-employed workers. This result suggests that an increase in the use of temporary workers could have an adverse effect on labor productivity."

According to our estimated results, high-productivity firms show positive and statistically significant effects of exports on the labor demand while low-productivity firms have no statistically significant effects. Furthermore, our results show that offshoring activities mitigate the positive effects of exports on employment because tasks insid the firms should be relocated to the abroad. On the other hand, as imports increase, labor demand decreases since labor force is replaced by low-priced imported inputs. Also, firms participating in the global outsourcing mitigate the negative effect of imports since those firms achieved advanced-level of efficiency in the process of production through offshoring and expand their production. Therefore, it is important to consider heterogeneous firm productivity as well as offshoring activities in analyzing the effects of trade on labor demand at the firm level."

In addition, the proportion of non-regular workers and the proportion of workers employed in small enterprises are high among wage workers. In light of the characteristics of employment in Korea, the urgent problem of employment structure can be summarized by the deepening dual structure of the labor market, the increase of youth unemployment, the sluggish female employment, and the excessive share of self-employment.

The main results are as follows. First, among the factors considered, the one that shows the biggest effects on size-wage premium is worker characteristics. In particular, the differences in the years of schooling and work experience between workers of small and larger establishments play critical roles in explaining size-wage premium. Secondly, among variables for worker composition, the differences in shares of highly educated workers and workers who join labor unions within establishments mainly account for size-wage premium. Thirdly, wage differentials between contractors and subcontractors also affect size-wage premium in the manufacturing sector. This is due to relatively high shares belonging to subcontractors among small firms and lower wages paid to workers of subcontractors. Fourthly, low performance pay and inactive rent-sharing behaviors of small manufacturing firms make size-wage premium larger. Lastly, size-wage premium affects workers¡¯ wages disproportionately according to wage levels: High-wage workers in large firms benefit more from their size-wage premiums compared to low-wage workers working for the same firms."

First, long-term housing demand is estimated based on the Mankiw-Weil model. We then calculate the demographics-driven aggregate housing demand in North Korea, by estimating individuals¡¯ demands for housing using age-based survey data on North Korean defectors, and applying it in view of the age structure of North Korea¡¯s population. According to these estimates, the pace of increase in demographics-driven housing demand shows a gradual slowdown, from an annual average of 0.6% to 0.9% between 2001 and 2020, to 0.3% between 2021 and 2030. This paper next forecasts housing demand and the scale of housing construction in North Korea based on the assumption that the country will pursue external openness on full scale from 2021, and that this will lead to considerable growth in income. If external openness leads to a declining mortality rate and increases in individual demand, then an additional 0.6%p (for the low growth scenario) to 1.8%p (for the high growth scenario) in the annual rate of growth in total housing demand is likely, compared to the baseline scenario. The related housing construction investment is anticipated to show additional increases of 12.3 million pyeong (1 pyeong ¡Ö 3.3§³) (low growth scenario) to 34.1 million pyeong (high growth scenario) in terms of area, and of 28 trillion won (low growth) to 77 trillion won (high growth) in terms of amount during the 10 years from 2021.

By using Korean labor market data between 2000 and 2014, we estimate key parameters of the production function by utilizing industry variation observed in the data. Our findings robustly indicate that the elasticity of substitution is greater (or at least not smaller) for young workers than for elder workers. This finding is robust to instrumental variable regression and to different sub-groups of workers, including educational attainment, different criteria for young/prime-aged workers, male workers, occupational groups, and size of the firms.

Our estimation results reveal asymmetries in the short-run relationships of Korea¡¯s exports to global GDP and to the exchange rate, between the contractionary and the expansionary export regimes, although their long-run relationships remain stable. Specifically, the positive effect of real global GDP on Korea¡¯s real exports is inelastic during contractionary regimes but changes to become elastic in expansionary regimes. The effect of the real effective exchange rate on Korea¡¯s real exports is positive and inelastic under contractionary regimes, but becomes negative and elastic under expansionary regimes. Our results suggest that the asymmetric properties of the relationship of Korea¡¯s exports to global GDP and the exchange rates across the different regimes should be taken into account in order to better understand the behavior of Korea¡¯s exports."

A novel finding of this paper is that the responses of AEs and EMEs are asymmetric: AEs react more strongly to US policy uncertainty shocks while EMEs are more sensitive to risk aversion shocks. These results suggest that the channels through which each shock is transmitted to SOEs may vary."

We calculate Gini coefficient for various income range using data from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey and then estimate a block-exogeneity VAR representing Korean and US economies to examine the effects of monetary policies on income inequality. The results show that following a one-standard deviation contractionary (expansionary) monetary policy shock, market income Gini coefficient increases (decreases) significantly after one year, reaching its peak to 0.0014 (0.14%p) while GDP and CPI decrease (increase) significantly by 0.48% and 0.15%, respectively. The contributions of monetary policy shocks to income inequality are found to be small as shown by forecast error variance and historical decompositions. In addition, earnings heterogeneity channel is most important among various channels through which monetary policy affects income inequality. Finally, a counterfactual analysis implies that if Bank of Korea held the call rate constant at 5.13% from 2008:Q3 and thereafter, the average of market income Gini coefficient would be higher by 0.009 (0.9%p) during 2008:Q4 - 2015:Q1 under the assumption of static expectations."

We investigate the sources of this recent decline using two complementary methodologies, an accounting decomposition and a model-based decomposition. First, we decompose the changes in Korea's exports to China as a share of output into within-industry and between-industry effects using disaggregated industry-level data. Our results show that during the high export growth period of 1990-2009, the within effect dominated; in the export slowdown period of 2010-2014, the within effect contributed to the slowdown in that individual sectors, on net, exported a smaller fraction of their output to China. Second, we apply a dynamic multi-sector, multi-country general equilibrium model to decompose the shocks that cause the decline in Korea's exports to China. The results reveal that in 2013-2016 China experienced a sharp reduction in its desire to accumulate capital and to consume manufactured goods. All else equal, these forces would imply fewer imports by China from Korea of manufactured goods. Given that Korea's exports to China are highly concentrated in manufactured intermediate and capital goods, these shocks could, in principle, explain most of the decline in Korea's exports to China during this period."

I find that foreign branches reduce borrowing from their headquarters by 2.4% of their assets after a one percentage point hike in the home-country policy rates. The effect is more significant for the branches with higher loan-to-asset ratios as their asset maturities are longer. Korea introduced leverage caps on banks' FX derivative positions in 2010, and has been adjusting the cap depending on the macroeconomic situation. I find that lowering the cap makes foreign branches increase capital by receiving long-term capital from headquarters. The branches with higher bond-to-asset ratios respond more as they trade heavily in FX derivatives."

As a measure of import demand, we use import intensity-adjusted demand to take into account heterogenous import intensities across components of aggregate demand. Our estimation of a dynamic panel regression model reveals that Korea¡¯s exports to G7 countries were elastic with respect to the import demand of these countries until the period of the global financial crisis, but have shifted to become inelastic since the crisis. Furthermore, we separately estimate the effects of the different components of G7 countries¡¯ aggregate demand (private consumption, public consumption, investment and exports). The results show that the decrease in private consumption in G7 countries during the crisis had a significant impact in causing the decline in Korea¡¯s exports to them, but that the increase in their public consumption since the crisis has had a significant effect in driving the increased Korean exports to them. The effects of G7 countries¡¯ exports on Korea¡¯s exports to them remain positive and significant during both the pre- and the post-crisis periods. The effects of G7 countries¡¯ investment on Korea¡¯s exports are also positive and significant, but the positive effect has weakened since the crisis.

To build on previous studies, we provide an alternative definition of HtM households and examine the asymmetric effects of the direction of income changes on MPCs. By using the methodology of Hansen (2000), we estimate the threshold of the liquidity ratio (defined as liquid assets to monthly after-tax income) and find that households with liquid assets less than about two months of after-tax income show higher MPCs than others. We also find that the leverage ratio and newly defined HtM status show asymmetric effects on MPCs by the direction of income changes. The MPC of households with positive income changes is smaller than that of those with negative ones. Furthermore, HtM households with high leverage are much more sensitive to negative income changes than positive ones. This result suggests that in economic circumstances where households are highly in debt and have insufficient liquid assets, as in the South Korea economy, their consumption is likely to be vulnerable to negative income changes and this could hamper aggregate spending growth."

 """,2018.,Fixed-Rate Loans and the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy,"2018-20, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Fixed-rate loans may contribute to financial stability because they lower the volatility of interest rates. This reduced volatility of interest rates, however, may undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy. Fixed-rate loans, also, may change the steady-states of economy because fixed interest rates are usually higher than variable interest rates, which can alter incentives of borrowers for loans. This paper tests how fixed-rate loans affect the steady-states of economy and the effectiveness of monetary policy, using the DSGE model. The steady-states in the economy are shown to vary in the ratio of fixed-rate loans. When the ratio of fixed-rate loans rises, borrowers bear more burden of interests because fixed interest rates are higher than variable interest rates. Therefore, borrowers reduce their loans, which lead into decreased weight of financial sector in the economy. Total output, however, remains almost unchanged regardless of the ratio of fixed-rate loans because households increase labor supply to compensate for their financial losses. The similar phenomenon happens when the mark-up of fixed interest rates over variable interest rates increases. Effects of fixed-rate loans on monetary policy turn out to be different in financial economy and real economy. Financial economy variables, such as interest rates and loans, respond differently to monetary policy shocks when the ratio of fixed-rate loans increases. These differences, however, are offset by each other within financial economy and not transmitted to real economy. That is, real economy variables, such as output, consumption, and price, react virtually the same to monetary policy shocks regardless of the ratio of fixed-rate loans. The same results occur when I vary the mark-up of fixed interest rates or the stickiness of fixed interest rates."

This moral hazard incentive requires the more government bonds for the issuers to provide the same amount of money. In general equilibrium the individual money issuers do not internalize the aggregate effect of money supply. Thus the equilibrium allocation is constrained inefficient with the moral hazard incentives. We suggest a pigouvian tax on money supply to correct the externality in aggregate money supply.

Figuratively speaking, banks die (go bankrupt) singing a swan song (revealing hidden information). In this way bank runs help uninformed agents to achieve efficient allocation under the condition of asymmetric information in the financial markets. The production of information is done efficiently without cost a point which distinguishes between this paper from most other related studies. The efficiently bank runs provide new ground for the coexistence of banks and financial markets. Even when all agents deposit their whole endowment of goods with the bank, the markets play their role in allocating resources once efficient bank runs happen. Allowing a run implies that investment in liquidity can be minimized, and the expected utility of uninformed agents thus increased. The role of banks is strengthened when agents have limited access to the markets."

This paper finds that CB reputation is a significant determinant of inflation: the results of an FE panel and Arellano-Bond difference GMM model show that high-reputation CBs have achieved better inflation performances over the past 20 years with lower levels of inflation than others, holding the output gap and unemployment rate constant. This result remains robust to various control variables including money growth, past inflation levels, exchange rates, and financial crisis dummies. This paper also finds that high CB reputation is associated with a tight anchoring of inflation expectations to inflation targets in inflation-targeting countries. The effects of reputation on the volatility of inflation and unemployment rates are found to be not robust. This paper offers evidence of the opposite-direction causality as well that goes from high inflation to decreased CB reputation."

North Korea's external openness seems to have considerably increased, but it still faces difficulties in expanding its external openness due to economic sanctions by the international community. This study uses Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Claire's model (ACR model), which measures the economic welfare effects of various international trade models. In the ACR model, the ""import penetration ratio,"" which is the ratio of imports to domestic demand, indicates the degree of external openness, and ""gains from trade"" is a measure of the real income growth rate that occurs when switching from a closed to an open economy. We estimated the import penetration rate and gains from trade of North Korea during 1996-2016 using North Korean foreign trade data from UN Comtrade, IMF DOTS and KOTRA as well as inter-Korean trade data from the Unification Ministry of Korea. The main results of this study are as follows. North Korea's import penetration rate has shown a gradual increase, indicating an expansion of international openness. This trend has become especially clear since 2000 when the North Korean economy began stabilizing after the end of â€œthe Hardship March,â€ although it faltered slightly from 2014 to 2016.

The results of our panel analyses reveal a significantly higher number of delinquencies and defaults by North Korean defectors compared to the South Korean control group. Subsequent analysis of the credit management determinants also indicates significant differences between the two groups. While the number of delinquencies by North Korean defectors falls more rapidly than that in the control group as their credit histories lengthen, the number of defaults, which are long-term delinquencies, increases more rapidly. This implies that defectors' credit management capacities are improving as they accumulate financial experience, but that their resilience can be weaker in conditions of heavy debt. While the number of delinquencies in the control group does not differ by gender, the North Korean male defectors, who because of their long-term mandatory military service are expected to lack experience in informal economic activities compared to the female defectors, show a significantly higher number of delinquencies. These findings suggest that the lack of financial knowledge stemming from prolonged residence in a socialist society has a negative impact on defectorsâ€™ financial adaptation in South Korea. Therefore, in order to increase the degree of financial inclusion for North Korean defectors, additional support, such as financial education, should be considered."

Thus, if the hypothesis holds, the volatility of production would be lower than that of demand. However, the production smoothing hypothesis is inconsistent with the empirical regularity that the variability of production is not small compared to that of demand but rather large. To examine the determinants of inventory investment, we conducted a micro-dynamic analysis using the micro-level corporate panel data. The inventory changes induced by the production smoothing hypothesis cannot be supported by the result, while stock-out avoidance behavior is significant. Also, we found that inventory investments have close relationships with corporate profits or cash flows that are strongly pro-cyclical. In the macro-dynamic analysis, we derived two long-run equilibria from the relationship between inventories and sales, and between output and sales. Having analyzed the dynamic properties of inventory investments, we found that the dynamics are dependent on business cycles. During booms, the volatility of inventory investments is amplified due to stock-out avoidance motive, while production smoothing is insignificant. In contrast, during recessions, the non-convexity of production costs amplifies the volatility of inventories, while stock-out avoidance motive is insignificant. We found that the accuracy of business cycle forecasting could be improved by utilizing the dependence of inventory investment dynamics on the business cycle."

Using comprehensive Korean worker-level data, I first show that wage betweeninequality at the industry-size level has substantially contributed to a growing wage inequality trend since 1994 even after controlling for observed andunobserved worker characteristics and factoring in sorting effects; this phenomenon is dominated by the employer size-wage effect. The size-wage effect is mainly due to the differences in performance pay between employer sizes, while the effects of performance pay on within-inequality are limited. I then show the sources of the rising wage between-inequality in terms of firm-side factors using firm-level balance sheet data merged with worker-level data at the industry-size-year level. I find that changes in the estimated rentsharing parameters and the prices of capital-to-labor ratio are the main factors in the increasing dispersal of between-inequality and that they became more positively correlated with wages between 2009 and 2015 than they were before 2009. This positive correlation is observed even more clearly when performance pay is included in wages. These findings show that employers exhibit rent-sharing behavior and compensate for capital dependency using performance pay, and differentials of performance pay among employers are translated into increased between-inequality of wages."

We consider all (over 5 million) utility patents granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) over the period of 1976-2015. In analysis, we find the continued dominance of US, the steady performance of Japan, the signs of European decline, and the emergence of new economies that include Korea, Taiwan and Israel. By considering the most popular technologies per each decade, we observe a clear pattern in the evolution of world economic structure, most notably, the IT revolution. Interestingly, it is precisely in these IT-related technologies in which Korea have performed especially well. In the fastest growing technologies of the most recent decade, however, Koreaâ€™s performance thus far bucks this rosy trend. Koreaâ€™s innovative capacity is not as evenly distributed across all technologies as other advanced nations.

We take an interacted panel VAR approach using a panel of 28 countries and thereby obtain several interesting findings. That is, the responses of consumption and investment to monetary shocks are stronger in the state of high household debts. Such responses furthermore become larger in a contractionary monetary policy stance rather than in an expansionary one. Finally, we find that the negative impact of contractionary monetary shocks on the real economy is stronger in the countries with a higher share of adjustable rate loans. We conjecture that these findings lend support for the presence of ""cash flow channel"" with respect to the transmission of contractionary monetary policy."

 """,2017.,The Effect of the DIP on the Business Performances of Rehabilitated Corporates (in Korean),"2017-34, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","It has been 10 years since implementation of the Debtor in Possession (DIP), under which in principle the original management becomes legal administrators under the Debtor Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act. While this institution prevents original management from being deprived of their management rights and thus helps the corporates to go through prompt rehabilitation procedures, there have been more than a few cases of abuse of the institution in order to obtain debt relief and maintain control over the corporates. Accordingly, opinions calling for improvement of the institution have been steadily raised, in academia, the National Assembly and the financial sector. Meanwhile, there have been a number of papers from the economics perspective on the effects of corporate governance on the business performances of normal firms. However, it is hard to find studies of such effects on the performances of rehabilitated corporates. This paper has therefore analyzed the effects on rehabilitated firms' business results of the DIP, which could be regarded as a form of corporate governance of them. To deal with the issue of endogeneity between corporate governance and firms' business performances, we have used propensity score analysis as our main analysis methodology. According to our analysis, opportunistic profit adjustment practices of corporations have declined under the DIP. However, the business performances of the corporates rehabilitated under the DIP have either worsened compared to those of firms without the DIP application or there have been no significant statistical differences between them. These results imply that corporates under the DIP have been unable to adjust their profits due to the court's control, but that their efforts to rehabilitate themselves have been insufficient. This result has the following implications. First, since the DIP was implemented, the number of firms that have applied for corporate rehabilitation has surged, but as there have been no remarkable improvements in the business performances of corporations under the DIP, such that it is necessary to make efforts to enhance the DIP from the overall standpoint of corporate restructuring. Second, from a more detailed perspective, in order to keep management's moral hazard in check, it is necessary to strengthen the function of the creditors committee as well as enhance the abilities of market participants including sovereign credit rating agencies and investment companies to monitor the debtors."

In particular, we analyze the impact on its profitability after adding the gap cost to the Monti-Klein(1971)'s bank profit function which considers three important interest rates in the monetary policy transmission- interbank rate, deposit rate, and loan rate. As a result of the theoretical model analysis, in case of the loan amount exceeding the deposit amount in the low interest rate phase, the bank profitability improves as both deposit and loan rates fall under zero. However, this is in contradiction to the fact that European banks' profitabilities deteriorate due to NPIR. To resolve the contradiction, we also assumes the downward rigidity of deposit rate. If banks have the downward rigidity in deposit rates due to either the burden of securing deposits, which is the source of lending, or limitations on the expansion of the loan scale caused by the gap cost, its overall profitability may deteriorate. It is so because of both deteriorating profitability in deposits and limitation on the improvement of profitability in loan. In addition, we find that these deteriorating profitability are deepened as either the number of competing banks or the gap cost increases. Conversely, it should be noted that if the deposit rate is downwardly rigid under NPIR, it will not directly lead to the bank's profitability deterioration. However, as in the analysis of the paper, if the profitability of the bank deteriorates due to both limitations on the deposit rate adjustment and the increase in the loan under NPIR, negative interest rate policy(NIRP) should be conducted only in very exceptional circumstance."

 """,2017.,Impact of Population Aging on the Financial Sector (in Korean),"2017-31, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","This paper investigates the main channels through which population aging affects the financial sector. Based on the results, we conjecture possible changes in the structure of the financial sector due to the aging. Empirical evidence from international panel data shows that population aging is associated with a higher growth rate of household net assets and does not suppress household debt growth. In addition, the insurance, pension and asset management industries are expected to increase their shares in the financial sector. Furthermore, population aging causes lower longer-term interest rates which leads to a flatter yield curve, while it affects stock prices positively because of higher asset demand by households. To complement the international panel data analysis, we also implement a simulation of household balance sheets based on Korea-specific data, 'The Survey of Household Finance and Living Conditions.' The main findings are as follows. First, the financial industry is expected to keep growing until the late 2020s thanks to increasing household financial assets, which would also contribute to higher long-term financial asset demand. Second, aging-induced low economic growth and low interest rates together with flattened yield curves will likely lead to lower profitability for financial institutions. Third, under low interest rates, households would increase their stock or fund investments to seek higher yields. Fourth, if elderly-headed households keep their asset allocations biased towards real assets, population aging could increase the concentration of household assets into real assets. These findings imply that the supply of long-term bonds needs to be increased to meet increased demand from the financial institutions where households accumulate their assets. Furthermore, financial institutions should diversify their income sources and strengthen their risk management to cope with lower profitability. Finally, authorities need to help households to reduce liquidity and price risk related to real estate by making reverse mortgages more accessible."

However, the magnitude of the anticipated decline remains unclear and differs according to the choice of labor input measure. If the current patterns of gender- and age-specific labor supply would remain unchanged, it is projected that the number of employed population and the total hours of work will decrease to 88% and 83% of the current levels, respectively. The actual decline in labor inputs will heavily depend on long-term changes of labor supply, especially employment of the elderly and women as well as unemployment of younger people. Given that long-term trend of labor demand is highly unpredictable, it is difficult to determine whether a large-scale decline in the work force (if actually emerged) will cause significant labor shortages. Furthermore, the extent of labor shortage will widely differ across industries and across worker types because of sectoral disparities in labor-demand changes. Over the next 10~15 years, the overall size of labor inputs in Korea will not diminish. However, the exit of the baby boom generation from the work force can produce serious labor shortages in sectors with high and increasing fractions of aging workers. In particular, population aging will hit hard the industries in which the entry of young workers is insufficient to meet rapidly growing labor demand."

The result reveals that the Korean industry structure, both in terms of value added production and employment, is greatly influenced by the future change in it's population, such as population aging and declining working age population and total population. First, the Korean population structure change is expected to bring about a decrease in the share of the manufacturing sector, centering on the low skilled manufacturing sector, while an increase in the service sector, especially in the business activity sector and the health and social work sector. Second, due to the change in the population structure, the productivity of the manufacturing sector, relative to that of the whole industry, tends to fall, while that of the service sector rises. Third, the ratio of export to value added production in most manufacturing sectors rises along with the change in the population structure."

To identify these impacts empirically, this paper sets up a hypothesis and conducts an analysis through a macroeconomic panel model using economic indicators from OECD member countries, and through a microeconomic panel model using Korean labor and income panel data. The results of empirical analysis show that, as the level of population aging increases, the household savings ratio and the share of households' investment in risky assets decline. The financial debt-to-financial assets ratio is found to fall as the level of aging rises, but this fall was statistically insignificant. In the microeconomic panel model, considering the cohort effect, the baby-boomer generation that experienced a period of high economic growth is found to have been able to build up more real and financial assets than the generations before them. In addition, the elderly are found to maintain their financial assets to some extent, rather than reducing them, owing mainly to the precautionary savings and bequest motives, while their real assets show modest downward movements. However, it is estimated that high-income elderly people, belonging to the fifth income quintile group, will reduce their real assets to repay their debts, hold financial assets for retirement savings, and so on. This paper is significant in that it verifies not only the impacts of aging on households' asset and liability structures but also the impacts of factors such as the retirement of baby-boomers in Korea through microeconomic panel data. This is expected to have implications for us in coming up with policy solutions related to aging."

 """,2017.,Effects of Population Aging on International Investment (in Korean),"2017-26, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","This paper conducts an empirical estimation of the effects of population aging on international investment, in consideration of the fact, especially in an environment of deeply integrated global financial markets, that differences in degrees of aging across countries can amplify capital movements. Through this estimation, this paper examines whether the life-cycle hypothesis of Modigliani also applies to the external sector, and the international investment assets accumulated are used to cover consumption when a mismatch between income and consumption occurs due to population aging. We analyze the impacts of demographic variables--the old-age dependency ratio and the pace of aging--on foreign investment (foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI)), using annual data for 54 countries between 2001 and 2015. We find as a result that the life-cycle hypothesis holds for the external sector as well. First, our study shows that population aging leads to a significant decrease in international investment. A reduction in international investment assets means a decline in future sources for supply of foreign currency. This suggests that if international investment assets decrease dramatically, it could lead to concerns about possible insolvency and cause the creditworthiness of a country to fall, resulting in pressures for outflows of capital from it. Meanwhile, looking at the effects depending upon the nature of investment, we find that the negative impact on FDI due to aging is more significant than that on FPI. While foreign investment increases significantly with a bigger working age population, it declines significantly as aging proceeds more rapidly. The level of significance of the pace of aging is also much higher than that of the old-age dependency ratio. Given these effects of population aging on international investment, there is a possibility that progress in population aging could undermine stability in the external sector. In this regard, Korea, one of the rapidly aging societies, should make preparations to minimize the negative effects of aging on its external sector. Viable strategies in this regard are improving the primary income balance through promoting foreign investment, and introducing policies to increase the birthrate. Meanwhile, additional studies are required to analyze in greater detail the effects of aging from various perspectives, such as that of behavioral changes in international investment depending upon maturity and upon investor type, and that of the external debt dynamics. We hope that this paper might pave the way for such future research."

In particular, the rate of population aging in Korea is faster than that in other major countries, and it is highly likely that the effects of populations aging on the housing market will appear to be compressive as baby boomers become 65 or above after 2020. First of all, in the case of housing occupation type and residential area, it is necessary for some elderly households to preserve their income by disposing houses under insufficient provision of future living expenses. This phenomenon is expected to slow down the growth of housing demand, on top of young households decreasing demand for housing and shrinking residential areas. In addition, as the number of elderly household with 1~2 people increases and the need for liquidation of housing assets after retirement grows, demand for small- to mid-sized houses and apartments is likely to increase. Meanwhile, It is highly likely that the leasing market will continue to change due to an increase in incentives to pursue stable cash flows through monthly rental for multi-house owners and young households' steady demand for leases. In order to prevent structural changes in house market, due to population aging, from causing supply-demand imbalance of the housing market, it is necessary to stabilize the supply and demand of mid- and long-term housing. At the same time, supplying customized housing for the aged, expanding public rental housing for people with housing disadvantages such as young, low income, and impoverished elderly and promoting inventory management measures such as utilization of vacant houses should be implemented. Especially, if the housing disposal of baby boomers is concentrated in the short term, it can act as a pressure to lower house price. To this end, measures should be taken to mitigate the pressure on the sale of housing for the elderly, such as the activation of housing pensions and the support for retirement home lease conversion."

These scenarios are set up in consideration of the demographic changes in Germany, observed after its Reunification: the fertility rate of East Germany dropped by half right after unification; and its life expectancy converged to the level of West Germany. Therefore, the fertility shock and the convergence of life expectancy are reflected in the scenarios of North Korean population after unification. Besides, this study assumes a scenario where the fertility rate of the North could increase due to an improvement in child-care environment and public health, considering the distinct features of the inter-Korean unification. The main finding of this study is as follows. The population integration of the two Koreas may alleviate the burden of population aging of South Korea. This positive impact, however, may be gradually reduced if the North's fertility rate sharply drops and life expectancy converges to the level of the South. Yet, the level of population aging may be continuously reduced in case the fertility rate of the North raises even though its life expectancy converges to the level of the South."

This non-linear effects of the elderly dependency ratio on the current account differentiates our findings from existing literatures. Population aging may affect economic agents' behavior, economic structure, and economic policies, which may explain the non-linear effect. In Korea, the projected elderly dependency ratio is expected to increase sharply as aging population continues to rise. It is uncertain whether this spike in the old-dependency ratio would negatively affect the current account balance since the effect may change as population aging proceeds."

 """,2017.,Demographic Policies against Aging in OECD countries (in Korean),"2017-22, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","In most advanced economies, population aging has been happening due to low fertility and long life expectancy, which has increased the burden of supporting the elderly and lowered the share of working-age population. Many countries have embarked on demographic policies against a decrease in potential growth due to low fertility and fast aging, an increase in cost of social security, and inter-generational conflicts between the young and the old. This paper researches on various policies by OECD countries focusing on work-family balance, pension reform, employment policies, and immigration policies; we also provide some lessons for Korea by comparing its demographic policies with other OECD countries. Demographic policies against aging have succeeded only when they are combined in an effective manner with work-family balance, pension reform, employment policies, and immigration policies. Especially, it is necessary to lower the wage differential between genders and to change the sociocultural understanding of childbirth and childbearing. As for pension reform, it is recommended to adjust the qualifying age of the national pension and to cooperate with private pension providers in order to enhance the sustainability of the pension system. At the same time, the system should be able to help the elderly secure income after retirement to prevent elderly poverty; to this end, the blind spot of the pension system needs to be resolved, such as low income earners and temporary workers. With respect to employment policies, it is necessary to adopt a division of labor between the elderly and the youth, along with age specific policies. More specifically, employment services tailored for the elderly may support job searching and help them to continue previous careers; in the youth front, active labor market policies will increase youth employment, such as combining education with job training. Finally, it is about time to decide on Korea's position on immigration policies--in terms of both employment policies and demographic policies with more inclusive stance for foreign workers."

However, more specifically, how and to what extent population aging affects economy is considerably influenced by economic system, agents' behaviour, and policy maker's policies. Thus, the effect of population aging will be decided by our response to this challenge. This paper estimates the effect of population aging on economic growth based on a simple growth accounting model, reflecting the demographic projection released by the National Statistics Office. The result shows that the economic growth rate of Korea is estimated to gradually decline from 3.9% (2000 to 2015) to 1.9% (2016 to 2025) to 0.4% (2026 to 2035) on annual average. However, if Korea implements comprehensive measures (e.g. extending retirement age, encouraging women's economic participation, along with improving productivity and fertility rates) responding to population aging, the economic growth rate is predicted to maintain between 2.5~3.0% in 10 years and around 1.5% in 20 years on annual average. Since the effect of population aging on economy may be dramatically changed according to policy responses, comprehensive measures should be set up at the national level to reduce the population aging speed and to alleviate negative effects, followed by more detailed action plans in each sector."

In addition, the role of the court in restructuring insolvent firms is emphasized. The court employes the Fast-Track corporate rehabilitation program for swift rehabilitation proceedings; and recently, the rehabilitation-specialized court has been set up, combining the advantages of work-out and legal management. Given the fact that a swift rehabilitation procedure is very critical due to the risk of the collapse of business foundation (e.g. falling asset value), this paper analyzes the effect of the Fast-Track program, introduced for a swift rehabilitation procedure. We use a Differences-in-Differences model, an econometric technique, to analyze and compare prior-and-post effects of policy implementation. The analysis result shows that the effect of this program on the ICR of the companies under court receivership is positive except enough statistical significance. Their business foundation has been undermined before and after court receivership and they have difficulties in securing funds due to bankruptcy stigma even after the termination of receivership, resulting in curbing the effect of the program. The same result is observed in the estimation by size and business (e.g. large companies, small and medium companies, and manufacturing). As for certain industries, subject to government restructuring, we do not find enough statistical significance in the analysis of Fast-Track effect, except for chemistry. In the case of chemistry, the Fast-Track program is helpful to increase the chances for rehabilitation owing to domestic companies' strong competitiveness. For steel and shipbuilding, however, the effect of Fast-Track seems to be not enough; their industrial competitiveness has been weakened, notably, in small and medium sized companies. This result has following implications. First, to improve the effect of Fast-Track, institutional efforts are required to reduce disadvantages induced by bankruptcy stigma (e.g. a fall in credit rating and high risk premiums). In particular, specific measures are needed for companies, graduating from court receivership, to do business as normal companies. Next, as observed in the empirical analysis of steel and shipbuilding, the effect of Fast-Track may not be exercised to the full with weakened industrial competitiveness. Therefore, restructuring efforts such as business reshuffle seem to be necessary. If these issues are resolved, the Fast-Track effect will be gradually improved, and consequently the Fast-Track program will be successfully settled."

We first consider a distribution of household debt conditional on the overall payment ability, and specify the over-indebted household as the one whose debt exceeds Î¸-quantile of the conditional distribution. The overall payment ability is set to cover a variety of factors such as disposable income, assets, expected income, and consumption backgrounds. Î¸-quantile is estimated using Chernozhukov and Hong (2002)'s three step estimator for censored quantile regression. The empirical analysis shows a clear evidence of heterogeneous behavior of the over-indebted households compared to the others. We find that over-indebted households' income and real estate elasticities of debt are significantly higher and their debt/income ratio has increased faster in recent periods of low interest rates. Simulation study shows that these distinctive properties cause over-indebted households facing far greater default risks under macroeconomic shocks such as interest rate hikes and house price drops.

 """,2017.,Demographic Change and Long Term Trend of Inflation: The Case of South Korea (in Korean),"2017-11, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Since the global financial crisis, long term trend of global inflation remains low in spite of the fact that major developed countries implemented long-lasting intensively accommodating policies. One possible explanation is that demographic change such as population aging has affected the long term trend of inflation. Japanese 'lost decades' could be a persuasive evidence of the effect of demographic change on long term inflation. Recent literature on this topic provides much evidence that population aging could affect growth and inflation rate through the various and complicated channels such as labor supply, savings rate, real wage, labor productivity, asset prices and fiscal burdens. However, a unified conclusion is not reached from the theoretical and empirical literature since the direction and extent of the effects are different from country to country depending on the stage and type of the demographic change. This study presents some simulation results based on a dynamic general equilibrium monetary model in which demographic changes are captured by the change of working population ratio. The simulation results show that in case of South Korea where the working population ratio is starting to decline from this year, the effect of population aging on long term trend of inflation is being realized since mid 2020's as a weak but long-lasting downside pressure. These results tell us that the effects of demographic changes on long term inflation should be considered when making a long term inflation target. They also gives an implication that those effects could not be counter-acted by the short term demand management policy. As a result, it would be better to focus on the policies for structural reform to minimize the negative consequences of the demographic change."

The results of this analysis show that oil prices make a statistically significant effect on the BEIs with maturities of 2 year, 5 year, and 10 year. These sensitivities are salient in the BEIs with shorter maturities. These implies that the changes in oil prices can affect inflation expectations in the short term but this effect gets diminished to the extinction because inflation expectations depend on the inflation target of a monetary policy. Notably, the 5Y5Y BEI has a statistically significant relation with the changes in oil prices only when the slope of oil futures curve flattens and oil prices are falling. This observation reveals that financial market participants adjust their inflation expectations with confidence only in case of the simultaneous drop of the slope of oil futures curve and oil prices. Assuming the BEI is a reasonable estimator of inflation expectations extracted from financial market, oil prices make a limited impact on medium and long term inflation expectations (5Y5Y BEI). From these results we can make an inference that current movements of oil prices and financial market participants'expectation of oil price path make joint contribution to the formation of medium and long term inflation expectations."

In the vector autoregression(VAR) analysis, durable goods and nondurable goods comove in response to a credit supply shock. However, in a two-sector New Keynesian model with flexible wage, the output of nondurables decreases, while the output of durables and total output increase in response to a negative credit supply shock(LTV ratio tightening). Therefore, the comovement problem in two-sector New Keynesian model arises to a credit supply shock. If we introduce the nominal wage stickiness, the output of nondurables and durables decrease together and, as a result, total output also decreases. This result is robust to the degree of wage stickiness and to durable price stickiness. The share of borrowers also does not influence the main result."

Specifically, this paper empirically tests if prospect theory's loss aversion decreases insurance demand and increases savings demand. Prospect theory predicts that boundedly rational consumers may view pure protection insurance, such as term-life insurance, as a risky investment because the insured may lose premiums if a bad event does not occur within the pre-specified term. Hence, those who are fairly sensitive to the potential loss choose not to buy term-life insurance. Instead, they may choose a more safe option to prepare for uncertain future events by increasing precautionary saving. This paper tests such prediction using individual-level data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and finds empirical evidence consistent with the prediction: loss-averse individuals are less likely to own term-life insurance and more likely to own whole-life insurance, which serves as a partial savings instrument. These individuals also hold a higher level of wealth than others, suggesting that they tend to save more (presumably for precautionary motives), all other things being equal."

Parameters of the diffusion model with nonlinear general drift and volatility function vary depending on the economic states and are estimated using maximum likelihood method. In order to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates, we use the algorithm of Hamilton (1989) and calculate transition probability density function (TPDF) using Choi (2015a)'s method from the approximate log-TPDF obtained by AÃ¯t-Sahalia (2008)'s irreducible method. We find evidences that there exist two different regime and that the volatility term of the model explains the movements of the call rate better than the drift term. Also, the model shows that the transition probability varies depending on the level of interest rate. As interest rate increases, the probability of remaining at the same regime ""L"" next period decreases while the probability for the regime ""H"" increases. The estimated smoothed probability of regime ""H,"" which is close to 1 and 0 during the period with high and low volatility respectively, is a clear evidence of the existence of two different regimes. Lastly, comparison with existing models demonstrates that the generalized model in this paper is preferred in explaining the call rate behaviour."

It finds that changes in the probability of mortgage loan default have been affected mainly by the interest rate factor since 2012. It finds in addition that the affects of the interest rate and risk factors in determining the default probability differ depending upon borrowers' ages and their income-to-loan ratios. Specifically, while the probabilities of home mortgage loan default due to the interest rate factor have dropped regardless of personal characteristics since 2012, for borrowers in their 20s to 30s and with low income-to-loan ratios the probability of default caused by the risk factor is found to have risen compared to June 2012. This is the first study to estimate the factors causing default based on personal borrower characteristics through use of personal lending and delinquency panel data. It is believed that our study may provide important information about the sources of mortgage loan risk and accordingly help in the putting forward of policy response alternatives."

Therefore, we empirically analyze the determinants of exit of self-employed businesses in Korea, using panel data on wholesale & retail trade, restaurant & lodging, repair and other individual service industries from ""Census on Establishments"" provided by the Statistics Korea. With Cox's proportional hazards model, we estimate the effects of various demand, cost, and competition factors on the exit rate of businesses in major industries of self-employment. According to estimation results, cost factors: rents, lending interest rates, and fixed personnel expenses as well as demand factors: consumer price index (CPI) and gross regional domestic product (GRDP) have considerable effects on the shutdown rate of self-employed businesses. The number of competitors and business-specific characteristics such as the age and size of business are also estimated to have significant effect."

Most previous studies have been interested in the economic effects of FTAs such as the effects on economic growth, income distribution across industries, price competitiveness for international trade, trade volume, and the price of a commodity. The purpose of this study is an econometric estimation of the price stabilization due to FTAs and an analysis of how FTAs affect inflation rates based on panel data estimations. The main results are summarized as follows. First, from an analysis on 72 detailed items which estimates the pricing equations for the 72 detailed items, calculates the but-for-price after FTAs started, and gets the weighted price index, we find that FTAs reduce the CPI inflation rate by 0.76%p at an annual basis from the second quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2015. Second, the aggregate data analysis estimates the effect of FTAs on the CPI inflation rate as -0.52%p and the effect of the global financial crisis on the CPI inflation rate as -0.47%p. Third, the panel data analysis for the OECD countries also shows a significant and consistent inflation reduction effect of FTAs, such effect is more significant than the effect of traditional openness on inflation rates. The inflation reduction effect of FTAs is more significant in countries with a low level of openness."

The result of empirical estimation with GMM reveals that the flow effect of household debt facilitates consumption and economic growth while the stock effect hinders them. It is also found that the contribution of the flow effect on raising consumption and economic growth has decreased since 2000, however the contribution of the stock effect on impeding consumption and economic growth has expanded. The coefficients of flow effect and stock effect may change over time. Since the global financial crisis, the coefficient of flow effect has been scaled down, mainly because of the expansion of household mortgage loans that brought about a reduction in the share of household borrowing for consumption. The coefficient of stock effect has also decreased in size as the burden of household loan repayment was mitigated due to a fall in interest rates on household loans."

Around the Fed's monetary policy announcement (event) week, we find that equity investors appear to temporarily increase (decrease) their portfolio holdings in South Korea upon a more-than-expected contractionary (expansionary) interest rate policy, while bond investors do not change their portfolio holdings much. This result is robust to the exclusion of influential observations, alternative estimation methods as well as inclusion of an additional explanatory variable which explicitly controls for possible endogeneity. Additionally, we conduct the full sample regression analysis including event and non-event weeks after controlling for the pull and push factors that are likely to be associated with the international capital flow. Our empirical evidence shows that unexpected US policy shocks have a significant negative impact on certain types of international capital flow. Specifically, the unexpected US contractionary monetary policy appears to be associated with equity fund outflow from the US, passive and institutional investors and bond fund outflow from retail investors."

 """,2016.,Development of Corporate Vulnerability Index and a Connection with Corporate Insolvency (in Korean),"2016-20, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","It has been usually taken into account that higher debts of a company tend to increase the risk of insolvency. In the case of Korea, the debt to equity ratio seems to have been stable after the Asian financial crisis thanks to the regulatory effort of reducing companies' debt to equity ratio below 200%. By the way, unlike the debt to equity ratio, corporate default theories implicate that many Korean companies are highly likely to face default conditions, and the number of companies undergoing restructuring is growing much fast lately. Based on such motivation, this paper develops a new corporate vulnerability index including several debt-related ratios and helping to capture corporate risks, and analyzes the effect of the vulnerability index on corporate insolvency. The index is calculated for the whole, marginal, chronic marginal, and default-risk companies by applying both principal component analysis and dynamic factor analysis with indicators from IMF's CVU(Corporate Vulnerability Utility). The result shows that the vulnerability index for chronic marginal companies corresponds to the bankruptcy rate on promissory notes which represents the level of coporate insolvency, and recently the index is in a rising trend. According to the estimation of the effect of chronic marginal companies' vulnerability index on corporate insolvency of regular companies through the panel logit model, the probability of turing into marginal or default-risk companies from regular companies increases as the vulnerability index increases. The implications of the results are as follows. First, swift and steady restructuring needs to be executed for stable real economy. Next, the development of comprehensive indicators by which to detect risk signs, like the corporate vulnerability index in this paper, is required to use them as sub-indicators to assess financial stability."

This issue, crucial to understanding the dynamics of the emergence of a new international monetary order, remains long underexplored in the existing literature, which tends to adopt a supply-side approach analyzing mainly the international currency issuers. Our study addresses this important question, with a focus on the case of the Chinese renminbi, by employing a demand-side approach examining the international currency users through generalized ordered logistic regression analysis. Our primary argument is that a state hosting a major global financial center--a condition largely independent of influence from countries issuing international currencies--is likely to be more interested in enhancing its use of the renminbi, implying thereby that global financial institutions and the related inter-state rivalries among international currency users may play crucial roles in the shaping of a new international monetary order. We in addition find significant impacts on a state's interest in renminbi use resulting from its institutional economic cooperation with China through a preferential trade agreement or a bilateral investment treaty, but that a country's mere trade and investment integration with China does not meaningfully affect its government's support for renminbi use."

According to the analysis on 2014 survey on the working conditions, the increase in non-regular workers negatively influence income inequality in Korea.

Suppose that once a borrower fails to pay back a loan to a bank, he cannot borrow from any banks again and must contact higher-interest charging credit finance companies to get a new loan. This creates a well-defined incentive for borrowers: pay back and remain in the banks' loan market vs. do not pay back and move to, say, credit finance companies' loan market in which a higher loan rate is charged. This mechanism does not require the financial firms to verify even if the borrower declares bankruptcy, and therefore is more efficient than a standard debt contract Ã la Townsend (1979) in terms of verification cost. As the interest rates offered by different types of financial firms should be well aligned in order to prevent the deception of borrowers, we can also analyze how many different types of financial firms, that is, how many discrete and different loan rates, can co-exist in the economy."

Moreover, this study investigates the effect of tax haven investors' trading on liquidity and volatility in the stock market, by focusing on total trading volume, gross buy volume, gross sell volume, and net buy volume. The main findings of this study are threefold. First, target firm values subsequent to the announcement of tax haven investors' block acquisition show a different pattern of change compared to those subsequent to the announcement of domestic investors' or other foreign investors' block ownership. However, the difference is not statistically significant. Second, tax haven investors' shareholding is not found to have a significant impact on target firms' corporate governance, dividends, R&D investments, stock liquidity, or idiosyncratic risk. Third, tax haven investors' trading exacerbates liquidity in the stock market and increases stock return volatility.

In non-cooperation, each policy authority's optimal response is to tighten its policy measures when the inflation gap, the output gap and the credit gap expand, and when other authorities' policy measures are loosened. This indicates that the two policies are substitutes for each other. The condition for the response functions to converge to a Nash equilibrium and the speed of convergence depend on the authorities' preferences and the economic structure. If the financial supervisory authority (FSA) puts greater importance on the output gap, the probability of non-convergence increases and the speed of convergence declines even when the condition of convergence is satisfied. When the policy authorities fully cooperate with each other, they can establish an optimal combination of policy responses to each of the three gaps."

This study aims at investigating the effects of FTAs on the role of local subsidiaries of Korean firms that already made inroads into the FTA partner country by analyzing the effects of FTAs on intra-firm trade between Korean firms and their foreign subsidiaries using firm-level data on FDI. The results show that FTAs have been contributing to the expansion of sales of local subsidiaries in both Korea and third countries, although they have not significantly affected the expansion of sales of Korean firms to their foreign subsidiaries. Particularly in the manufacturing industry, FTAs have significant positive effects on the sales in Korea of local subsidiaries in addition to the sales in third countries. After analysing data by ownership, we find that when Korean firms have enough ownership to control their local subsidiaries overseas, FTAs have significant positive effects on the sales of local subsidiaries in both Korea and third countries. The results suggest that from the perspective of intra-firm trade, Korean firms have utilized their existing local subsidiaries as a platform for exports to a third country or a way to import products such as raw materials or intermediary goods after FTAs went into effect. The results also show that an increase in the sales of local subsidiaries in third countries, in particular, can have indirect positive effects on Korean firms through consolidated financial statements."

Additionally, a small-open economy structure is imposed on the FAVAR model to separately identify the domestic and foreign interest rate shocks. The results suggest that a raise in the key rate by the Bank of Korea decreases the employment-to-population ratio (EPR) of young male workers while other worker groups do not respond in a similar fashion. This implies that a labor demand channel of monetary policy works only in the young male workers market. This finding is also in concord with the fact that young workers confront a relatively high unemployment rate compared to other population groups since a larger reserve labor force means a bigger sensitivity to a change in labor demand change."

For this purpose, we employ DSUR proposed by Mark, Ogaki, and Sul (2005), SURECM, and two causality tests by Granger (1969) and Sims (1972) in a system method to account for cross equation correlations among markets which have a close relationship with one another. Furthermore, we make use of information in the variance-covariance matrix of residual to improve the efficiency of the statistical estimates. The empirical evidence from the system method indicates that fund flows do not respond to eliminate the deviation from long-run equilibrium, and stock prices cause net fund flows in the Korean market, implying that investors move their money to the securities that yield higher returns to rebalance their investment portfolios in the short-run. Thus, our findings do not support the popular notion that considers mutual fund flows as a driving force behind rallies in Korean financial markets."

Our approach constructs effective input price indices from sector-level price data combined with sector-level information on input-output linkages. Applying an error correction model specification to sector-level output and input prices, the long-run pass-through rate of effective imported input costs to domestic producer prices is estimated to be around 70 percent in Korea and almost 100 percent in selected European countries."

This paper estimates a series of VAR-X models for a set of 10 emerging economies, that is, VARs in which U.S. policy enters exogenously. The contribution of this paper is (1) to use an identified shock component of the U.S. (shadow) Federal Funds rate as a consistent policy instrument for conventional and unconventional policies, (2) to account for changes in the transmission of U.S. monetary policy over time, (3) to quantify asymmetries in the transmission of tightening and easing shocks, and (4) to relate the exposure of emerging countries with macroeconomic fundamentals. The results point to substantially nonlinear and asymmetric spillover effects, which pose challenges to policymakers."

We employ the method of the principal components for 198 monthly frequency macroeconomic data to extract multiple latent factors that summarize the common components of the entire data set. We evaluate the out-of-sample predictability of our models via the ratio of the root mean squared prediction errors and the Diebold-Mariano-West statistics. Our factor models overall outperform the random walk model in forecasting the financial stress indices for up to 1-year forecast horizon. Our models also perform fairly well relative to a stationary autoregressive model especially when the forecast horizon is short, which is practically useful because financial crises often occur abruptly with no systemic warning signals. Parsimonious models with small number of factors perform as well as bigger models. Overall, our findings imply that not only financial data but also real activity variables can help out-of-sample forecast the vulnerability in the financial markets."

We develop a simple twoÂ­country model that focuses on the multistage production process, and apply Time-Varying Parameter (TVP) VAR to the countries' bilateral trade data. From our theoretical model, we find two distinct features of vertical specialization where multistage production processes occur: one is that, when a multistage production process exists, an increase in final demand in one country causes both countries' intermediate goods exports to expand; the other is that, if a multistage production process exists in the production of one country's final goods, then real depreciation of the currency in the other country has an amplified effect through the circulating trade chain. In the following empirical analysis, we first find that a multistage production process is prominent in the production of China's final consumption goods. Another finding is that the existence of a multistage production process across two countries, especially Korea and China, strengthens the effect of the real exchange rate on intermediate goods trades through the amplified effect that the theoretical model predicts."

We run a panel regression of firm growth in a country- and industry-specific relative energy efficiency (REE) to the corresponding industrial sector in the benchmark country (the U.S.) in addition to the traditional energy efficiency measure (EE) using simply the inverse of energy intensity, after controlling several firm, industry, and country variables. We find that REE and EE might have a somewhat different impact on firm growth in terms of profits, although improvements in both REE and EE have a positive effect on the growth rate of sales and capital accumulation. This result indicates that REE as well as EE need to be considered when analyzing the linkages running between energy efficiency and firm growth. Compared to the six country case, we find that the efficient use of energy inputs in Korea has made a smaller contribution to firm growth."

Desirable reference rates should have strong interconnectedness with macroeconomic variables, and be robust so that their actual paths do not deviate largely from expectations. We first compare some widely used reference rates in Korea using an impulse response analysis based upon Factor Augmented Vector Autoregression. We find that the KORIBOR delivers the largest responses to macroeconomic variables, while the differences in responses among the reference rates are moderate. To compare the robustness of the reference rates, we compute their impulse responses at multiple conditional quantile levels and examine the probability of the actual responses differing greatly from market expectations. We also find that the probability increases after an expansionary monetary policy shock, and that the KORIBOR shows relatively small increase. This implies the advantage of the KORIBOR in terms of the robustness. The bank debenture rate is shown to be most vulnerable to such a shock. Negative output and inflation shocks also give rise to increased instability due to economic downturns, and the relative performances of the reference rates are analogous to those during a case of monetary policy shock."

In order to characterize the Korean labor market more realistically, the model is extended by specifying a small open economy with tradable and nontradable goods sectors. The results of empirical analyses based on the estimated model can be summarized as follows. First, it is confirmed that the sectoral reallocation of labors plays an important role in the adjustments of Korean labor market responding to some macroeconomic shocks, particularly foreign shocks. Second, the historical decomposition analysis demonstrates that the cyclical fluctuations of unemployment in Korea are mostly explained by key domestic shocks such as domestic productivity shocks and preference shocks. A relatively small contribution of foreign shocks onto aggregate labor market variables is in part due to the sectoral shift of employment rather than changes in aggregate employment and labor force at extensive margins."

 """,2015.,Deflation and Monetary Policy,"2015-25, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Deflation has replaced inflation as the principal challenge for monetary policy in many countries. But influential voices question whether deflation is properly seen as a problem for economic growth and financial stability. They question whether recent experience with deflation is more than a transitory phenomenon associated with the aftermath of the financial crisis and record-low oil prices. And they doubt whether monetary policy can be used to address the deflation problem without creating even more serious risks. Historical experience as I read it generally confirms that deflation is a problem whose solution should be a priority for central banks. Japan's experience in particular suggests that deflation problems do not solve themselves. The jury is still out on whether, once deflation is underway, concerted monetary policy action can return inflation to its positive target levels. My own view is that it can. If the policies to date have not achieved their goal, then the central bank or banks in question need to do more. If doing more threatens financial stability, then tools other than monetary policy -- so-called macroprudential tools -- are appropriate for addressing these risks. If a central bank runs out of government securities to buy or worries about dangerously reducing the liquidity of the government bond market, then it can buy other assets. The policy response to deflation is straightforward. The only question is whether the relevant authorities will pursue it."

We find that these liquidity measures, especially bank credit, were greater than the implied liquidity before the financial crisis. They temporarily fell after the crisis due to the delay in economic recovery, and have recently come to move around the implied liquidity. Furthermore, an increase in the implied liquidity during an economic expansion causes housing price appreciation and inflation.

This paper investigates the impact of foreign capital flows on GDP growth surprise (= realized GDP growth rate -- expected GDP growth rate) and financial market volatility. We find that FDI and foreign bank loans are positively associated with unexpected GDP growth on a contemporaneous basis, while increases in foreign bond and equity investment induce lower GDP growth than expected in the following year. Volatility in all four types of foreign capital flows is positively related to stock market volatility only in the case of a crisis. Volatility in bank loans is likely to have a larger impact here than will volatility in equity investment. Higher volatility in FDI, foreign equity investment and bank loans amplify foreign exchange market volatility during a crisis while mitigating it during a non-crisis period. The volatility of foreign bond investment meanwhile has the strongest positive effect on foreign exchange rate volatility in the case of a crisis, but has no effect in a non-crisis period. The possible costs of foreign capital flows in EMEs should incentivize policymakers to introduce capital flow management measures or macroprudential measures, in order to ensure macroeconomic stability as well as financial stability."

When looking at aggregate regional inflation, we find that the mean, volatility and persistence fell in all cities in the wake of the monetary policy regime change, consistent with other evidence in the literature. We also note a narrowing of the dispersion of regional inflation across cities and a greater degree of regional co-movement. Delving more deeply into the disaggregate data reveals additional insights however. For most of the changes we observe in the dynamics of regional inflation, we find that the aggregate effects are being driven primarily by sectors that fall into the 'Services' category. We posit that the impact of better anchored inflationary expectations is primarily on the less-traded services sectors of the economy, where the domestic monetary policy framework has a relatively larger influence compared with globally-traded commodities. When it comes to the increased co-movement observed across regions under IT regime, however, it is the 'Commodities' sectors rather than 'Services' that are responsible, probably because services inflation becomes relatively more influenced by local factors once it has stabilized within the target range. We show that this sectoral heterogeneity can be explained by the difference in price stickiness such that sectors in which prices are adjusted less frequently tend to have a larger response under the new monetary policy regime."

Considering the cross-platform externalities in payment processing, differentiated preferences for payment platforms, and competitive bottleneck on the consumer side, we derive the following results. When only the entry of a vertically integrated (or end-to-end service) provider is allowed, either all merchants choose to multi-home or no entry occurs, regardless of the regulatory requirement. On the other hand, if the entry of a downstream-only (or front-end service) provider is possible, a partial multi-homing equilibrium result can emerge for some conditions under which the entry of an end-to-end service provider does not occur. In addition, due to the lowered entry cost, the overall welfare is greater when the entry of downstream-only service is possible although the entire increase in welfare goes to the entrant. Without regulation, however, the vertically integrated incumbent does not voluntarily provide the back-end service to the entrant when the merchant's benefit from the payments service is not sufficiently high. It suggests the need for proper regulatory measures to reach a socially desirable outcome from the new entry in the retail payments market."

This paper examines changes in the demographic structure of North Korea based on the World Population Prospects of the UN: it compares demographic structures between an integrated Korea and the reunified Germany, as well as those between North Korea, China and Vietnam. Based on these comparisons, we could draw some important implications for demographic issues during the transition of North Korea and after reunification. In China and Vietnam, the first demographic dividend effect caused by a sharp decline in the dependency ratio has been pronounced in the process of economic growth since the reform and opening-up. However, North Korea, which had already completed its demographic transition before the 1990s, is unlikely to enjoy the demographic dividend effect in the future even if it attempts to embark on reform and opening-up. Meanwhile, the population integration between North Korea, whose the youth population ratio and total fertility rate (TFR) are higher, and South Korea can delay entering into an aged society by 4 years. It is also expected to make the share of the working-age population increase by up to 4.3%p by 2065, compared to that of South Korea. However, the speed of population aging of an integrated Korea is expected to be faster than that of the reunified germany."

On the contrary, the household loan market has been influenced more greatly by demand factors than by supply factors. Meanwhile, Saving banks loans have been affected mostly by supply factors.

It requires banks to set aside additional capital buffer in times of credit overheating, and allows them to release the buffer when a breakdown in credit intermediation is imminent. To operationalize this buffer, it is important to find information variables that enable policymakers to determine whether current credit activities are overheated, to the extent that it can lead to a significant financial crisis afterwards. We explore indicator variables necessary for implementing countercyclical capital buffer in Korea. To do so, we first collect 42 variables in 7 sectors including credit aggregates, financial markets, and macroeconomic variables. We then evaluate the past performance of those variables to predict financial crises in Korea since 1981, using AUROC(area under receiver operating characteristic), loss function, and noise-to-signal ratio. The results show that credit variables such as the credit to non-financial firms and households are the most useful in determining when to build up the buffer, and so are financial market variables such as credit spread in determining when to release the buffer. A multi-variable approach, using mostly credit aggregate variables, has high explanatory power on the occurrence of past financial crises."

We interpret these results as evidence that, although foreign investors increase adverse selection risks for liquidity providers, they bring net benefits to the market in terms of lower trading costs by increasing competition in the price discovery process. Both the price impact of trades and the bid-ask spread are smaller for companies in the common law countries, and the general increase in foreign ownership in emerging markets after the global financial crisis resulted in higher price impacts and lower spreads."

The results show that inflation for the period from the late 70s to the early 80s and during the foreign currency crisis in the late 90s has been relatively high with the persistence coefficient close to 1. In addition, the monetary policy stance represented by a Taylor-type policy rule has been more aggressive against inflation since 2000 when both inflation and its persistence were low and stable. Also, inflation persistence rather rises with macroeconomics instability under passive monetary policy. Therefore, the monetary policy stance on inflation appears to play an important role in lowering inflation persistence and achieving macroeconomic stability."

We find that the more models included in point forecast combinations leads to the better performance of the combinations than the benchmark autoregressive model, regardless of the independent performance of a single model. We also find that combinations of more models provide a result robust to sample periods. Density forecasts and their combinations present the direction of future inflation and predictive densities.

It also examines the overall macroeconomic effects of the extension of mandatory retirement age on an ageing economy. A decrease in mortality rate raises aggregate capital input in the economy since individuals save more for retirement due to the longer life expectancy and the enlarged proportion of the middle- and older-aged population in the total population. In contrast, an increase in aggregate labor is negligible since most of the population increases are attributable to the increase in the population over 60, most of whom are out of the labor force. A decrease in the fertility rate reduces both aggregate capital and labor inputs because of the reduction in total population, especially in young and middle aged groups. With a reasonable calibration (the mortality rate decreases by 1% a year; and the population growth rate declines from 0.7% to 0.3%), our model forecasts that the aggregate production will decrease by 15% and the pension system will run a big budget deficit with more retirees and smaller number of workers. The model also predicts that the introduction of extension of retirement age (3 years, from 57 to 60) can alleviate the negative effects of population ageing by increasing both aggregate capital and labor inputs and reducing pension deficits."

For the analysis, this paper sets up a theoretical model in which a bank optimizes its asset and funding structure considering the expected profit and its volatility. Then, an empirical estimation is carried out using Korea commercial-bank panel data from 2004.1q-2014.2q. It is found that a decrease in the policy rate or in the house price index brings about a rise in the capital ratio but a fall in the liquidity ratio. Also, an increase in the capital ratio tends to raise the liquidity leverage ratios, while an increase in the leverage ratio raises the capital ratio. Looking at the effects of the regulations, strengthening capital ratio regulation increases the cost of making loans and thereby reduces the amount of loan outstanding and the ratio of loans to total asset. Raising the regulatory liquidity ratio induces an increase in the amount of safe assets and a fall in the ratio of short-term funding to total funding. Meanwhile, the empirical estimation result indicates that the regulations do not significantly affect bank profit and the effectiveness of bank lending channel of monetary policy."

Moreover, it becomes less pronounced in the post-crisis than the pre-crisis, which may have resulted from the increased transparency of policy actions with credible central bank communication. This finding further suggests how such announcements affect liquidity depending on policy environments: first, the liquidity impairment gets more severe with the low level of expertsâ€™ predictability and accuracy, rather than the actual policy change itself. Second, liquidity declines rapidly with unscheduled announcements. Lastly, global factors such as the FOMC announcements or foreign ownership have not contributed substantially to improving liquidity at the time of announcements. Overall, the central bank communication plays a significant role in reducing liquidity impairment by improving the predictability of the policy actions and thus mitigating the information asymmetries between market participants."

As a result, much attention has been drawn to the impact of changes in imported input costs caused by exchange rate fluctuations on the production costs and the prices of export goods. This paper examines how the cost-effect through exchange rate driven adjustments of imported input prices affects the price setting of Korean exporters using input-output tables and export transactions data. The main results of this paper are as follows. First, I calculate imported input shares based on the basic sector classification of input-output tables and observe a considerable amount of heterogeneity. Especially, sectors with a high share of imported inputs, such as petroleum products, semiconductors and basic petrochemical products, are expected to cut the cost even further when the Korean won appreciates. Second, export products with a high share of imported inputs have lower exchange rate pass-through due to offsetting exchange rate effects on their marginal costs. Consequently, the degree of pass-through can vary up to more than 30%p across products. Third, while highly competitive products are set a higher export price, their pass-through effects are to be low as they can afford to absorb exchange rate shocks more effectively. These results suggest that the effect of exchange rate shocks on Korea's export prices may differ across export sectors due to the difference in imported input shares. Therefore, it is necessary to consider such microeconomic aspects when analyzing the impact of exchange rate shocks and drawing up the measures to improve export competitiveness."

For this reason monetary authorities have not taken into consideration region-specific information when conducting analyses on policy effects and policy-related decisions. There have been studies on monetary policies and their differential effects on local regions in large areas facilitating great diversity as the U.S. or the EU. One of the main results shows that U.S. monetary policy has differential regional effects across regions and so does EU monetary policy on its member states. For the possibility of regional differences in monetary policy effects since the local self-goverment system was launched in Korea in 1995, it seems necessary to analyze the effects of monetary policy on the real economy across the local regions. In this paper, we empirically analyze the differential regional impacts of monetary policy on 16 local governments in Korea and examine the factors that have caused such differences. The result from the impulse response analysis of GRDP shows that monetary policy itself has significant effects across the country and that its short-term effect differs across regions. Also, there are significant cross-regional differences in the short run; however, such differences disappear over time. Notably, the regional differences in short-term monetary effects are attributable to the share of interest-sensitive industries, that of small- and medium-sized firms, and interregional linkages."

A higher indirect trade intensity index on the other hand provides better mitigation of the shock from the global financial crisis. In addition, stronger financial linkages aggravate the extent of export decline. When the direct trade linkage is strong enough, Korea's exports decrease with FDI. When the indirect trade linkage is rather strong, on the other hand, FDI and trade, by facilitating vertical trade in intermediate goods, are in a complementary relationship with each other. Lastly, it is notable that the shocks from the rise in U. S. interest rates and the shrinkage of global liquidity amid the weak global recovery may exacerbate the drops in Korea's exports to countries with strong direct trade linkages to Korea."

To do this, this study proposes and estimates macro-finance affine term structure models with a macroeconomic factor and regime shifts. In the model, the vector of exogenous factors consists of the U.S. long-term interest rate and three latent factors. The latent factors determine the shape of the Korean yield curve, and the U.S. interest rate can influence on the Korea yield curve through the latent factors. In addition, the possibility of structural changes in the Korean yield curve dynamics and its relationship with the U.S. interest rate are considered. Our estimation results based on an efficient Bayesian MCMC algorithm reveal that the yield curve of South Korea has experienced one-time drastic structural break in December 2008, and that after the break an unexpected positive shock on U.S. long-term interest rates induces a more substantial increase in the long-term interest rate of South Korea than before the break. Meanwhile, its impact on the Korean short-term interest rate is found to be insignificant at all times. As a result, our findings appear to support the preferred habit hypothesis. We believe that our framework will be useful for quantifying the Fed's normalizing the stance of monetary policy on the government bond markets of emerging countries."

Quantitative easing by major central banks has been accompanied by interest on reserves. New lending facilities have been established, and maturities of open market operations have been extended. The range of eligible collateral against which central banks make lendings has been widened.

 """,2014.,Analysis on the Determinants of Currency Invoicing in Korean Trade (in Korean),"2014-37, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","This study investigates the determinants of currency invoicing in Korean trade by using import and export transactions data between Korea and its 30 major trading partners for the period from 2000 to 2013. Unlike developed countries, where the invoicing currency is largely determined by the bargaining power of exporters and importers, we cannot find a strong substitution effect between the Korean won (KRW) and the trading partner's currency due to the lack of internationalization of the KRW. Also, in case of Korea, a higher market share for the Korean goods in a destination country does not increase the use of the KRW. This owes to a coalescing effect, with Korean firms invoicing in the US dollar in line with their competitors to limit the movement of their relative prices. On the other hand, the higher the level of industry product differentiation, the weaker the coalescing motive. As a result, traders prefer to invoice in either their own currency or their trading partner's currency instead of the US dollar. In addition, the share of invoicing in the currency of Korea's trading partner tends to be higher when trading with a country which has (i) a larger trade volume, (ii) higher level of financial development, (iii) lower inflation and lower price volatility, and (iv) its own currency with lower transaction costs. Taken together, it is necessary to establish a foothold for the expanded use of the KRW in international transactions in order to increase its share as an invoicing currency in trade. To do this, we should maintain macroeconomic stability and improve financial and foreign exchange market infrastructure while enhancing the non-price competitiveness of Korean export goods."

While labor market variables are perceived to be important ingredients to explain business cycle fluctuations, many new Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model literatures based on Korean economy consider output for the real sector variable in the feedback rule. We build a DSGE model with sticky prices and wages and unemployment, estimate the model using Korean data, and compare welfare losses between the rule responding to unemployment and the rule responding to output. We find that the rule responding to unemployment growth is more welfare improving than other rules. It is because unemployment growth contains information on not only output gap, but also price inflation and wage inflation which are components of welfare loss function. Therefore, responding to unemployment growth mitigates inefficiencies from sticky prices and wages at the same time. This result holds with and without uncertainty in output gap and unemployment gap. While, in case of certainty, the rule responding to output gap is more welfare improving than the rule responding to output growth, the result is reversed in case of uncertainty because the rule responding to uncertain output gap measure misleadingly increases fluctuations of other variables. These results imply that, when central banks practice monetary policy, unemployment can be used as a useful feedback variable together with inflation and output variables."

Our empirical analysis focuses on 17 emerging market economies with quarterly data covering the period from September 2005 to September 2013, using dynamic panel models. The results show that the shock-absorbing effects of foreign currency deposits depend upon countries' economic fundamentals. Specifically, those with strong fundamentals can utilize foreign currency deposits to alleviate the rises in sovereign credit swap spreads caused by external shocks. For countries with weak economic fundamentals, however, the impacts of external shocks on sovereign credit swap spreads increase with the holding of foreign currency deposits.

Our empirical analysis also focuses on the relationship between EPL and labor productivity to evaluate the effect of employment protection on economic efficiency. The results from the panel data analysis of OECD countries show that, first, a relaxation of EPL for regular workers reduces temporary employment rate and increases job tenure, whereas, it has no significant effect on wage decile ratio. Second, strengthening EPL for irregular workers reduces temporary employment ratio, increases job tenure, and diminishes wage gap among the regular workers. Third, EPL for regular workers improves the labor productivity growth rate until it reaches a certain level, when the growth rate starts to decline. Fourth, labor market duality is more severe in Korea than it is in other OECD countries. Our empirical results show that it is necessary to continue to reduce the gap between employment protection for regular and irregular workers to resolve the labor market duality. It should be also noted that both excessive and under employment protection can negatively affect the labor productivity. Finally, further research should be conducted to find the reasons of the labor market duality in Korea and its solutions."

The implications for North Korean transition and integration are drawn as follows. North Korea should replace a mono-banking system with a two-tier one by dividing the Chosun Central Bank into two parts: the function of a central bank and that of a commercial bank. Following this division, the part of commercial bank should be privatized using the method of sale to outsiders. The problem of non-performing loans needs to be addressed properly with a sufficient amount of financial resources. It is advised to establish an exchange rate regime that provides a long-term economic stability and competitiveness. For this purpose, a fixed exchange rate regime followed by a floating one should be considered as a default option."

The computation of network entropy hinges on eigenvector centrality and Shannon entropy. Two policy-related findings emerge from this research. First, regarding time variation of network entropy, international diversification of the global financial network constructed from foreign claims of international banks has retreated since the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Foreign claims among 20 reporting countries have become more concentrated on core countries such as US and UK since 2009. The change is more vividly captured by network entropy with an unprecedented drop of the measure. This finding illustrates that network entropy is a more acute measure for diversity of a financial network due to the inclusion of information about financial network structures captured by eigenvector centrality. Second, on the subject of financial linkages, the results reveal sizable regional heterogeneity. In both developing Asia &Pacific area and developing Africa & Middle East area, there is a negative correlation between volatility of changes in foreign claims and international diversification of funding sources measured by funding entropy. In other words, more international diversification is related with lower volatility. Especially in case of developing Europe, however there is no evidence for the relation. This paper also finds interesting regional variations in the relation between international diversification of lending and that of borrowing."

Most of literatures on the Korean labor market have consistently shown evidences of the existence of hysteresis in employment rates and labor force participation rates, but not in unemployment rates. We attribute such inconsistency to persons marginally attached to the labor force and persons employed part time for economic reasons. Therefore, we construct extended measures for unemployment from 2003 to 2013 using micro data of Statistics Korea, and investigate the presence of hysteresis based on the new measures. We have found that the alternative measures of unemployment rates support the existence of hysteresis in the Korean labor market, which is consistent with the result in labor force participation rates and employment rates. The existence becomes more significant for the unemployment rates of female and aged-groups of 30's and 40's. It suggests that the prevention of the persistently high unemployment rates among female and middle-aged group would play an important role in avoiding prolonged recessions and raising potential growths."

When we consider the movements of capital across borders, however, the effect of population ageing could be different from that in the closed economic models. Against this background, this paper conducts empirical analyses on the effect of demographic change on economic growth with allowing capital movements using cross-country panel data from 1965 to 2010 involving 108 countries. First of all, the highly correlated relationship between savings rate and investment rate, so-called Feldstein and Horioka (1980) proposition, has been weakened as time goes by, which implies significant international capital movements in recent decades. Also, as population ageing deepens, both savings rate and investment rate could drop, which implies that the effect of population ageing on growth in a closed economy could be somewhat exaggerated if the necessary investment resources can inflow in an open economy. Further more, the rigorous empirical analyses using cross-country panel data indicate that the capital inflow for necessary investment cancels out the magnitudes of decrease (100%) in economic growth by 9.5~21.9% when non-working age population ratio increases. In addition, this cancellation effects are more significant when the types of capital inflow are FDI or debt rather than portfolio equity and when youth population (under 15 years olds) has more share in non-working age population."

Changes in working hours may have two contrasting effects on hourly productivity: a ""fatigue effect"" and a ""learning effect."" An increase in working hours may lead to the accumulation of a worker's proficiency and skill in his or her job, while it may at the same time cause the level of the worker's fatigue to increase. Estimation of the Cobb-Douglas and translog production functions with Hansen's (1999) threshold regression methods shows that there exist multiple (at most four) thresholds in the linkage between working time and productivity, supporting the existence of a learning effect as well as a fatigue effect from an extension in working hours. The results of our study provide some implications for the recent discussion on reform of the working time system: (i) a reduction in working hours, on one hand, may increase productivity by reducing fatigue and allowing more leisure, but on the other hand, it may hinder workers from accumulating proficiency and skills, thereby reducing their productivity; (ii) the overall effects of changes in working time depend upon a variety of factors, such as the initial level of working hours and the features of the industry concerned."

For this purpose, it derives an empirical model from a sticky information model a la Mankiw and Reis (2002) and estimates it. In addition, it is also examined whether the degree of information rigidity is state-dependent on macroeconomic conditions. The main findings of this paper are as follows. First, it turns out that the information rigidity in Korean householdsâ€™ inflation expectations is very high. In a month, most of the households simply keep their inflation expectations the same as before instead of updating them based on newly arrived information. Furthermore, when updating their expectations, the households tend to rely on the backward-looking information such as actual inflation rates in the past rather than on the forward-looking forecasts by experts. Second, it is found that the degree of information rigidity is varying as inflation rate changes. Specifically, when the inflation is high, the sensitivity of the households' inflation expectations to actual inflation increases and the gap between inflation expectations and actual inflation shrinks. It implies that Korean households update their expectations more frequently when the inflation matters than not."

This paper compares the backgrounds and principles of the unconventional monetary policy conducted by these two central banks. FRB's unconventional measures can be classified into two groups: ones for financial stability and the others for economic stability. The first group of measures - introducing new liquidity supply facilities, intervening MMF markets, for example - has been basically guided by the Bagehot's dictum. Operation twist and quantitative easing fall into the second group of measures, which has been adopted in order to influence longer-term interest rates directly while the short-term policy rate is stuck at the effective zero lower bound. FRB appears to acknowledge the sequentiality of conventional and unconventional measures as long as economic stability is concerned: first conventional then unconventional measures, and in exit, unwinding unconventional measures first before stating to raise the policy rate. In contrast, ECB makes it clear that unconventional measures have been designed and implemented focusing on its primary objective: maintaining price stability. As a result, ECB has emphasized equal treatment of all commercial banks within their ability to provide collateral, in providing liquidities. In fact, ECB mainly uses open market operations (longer-term refinancing operations, in particular) and provides whatever amount of liquidity to commercial banks at its policy rate as long as collaterals are secured. In addition, ECB has a different view that unconventional measures can be deployed before the policy rate hits the zero lower bound, and that the policy rate can be raised before unconventional measures are withdrawn. These differences in principles for unconventional measures seem to reflect institutional and financial-market structure under which the two central banks operate."

Population aging will increase the components of tax revenue and spending, which bear weak relationships to the business cycle. That is, the ratios of the consumption tax revenues and the spendings on age-based entitlement programs to total fiscal revenues and spendings, respectively, will grow owing to a declining share of the working-age population. This change could lead to a weakening of countercyclical automatic adjustment of the fiscal balance. The results, which are mainly derived from the spectral analysis on Korean fiscal and business cycle variables, suggest that the automatic stabilizer has worked in counter-acting output fluctuations in Korea. Also, the cross-country panel analysis of 23 major countries reveals that the level of the elderly dependency ratio (ratio of the number of people aged 65 and above to those aged 15-64), as well as the rising speed of this ratio, reduces the sizes of the automatic stabilizers in the short as well as the long run. This result suggests that population aging is an on-going threat in the Korean economy, where the elderly dependency ratio is rising rapidly. The panel analysis reveals in addition that population aging weakens the function of the automatic stabilizers by suppressing their flexible movements. This paper suggests that it would be necessary to redesign the tax and spending rules in economies facing rapid population aging so that the effectiveness of their automatic stabilizers in smoothing output fluctuations can be improved."

Next, we investigate the impact of Korean population aging on the long-term fiscal conditions using the method of the forward looking measure of Generational Accounting. Most of the deterioration in the fiscal situation of the Japanese government since 1990 can be explained by an increase in social security costs related with population aging and a decrease in tax revenue caused by lackluster economy. Considering the rapid population aging, Korean government's fiscal condition, evaluated to be very sound currently, could also deteriorate soon without counteracting preemptively. The results of Korean Generational Accounting show that the social security related expenditures are main drives for the deterioration of long-term fiscal condition. In addition, as shown by the case of Japan, the effect of the decreased tax revenue could be greater than that of increased expenditure. The policy for improving the tax revenue through economic growth is also very important for the sustainability of government finance."

Furthermore it is becoming ever more important to consider the active roles of international capital flows, which have been increasing sharply since the 1990's. Against this backdrop, this paper conducts an empirical analysis of the relationship between current account rebalancing and exchange rate flexibility with a particular focus on the role of international capital flows. The results show, firstly, that a more flexible exchange rate de facto helps adjust current account deficits or surpluses significantly. Secondly, greater exchange rate flexibility also encourages inflows of portfolio and other investments, leading to offsetting effects that lower the probability of current account adjustment. This finding implies that foreign capital inflows tend to finance deficits in current-account deficit countries, while helping promote productivity in tradable sectors in current account surplus countries. Thirdly, in countries with more flexible exchange rates, the marginal effect of facilitating current account deficit adjustment and capital inflows is smaller; that is, there exist non-linear effects in the role of exchange rate flexibility. Lastly, if the probability of current account surplus adjustment is higher, foreign portfolio investment tends to flow out significantly, but, there is no such systematic relationship in the case of current account deficit adjustment. These results suggest that greater exchange rate flexibility may not always enhance current account rebalancing, and utilizing foreign capital inflows efficiently is crucial in achieving a sound and resilient macro economy."

The results of estimation based on a Bayesian panel VAR model show that the key factors driving them differ depending upon the type of investment flows. To be specific, bond flows are affected more by interest rate differentials, while equity flows respond more elastically to agents' economic expectations for the real economy and the value of the currency. It is also estimated that the relationship between the two types of flows varies in line with the sources of global and domestic shocks. They have moved in similar fashions in response to global shocks, both showing increased inflows when the U.S. economy has improved and moving out when the international financial markets have become unstable. In the event of domestic interest rate shocks, bond inflows have risen while equity inflows have declined, indicating a rotation phenomenon. Lastly, Asian countries have experienced general outflows of bond funds in response to U.S. interest rate hikes. However, outflows from them of equity funds have varied depending upon the prospects for individual countries' real economies. The above findings imply that, although global shocks could lead to greater macroeconomic volatility due to the co-movements of bond and equity flows into Asia, external shocks arising from such co-movements could be mitigated through appropriate policy responses, which have different impacts on bond and equity flows."

We study the impact of globalization through the lens of a structural model. Globalization is modeled as a time-varying degree of openness in the economy. We estimate the model allowing for non-fully rational expectations, learning by economic agents, and incomplete international financial markets. The empirical results show that globalization led to important changes in the macroeconomic environment. Domestic variables have become much more sensitive toward global measures over the 1991-2012 sample. In particular, domestic output and inflation are significantly affected by global output. Fluctuations in Korean output, inflation, and interest rates, which were driven for the most part by domestic shocks in the early 1990s, are due in large part (roughly 70%) to global shocks (and shocks inherent to an open-economy) by the end of the sample."

This paper finds that the yields on KGBs (3-month and 3-year Korean Government Bonds) involve asymmetric term structure. While the existing literature on the term structure of interest rates assumes thatcointegrating relationship is symmetric, but empirical results suggest an asymmetric term structure for KGBs. Asymmetric term structure is found in not only the long-run relationship but also short-run error correction mechanism for KGBs. Specifically, the estimated long-run relationship depends on whether or not the long-term rate is rising. Also, an equilibrium is restored swiftly when the yield on 3-year KGBs is falling, but the speed of adjustment is slow when increasing. This finding reflects that central banks may be apt to raise short-term interest rates gradually but lower them quickly in response to recessions or economic crises. This result is consistent with asymmetric central banksâ€™ policy (Enders and Siklos, 2001; Bohl and Siklos, 2004). This paper suggests CCR (Canonical-Cointegrating-Regression based)-CUSUM test and applies the test to the detection of asymmetric cointegrating relationship between KGBs."

The survey data reveal that imported inputs play a major role in transmitting exchange rate fluctuations to domestic producer prices, and that the degree of exchange rate pass-through tends to be nonlinear and asymmetric: it is higher when changes in exchange rate are large or when the local currency depreciates. A further investigation of the sources of nonlinearity and asymmetry supports the model's prediction that nonlinear pass-through may arise because large exchange-rate movements trigger additional indirect effects via industry-level price movements, while asymmetric pass-through can be driven by capacity constrained firms."

Using Korean microstructure data from 1999 to 2012, we find a permanent negative abnormal return of -1.6% in the South Korean market (and -0.88% for the US market) for nuclear weapons testing, but do not find significant return for military attacks.

It is also known from Barillas et al. (2009) to increase if agents in the economy care about robustness to model misspecification. In this paper, we combine these two effects and calculate the cost of business cycles in an economy with consumers who face individual consumption risk and who fear model misspecification. We find that individual risk has a greater impact on the cost of business cycles if agents already have a preference for robustness. Correspondingly, we find that endowing agents with concerns about a preference for robustness is more costly if there is already individual risk in the economy. The combined effect exceeds the sum of the individual effects."

Findings of this paper suggest that foreign bank branches reduced their lending when the Bank of Korea lowered its base rate substantially to conduct expansionary monetary policy during the global financial crisis period. One of the underlying reasons for this buffering effect by foreign bank branches is the existence of internal capital markets operated by multinational banks to overcome capital market frictions faced when the foreign banks finance their loans."

Overall, the analysis finds robust evidence that foreign banks curtailed the growth of credit relative to other banks, independent of the host region. Foreign bank affiliates from the United States reduced loan growth less than those from other regions. The lending growth of foreign affiliates does not depend on whether their parent banks are global or regional banks. However, the funding structure of foreign bank affiliates and the capitalization of parent banks do help explain the lending behavior of foreign affiliates during the global crisis. Although not the focus of the paper, it also finds that government-owned banks played a countercyclical role in all regions."

However, researches on the effects of internet banking in Korea so far have failed to provide coherent conclusions. This paper tries to analyze the relationships among internet banking, demand deposit and profitability of banks with the method which explicitly considers endogeneity problems. According to our findings, the widespread use of internet banking has enhanced the efficiency of banking business by reducing the reliance of banks on profit from interest and increasing the share of non-interest revenue of banks such as fees. It is, however, found that internet banking does not have significant impacts on the profitability of individual banks. The analysis also shows that internet banking has contributed to an increase in the share of demand deposit. However, the increased share of demand deposit has not affected the profitability of each banks. In conclusion, while the broad use of internet banking has led to a rise in the share of demand deposit, it has had no significant impacts on the profitability of individual banks. These results indicate that banks should develop appropriate measures to make the full use of electronic payment services such as internet banking. Further in-depth researches on the effects of internet banking on the profitability of banks need to be done using accumulated appropriate data in the future."

The drivers of the two dimensional nonlinearities are country-specific factors such as the current account, real effective exchange rate deviation from its historical average, and foreign exchange reserves. The elasticity of portfolio inflows to EMEs with respect to a direct quantitative measure of UMP, growth in the Fed's security assets, tends to be higher with a higher current account, higher exchange rate appreciation expectations, and greater foreign exchange reserve holdings, while the results are the opposite with a price measure of UMP, a change in the US 10-year Treasury yield. These results imply that a price UMP shock from news about or impending QE tapering would more adversely affect an EME with a weaker external sector. If QE tapering is actually implemented with clearer signs of economic recovery in AEs, the increase in global liquidity due to AE recoveries will help EMEs muddle relatively easily through the quantitative shock from the reduction in the Fed's security assets."

 """,2014.,Achieving Balanced Growth Through Service Sector Expansion: Expected Benefits and Risks (in Korean),"2014-4, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Since the global financial crisis, the need for a stronger service sector is emerging to ensure a balanced growth between external and internal markets. If the economy becomes more service-oriented, however, a growing internal demand would eventually lead to a decrease in current account surplus. Also, rising prices of non-tradable goods could trigger a rise in real exchange rates, posing a risk of making tradable goods less attractive in international markets. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the expected effects of balanced growth strategies with a focus on the service sector expansion, as well as relevant risk factors. The analysis suggests that a highly productive service sector with stronger linkages to a manufacturing sector is associated with a higher productivity growth in the whole economy. Meanwhile, the service sector expansion could also lead to rising real exchange rates and deteriorating current account balance. Still, those risk factors would diminish if such expansion is accompanied by higher productivity in the service sector. Thus it will be desirable to achieve a balanced growth between external and internal markets by pursuing both quantitative and qualitative growth in the service sector, rather than merely by focusing on its expansion in size."

First, regardless of the time point examined, nearly all of the average sectoral correlation is attributable to macroeconomic common shocks, which the fraction of sectoral correlation attributable to sectorspecific shocks is generally very small. Second, among six macroeconomic shocks considered in this paper, shocks to the domestic business cycle and those to monetary policy are the two major sources of sectoral comovements. Also important are shocks to the world business cycle and oil prices. In contrast, shocks to the domestic price level and government spending could explain only a small fraction of the average sectoral correlation. Third, the amounts of sectoral correlation due to domestic business cycle shocks, world business cycle shocks, and government spending shocks have decreased substantially over the past two decades. On the contrary, shocks to oil prices and monetary policy have shown a rapid increase in their contribution to sectoral comovements."

Measuring the influence of the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility on SMEs' credit availability is important for evaluating and improving the system. Bank-firm level data from 2009 to 2011 are used for this analysis. The results show that the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility helps increase bank loans to SMEs and decrease lending rates. These effects are particularly prominent for enterprises with medium-credit scores (ratings 5-6), start-ups, and enterprises newly eligible for the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility. Enterprises tend to access loans from a greater number of banks after being included in the system, implying that it does influence banks' decisions by reducing information asymmetry between banks and enterprises. This is the first study which empirically analyzes the effect of the BOK's credit policy on SMEs. Its findings have significant implications for credit policy, which has been increasingly adopted by central banks since the global financial crisis."

In this paper we show how credit ratings have value in equilibrium and how reputation insures that in equilibrium ratings will reflect the correct assessment of credit worthiness. There will always be an information distortion because of the fact that purchasers of ratings need not reveal them. We argue that regulatory reliance on ratings and the increasing importance of risk-weighted capital in prudential regulation have more likely contributed to distorted ratings than the matter of who pays for them. In this respect, much of the regulatory obsession with the conflict created by issuers paying for ratings is misguided."

In contrast, no risks arising from the Korean repo market have yet emerged in practice thanks in part to its small market volume during the global financial crisis, but it could give rise to significant risks due to some fragility arising from factors such as the increase of trade concentration. For this reason, we wish to identify some weak points, and suggest some areas for improvement such as a ceiling on the amount of borrowing, and on the proportion of illiquid collateral held by investors. In addition, we discuss the need for the greater differentiation of margin, and for the extension of the intraday repo facility to the repo market."

We find that an increase in household loans is a leading indicator of systemic risk. In particular, systemic risk is related more to household loans from non-banks than to those from banks, and more to unsecured loans than to secured loans. This paper also shows that systemic risk is associated with the credit information pertaining to multiple-loan borrowers as well as non-bank borrowers holding medium-to-high credit. This study is distinctive in that the above relationship is verified based on the vast amount of data provided by credit bureaus (CBs).

Second, we find that systemic risk contributions are closely related to certain bank characteristic variables (e.g., VaR (value at risk), size and leverage ratio). However, there are differences between the cross-sectional and the time series dimensions in the effects of these variables.

Specifically, in forecasting for more volatile periods like the global financial crisis during 2008-09, various hybrid models predict the inflection point better than AR model does. The auxiliary finding is that the main ingredients of Korean macroeconomic variables as indicated by SPCA include interest rates, construction orders received, and employment variables.

The global financial crisis demonstrated that a sharp deleveraging can be transmitted to emerging markets through the bank lending channel to a slowdown in credit growth.

Impulse responses from a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model calibrated to Korea shows that it appears better prepared to handle such shocks relative to 2008. Indeed, Korea is much more resilient to such shocks due to the efforts by the authorities, which has led to the strengthening of external buffers, such as higher foreign exchange reserves and bilateral and multilateral currency swap arrangements."

In commercial banks as well as MSBs, however, our estimated Boone Indices suggest that competition was much higher before the recent global financial crisis, but after then it has gradually declined. As Boyd and De Nicolo (2005) suggest, competition has a positive effect on the stability of MSBs with greater business risk and weaker corporate governance. In reality, higher concentration and risk-shifting effects in a less competitive loan market have increased default risks of some MSBs since the recent crisis. Commercial banks, on the contrary, tend to be less stable when they face competition pressure while the relationship is nonlinear."

It tries to establish a set of models that determine the original amount and delinquency of loans, using as independent variables financial and non-financial factors extracted from individual accounts and regulatory factors such as macroprudential tools. Our empirical findings suggest several meaningful implications. First, the application of LTV and DTI regulations at the date of borrowing turns out to be very effective in reducing the amount of loans and household's leverage (loan-to-income ratio or loan-to-collateral ratio) and also in mitigating defaults. Second, it is found that changes in housing prices are closely related to the loan size and its delinquency. A rise in housing prices drives up borrowings due to household's affirmative attitude. Conversely, their downturn has a negative impact on the soundness of existing loans, heightening the motive for strategically defaulting, notably when the auction price of a collateral house is below its loan balance. Recently, loan demand has become less sensitive to interest rates due to the upsurge in borrowings for daily living expenses and business funds. Lastly, our vintage and age cohort analyses show that there are relatively higher default risks in loans extended during the period of steeply rising housing prices and in those of seniors whose loan-to-income ratios are much higher."

The results from the empirical analyses using regional and country data have confirmed the following hypotheses derived from the framework: First, that it is agricultural development that generates positive external effects on industrial development, and not vice versa.

(i) We first construct a simple equilibrium model of a small open economy with mobile capital. Then (ii) we extend the basic model to analyze the effects of factor market openness. From calibration, we find that the effects of SBTC exist in the small open economy and could be larger than those of a closed economy. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence from the KLIPS data which supports the results from calibration analysis. Our regression analysis demonstrates that the skill premium is larger in the high-tech industries that are more likely to be affected by SBTC. Some implications are discussed."

Our method incorporates not only direct liquidity shortages but also indirect liquidity shortages due to the knock-on effects through interbank linkages. We perform a simulation with a simple banking system model and find that a deficit bank can mitigate a liquidity shortage by holding more claims on a surplus bank. Meanwhile, a greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks tends to aggravate the liquidity shortage of a deficit bank. According to comparative analysis between different types of network structures, a core-periphery network with a deficit money center bank gives rise to the highest level of systemic liquidity shortages, and a banking system becomes more vulnerable to liquidity shocks as its interbank network becomes more ill-matched."

 """,2013.,"Cash, Checkable Deposits and Cost of Inflation","2013-3, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","The Welfare cost of inflation is revisited with a search-theoretic model wherein distinct features of cash and checkable deposits as means of payment are incorporated. Our result implies that the presence of an interest-bearing checkable deposit amplifies the cost of inflation significantly via a channel of option value of money. Put differently, the cost of inflation is substantially underestimated under the assumption of non-interest-bearing M1. This is in stark contrast to the previous studies in which the assumption of non-interest-bearing M1 leads to a considerable overvaluation of an inflation cost. This finding provides the rationale for a low inflation target by the central bank where the payment system is highly developed."

 """,2013.,Capital Inflow Shocks and House Prices: Aggregate and Regional Evidence from Korea,"2013-2, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Over the course of the recent global financial crisis, emerging economies experienced massive swings in capital inflows. In this paper, we estimate a VAR model to assess the impact of capital inflow shocks, which are identified using a set of sign restrictions, on house prices in Korea. We base the analysis on three alternative measures of capital inflows: net total inflows, net portfolio inflows and gross total inflows. The results suggest that capital inflow shocks have a significantly positive and persistent effect on real house prices. Although shocks to capital inflows are found to be substantially more important for Korean asset markets than for other OECD countries, their overall explanatory power is modest. Using regional house price data we also show that capital inflow shocks have an asymmetric effect on property markets across the seven largest Korean cities and across different parts of Seoul."

Korea had in fact operated several MaPP measures, but could not shield itself from the impacts of the global financial crisis in 2008 because of a new type of financial imbalance accumulated in the 2000s. The implications are summarized with respect to the objectives, scopes, and other elements of the MaPP policy framework: that the objectives of MaPP measures should be set in the macroprudential dimension rather than from a microprudential perspective; that the MaPP measures should be devised in ways that reduce the possibility of regulatory arbitrage or minimizes the boundary problems; that MaPP measures in the forms of ratio regulations may need to be supplemented, with for example caps on borrowings or debts; that when revising MaPP measures it will be very important to maintain their initially intended purposes; that MaPP measures need to be flexible to incorporate structural changes in the financial and real sectors preemptively; that, in the case where several MaPP measures are applied simultaneously, consideration should be given to the issue of their coordination and the interrelationships among them."

 """,2012.,Capital Inflows and Exchange Rate Volatility in Korea,"2012-16, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","High exchange rate volatility threatens international trade and exacerbates the currency mismatch problem, hence generating economic instability. However, low exchange rate volatility may cause another problem. Low volatility induces speculative capital inflows as speculative investors, who are usually concerned both with the interest rate differential and exchange rate risk, become concerned with the interest rate differential only. In this paper we use several techniques to identify the relationship between exchange rate volatility and capital inflows in Korea. First, estimation of a Markov switching model shows that all kind of capital inflows increase under low volatility regimes, while capital inflows with the exception of FDI all decrease under high volatility regimes. Second, estimation of a multivariate GARCH-in-Mean Model and the impulse response function derived from it provide evidence that lower exchange rate volatility tends to increase most types of capital inflows other than FDI. These results imply that a medium level of exchange rate volatility is most beneficial for economic stability."

 """,2012.,The Impact of Strengthened Basel III Banking Regulation on Lending Spreads: Comparisons across Countries and Business Models,"2012-15, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","We estimate required increase in banks' lending spreads assuming that banks would raise lending spreads among the measures they could take to prevent ROE from falling when the capital regulation is tightened following the estimation methodology employed by King (2010) or Elliott (2010). Major factors affecting the lending spreads are the ratio of RWA to total assets, the relative size of loan to total assets or the long term interest rate on debt, ceteris paribus. The estimation results show that required lending spreads vary greatly across the banks of various business models or country by country. We find that the required lending spreads to keep ROE from falling vary from 0.1 basis points for real estate & mortgage banks to 9.1 basis points for commercial banks over the sample periods of 2005~2010 while it decreases after the 2007~2008 global financial crisis. Countries such as Brazil, China, India, and Mexico require the banks to have large lending spreads ranging from 13.2 basis points to 29.7 basis points. On the other hand, countries such as Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and Netherland require them to increase smaller lending spreads for the increase in the regulatory capital. Apart from the capital regulation, we find that liquidity regulation (NSFR) increases lending rates by 20.0 basis points for the commercial banks of the sample countries."

 """,2012.,Mitigating Systemic Spillovers from Currency Hedging,"2012-13, Economic Research Institute, Bank of Korea.","Korea has been a forerunner in incorporating macroprudential policies to mitigate the vulnerabilities from currency crises that can turn into a more generalized liquidity crisis. This paper examines longer-term design issues for a more resilient and stable financial system that can complement the existing macroprudential measures. In the period before the Lehman crisis of 2008, rapid growth of short-term foreign currency denominated debt in Korea was the result of banks receiving forward dollar sales by exporters and asset managers, and then hedging the long dollar position by borrowing short in dollars. Our paper examines the rationale and mechanics of a new public financial institution, provisionally called the Exchange Stabilization Corporation (ESC) whose main role is to allow Korean exporters to hedge their currency exposure without generating currency or maturity mismatch in the Korean financial system as a whole. Three features of the ESC enable such a role: (1) it is fully equity-financed, rather than debt financed like a bank (2) its gains and losses are evaluated in US dollars, and (3) it holds a portfolio of both US dollar-denominated and Korean won-denominated assets. The ESC maintains a fully hedged position by switching between assets in different currencies while balance sheet size is fixed. This is in contrast to banks, who hedge their currency exposure by expanding the balance sheet by taking on more short-term dollar denominated debt. This paper is intended as a contribution to discussions about policies toward longer-term financial resilience, rather than about short-term crisis management policies in the light of current financial developments. More detailed research and study on feasibility of the ESC would be needed before it can be put in place."

In addition, we estimate the contributions of individual banks to systemic risk using CoVaR and MES (Marginal Expected Shortfall). CoVaR is estimated based on the methodology of Adrian and Brunnermeier (2010), and MES is estimated based on Shapley value methodology which has been introduced by Tarashev, Borio and Tsatsaronis (2010)."

We conjecture that these factors are well captured by wholesale funding, off-balance sheet transactions, mark-to-market accounting, and cross-border activities. We determine each factorâ€™s weight for the indicator based upon its contribution to the business cycle. We calculate the indicator using the balance sheet data of domestic banks in Korea, and find that it issues warning signals at least one year in advance of financial crises and may complement the credit-to-GDP gap that does not explicitly reflect the systemic risk factors."

The wage policy of reunified Germany is generally said to have been one of the major reasons for the increase in unification costs there, because it led to East German worker wages in excess of their productivity level. To reduce the costs of unification, Korea therefore needs to apply wage policies different from reunified Germanyâ€™s and from South Koreaâ€™s, which requires a new type of integration. Against this backdrop, this paper classifies the integration types into three?a unitary state, a federation, and an SAR (Special Administrative Region)?and analyzes their relative economic effects under the assumption that each type is accompanied by different wage policies. According to this analysis, the federation type shows unemployment and growth patterns similar to those observed in East Germany, the unitary state type higher unemployment and lower growth than in East Germany, and the SAR type lower unemployment and higher growth."

As such, highly procyclical components of money reflect incremental bank lending that may reverse abruptly as financial conditions deteriorate. Components of monetary aggregates that correspond to cross-border banking sector flows depend sensitively on both domestic and global financial factors and display a procyclical pattern that may be utilized in constructing a set of indicators of the vulnerability of the financial system to crises. We illustrate our arguments by drawing on the experience of Korea and by presenting an empirical analysis of cross-border banking flows into â€œdemand pullâ€ and â€œsupply pushâ€ components."

Chortareas and Kapetanios (2004), however, report strong evidence in favor of a Balassa-Samuelson type model of PPP by applying a nonlinear unit root test by Kapetanios et al. (2003) for the other G7 and Asian currencies relative to the Japanese yen, claiming that the yen real exchange rate may be (trend) stationary. We question the validity of this remark. First, we note that their claim is upset when we extend the data until 2008 even when the same nonlinear unit root test is used. Second, we apply the inf- ? test by Park and Shintani (2005, 2010) which does not require the Taylor approximation, and find strong evidence against nonstationarity for most yen real exchange rates. Our results also corroborate the findings of Kim and Moh (2010) who report a possibility of misspecification problems with the use of Taylor-approximation based tests."

The quality of a central bank's communication strategy can influence speculators' strategies, which is a mechanism by which the contagion of a currency crisis from another country evolves either negatively or positively (i.e., increases or reduces the probability of the country experiencing acurrency crisis). The result of the analysis of the threshold for a currency crisis for each country indicate that an increase in communication (i.e., providing more public information) by the central bank can facilitate positive contagion effects while reducing negative effects. Further, public information provides a ""focal point"" for speculators and makes policy tools more effective in promoting positive contagion effects. However, the effectiveness of accurate public information depends critically on the exante expected state of the economic fundamentals of the country."

After creditors observe what occurs in a rollover game for a firm, they conjecture one anotherâ€™s â€œtypeâ€ or attitude toward the risk associated with the firmâ€™s investment project. Creditorsâ€™ inference about one anotherâ€™s type then influences their decision to lend to the next firm. By providing an analysis of the â€œincidence of failureâ€ (the threshold for a liquidity crisis) for each firm, this paper demonstrates that the risk of contagion increases sharply if it originates ex ante from a firm facing a low probability of failure. In addition, the paper proposes some policy measures for mitigating the severity of contagion during a liquidity crisis."

Using the PSID (1968-2007), we find that the movement of the return to experience is almost perfectly explained by demographic changes alone, with no role attributable to demand shifts. Moreover, these demographic changes account for the differential dynamics of the age premium across education groups emphasized by Katz and Murphy (1992), and account for the differential movements of the college premium across age groups emphasized by Card and Lemieux (2001). Thus, our analysis attributes a key role to demographic change in shaping several empirical regularities that are a focus of active research in macro and labor economics."

It is found that the related risk factors and the demand-supply imbalance are significant determinants of the deviations from fundamental levels of the IRS as well as the CRS rate in Korea. Moreover, the CIP deviation in the CRS market plays a role in explaining the deviation from the fundamental level of the IRS rate. There are contemporaneous links among the CRS rate, the IRS rate and the KTB rate, and a CRS rate shock significantly affects both the IRS and the KTB rates."
